The rewards for winning are minuscule, but it’s a great way to kill time in-between waiting for my next booster pack to be ready. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It could be mere weeks until Activision opens up about the Call of Duty League 2025 roadmap. The long-awaited arrival of this season’s competitive ecosystem has been made even more exciting by the success of Black Ops 6, which is proving to be a winner for players both novice and pro.</p>



<p>Recent claims have outlined the season structure for the year ahead, with it being suggested that Activision is adding in ‘Minors’ alongside the existing ‘Major’ structure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-to-europe">Going to Europe</h2>



<p>One of the most electrifying rumours, which is all but confirmed at this point, is that the 2025 COD League season is headed to Europe for the first time in several years. In the new year, Major I will take place in Barcelona, Spain, and it’ll be hosted by Toronto Ultra. Here’s the full (rumoured) schedule for the COD League 2025 season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: Barcelona</li>



<li>Major II: Texas</li>



<li>Major III: Florida</li>



<li>Major IV: Chicago</li>



<li>Champs: Toronto</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.breakingpoint.gg/posts/the-2025-call-of-duty-league-season-structure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breaking Point has claimed</a> that Activision will host a series of ‘Minors’ going into the 2025 season. These one-shot tournaments will offer a $20,000 prize for the winner, and they’ll be a neat opportunity for pro players to secure more CDL points.</p>



<p>Presently, the rumour is that the Minor events are only lined up alongside Major I and II as sort of a ‘testing phase’. Per the claims, a Minor will incorporate all twelve CDL teams playing online across a four-day weekend.</p>



<p>BP also suggested that this year’s season will feature a whopping 246 matches, one of the most we’ve seen in Call of Duty esports history. This will include 160 online fixtures, 72 Major matches, and 14 ‘post-season’ matches.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumoured structure for the CDL 2025 season? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

There’s a new region with new loot and quests, a higher level cap, new crafting tier, new dynamic weather changes, and lots more. It’s the biggest update since the game launched in early access.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the uninitiated, Enshrouded is a third-person survival game that takes place in Embervale, a massive open world that up to 16 players can explore at once. The game world is entirely made out of voxels, and you can terraform the world around you to build a base, castle, or even a village block by block. There are tons of options to build your ideal home. Want an underground lair? You can build that. How about a base inside a mountain cave? You can do that too. Or maybe you’d prefer a treehouse. You guessed it, you can do that too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not as concerned with all that and would prefer to build something quickly, then no worries. There are pre-made elements like building blocks and furniture you can use to easily get a base up and running. Regardless of how you go about creating your base, you can then bring friendly NPCs back to it to help you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first start a new game, you’ll have nothing but the clothes on your back. You’ll need to gather materials to craft new gear, or you can find valuable loot in the Shroud, a dangerous area full of monsters and covered in fog that will kill you if you stay in it too long. So you need to get in, gather loot, and get out before falling victim to the monsters or fog.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-wild-cyclops-logo-1730321591648.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s action RPG combat, so you’ll choose from a variety of weapons and make use of dodges and parries to avoid damage and take down enemies. As you progress, you’ll unlock the ability to specialize in one of three classes: Trickster, Battlemage, or Survivor, each with its own sub-classes for further specialization. In addition to dealing with monsters and the harsh environment, you’ll also need to stay fed and hydrated to be at your best. It’s a survival game at heart, after all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enshrouded launched in early access on PC in January, and Souls of the Frozen Frontier marks the most significant update to the game since. The biggest addition is a large new explorable region called the Albaneve Summits, which brings with it new environments, building materials, quests, lore, collectibles, and wildlife.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The region is designed to challenge even the strongest and best-equipped players. There are lots of new enemies with new attacks and tactics to keep you on your toes. And the new environments include ice and deep snow, which will require you to use caution while you explore. The ice is slippery, and you can get stuck in the deep snow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-new-playable-area-2-logo-1730314076632.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just the new environments you’ll need to contend with. The update also added dynamic weather changes, like rain and extreme cold, that can be dangerous for the unprepared. There are new crafting recipes, so you’ll need to make some gear to protect yourself from the cold.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-armor1-logo-1730314118231.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of crafting, the update added a new crafting tier with recipes that use new materials introduced with the Albaneve Summits. You can also now craft new fitting gear for the game’s various classes and sub-classes. The overall level cap has also been raised to 35, which adds new levels for spells, new skills, and new types of perks that can be unlocked during character progression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve always been able to craft and then equip different gliders on your back that let you travel through the air at high speeds. But the Albaneve Summits add a new traversal mechanic: updrafts on mountainsides, which let you gain height while gliding so you can stay airborne longer. It’s great for traveling across large sections of the area quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Souls of the Frozen Frontier also brings some changes to your base. If you’ve played Enshrouded and wanted your base to feel more lively, then we have some good news. There are new NPCs across Embervale you can bring back to your base, and as you add more people, you’ll get new stories, quests, and dialogue. There are also new assistants you can add to your secondary bases who will provide access to all the recipes of the original crafting NPCs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More interested in filling your base with animals? Well, you can do that too. There’s new wildlife to tame and bring home to your farm, and there are some previously existing non-aggressive animals that can be tamed and added to your base for the first time. If the animals you bring home are fed and comfortable, they can settle down and start a family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also new pets — including cats and dogs — you can find across Embervale who can call your base home if you build up enough trust with them. And in case you’re curious — yes, you can pet your farm animals and pets.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/30/en-pet-cat-logo-1730314198508.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Enshrouded is available in early access now <a href="https://connect.enshrouded.com/IGN_Update4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a>, and the Souls of the Frozen Frontier update comes included at no additional cost.

It will also include Black Ops 6's integration with Warzone, adding the game's new mechanics and features into battle royale.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launched with 16 brand-new maps, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-op-6s-nuketown-map-is-live-with-double-xp/1100-6527514/" data-ref-id="1100-6527514">Nuketown was just recently added</a> as the first DLC map.

			<p>The newest <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/from-the-rift-season-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major update</a> for Apex Legends is out, and is titled From The Rift. In this update, fans will be able to relive the original Apex Games in Launch Royale, where you'll be able to play Lifeline, who is revived with new abilities. Launch Royale takes players back to the original Kings Canyon, where you'll get to experience the game as it initially started, playing with only the original Legends, Weapons, and Loot. With this, it means there are no EVO Armor or Ability Upgrades, and you have to rely on fast reactions and skill to be able to survive in this game mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Apex Legends: From the Rift Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ve-pSwKn79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When it comes to Lifeline, she is back and better than ever. With this, Lifeline is revived as a "Frontline menace." This sees Lifeline get a new kit, where she can teleport DOC to allies who need healing, as well as the ability to deploy a forcefield that makes healing more effective for the whole squad. With a healer this strong, there will be a lot more chaos than there was previously.</p>
<p>In addition to the Launch Royale being added back to Apex Legends, players will be able to get Rift Relics. This will be noticeable due to the appearance of cosmic portals, which are the signal for a Rift Relic. This comes with some of the most iconic, overpowered weapons in the series, along with Boost Kits, which can make or break the build for the players who manage to get their hands on the Rift Relic. To get the Rift Relic, you just have to destroy it to get the reward. However, if it moves outside of the Ring, you may not be able to get the reward as it becomes unstable.</p>
<p>Finally, a brand-new Universal Melee cosmetic is being added to the game called Raptor's Claw. This is a universal Melee cosmetic that you'll be able to get through the Void Mercenary Store from November 5 through to January 7. Additionally, once you've unlocked this cosmetic, you'll be able to get the Crystal Chamber Death Box, which has five other variants to match the Death Boxes. The Raptor's Claw cosmetic will then be moved to the Mythic Shop after January 7.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-removes-steam-deck-support-due-to-cheating/">massive update</a> for Apex Legends and adds a ton of new content, including new support class perks and better skill displays. This is intended to help balance out the matches better and will update live as each player loads into the game, showing you the ranking of the other players you're up against.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/stamp-swap-review-return-to-sender<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the things that made the Stonemaier Games mega-hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather"><i>Wingspan</i></a> so special was the way it delighted in the hobby of birding. Now, Stonemaier aims to trade on another niche hobby, stamp collecting, with its brand new <i>Stamp Swap</i>. Stonemaier sent along a review copy for us to try, so read on for my thoughts on <i>Stamp Swap</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How Do You Play <i>Stamp Swap</i>?</h2>

<p>In <i>Stamp Swap</i>, one to five players compete to collect, swap, and show off their stamp collections, earning points along the way. At the end of three rounds, the player with the most points (after a final round of scoring) wins the game. Each of the three rounds of the game consist of three phases, which I’ll quickly dive into below.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stamp-swap-stamp-tiles.jpg?itok=2ekz1F8o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stamp-swap-stamp-tiles.jpg?itok=C9jf8NXV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h3>The Collect Phase</h3>

<p>First, players will reveal a number of cards which tells them how many stamp tiles to lay out on the board. Some of the stamps will be face-up, and others will be face-down. There are also additional cards you may lay down, and small special rules that may affect this phase. Once the stamp tiles are set down, you’ll each take turns taking stamps from the collection in the middle. Then we move onto the Swap Phase.</p>

<h3>The Swap Phase</h3>

<p>This is the most interesting aspect of the game, in my opinion, where you’ll make an “I sort, you choose” grouping of the stamp tiles you’ve collected. You’ll divide all of your tiles (save for one reserved tile) into two piles, and your opponent will choose one of the piles, and you’ll keep the other. This repeats with multiple players until everyone’s taken their tiles, and the table moves onto the Show Phase.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stamp-swap-i-sort-you-choose.jpg?itok=_ghlO_fZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stamp-swap-i-sort-you-choose.jpg?itok=9sgbpnVk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorting tiles each turn into two piles, your opponent will get first choice, and you'll take the leftover.</figcaption></figure><h3>The Show Phase</h3>

<p>In the Show Phase, you’ll select from one of four scoring metrics on the board (which have been randomly dealt at the start of the game), and lay out your stamp tiles on your board. Based on those metrics (all of one color in a group, rectangles in a group of stamps, all of one theme, etc.) as a guide, you’ll lay out the tiles however suits you on your board and score for the round. This becomes a fun, not-too-puzzle-y game of tile placement.</p>

<h2>Clean Design Or Lack Of Depth?</h2>

<p>This is the central question I’m struggling with as I write this review: is <i>Stamp Swap</i> a simple game, with clean design? Or is it <i>too</i> simple, lacking in the kind of depth and interlocking mechanisms that are usual hallmarks of a Stonemaier game? I think answer to that question has a lot to do with what you’re looking for from the game.</p>

<p>If you do come to <i>Stamp Swap</i> expecting a Stonemaier Game, you’ll find the high production quality and charming artwork that comes standard from one of their releases. The tiles depicting stamps all have a wonderfully appealing retro look, and the board design is unfussy and uncluttered. From that respect, this game absolutely meets the high standards of a Stonemaier game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stamp-swap-achievement-board.jpg?itok=ankFbctn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stamp-swap-achievement-board.jpg?itok=F1HWk8L6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you’re <i>also</i> expecting the kind of gameplay that many of their games sport, though, I'm afraid this will feel a little bit, for lack of a better term, standard. To put it plainly, there's a bit of magic missing here.</p>

<p>But this isn't to say its a bad game by any means. For players looking for an easy, breezy tile-laying game, they'll certainly find it in <i>Stamp Swap</i>, but games like <i>Azul</i> or <i>Patchwork</i> achieve this while taking up less space on the table. <i>Stamp Swap</i> does distinguish itself with the “I sort, you choose,” mechanic of the Swap Phase of the game, but there’s not enough game there to help this rise above the rest.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stamp-swap-array-of-stamps.jpeg?itok=wzLer-iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stamp-swap-array-of-stamps.jpeg?itok=ysDUpU2q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Stamp Swap - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Though the game cleverly aligns itself to the hobby of stamp collecting, <i>Stamp Swap</i> doesn’t quite stick. There are fun elements at play here, but it isn’t enough to help this game rise above other tile-laying games in the genre. Obviously if you’re a fan of stamp collecting, this will be a thematic hit. Also, if you like the “I sort, you choose” mechanic in and of itself, this entire game hinges on that and you’ll find a lot to love here. But for the everyday gamer there are better options out there that ask you to puzzle things out similarly.</p>

The chances are, if you’re among them, the massive amount of content and currencies can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you don’t have any previous experience with the series or other free-to-play games. This guide will explain everything you need to know about <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket.</em></p><h2 id="h37650"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket?</em></strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-recommend-id="image://89391669c744d9d46396528c3c02c663" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Packs to open in PTCG Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name implies, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is a free-to-play mobile version of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> and is available on iOS and Android. The app offers a lighter simulation of the excitement of the physical game, letting you open up booster packs, add them to your “binder,” and use those cards to build decks and battle other players or the computer. Much like the real TCG, you can choose to approach it as you prefer, whether that’s by collecting all the cards to admire the stellar artwork, or to create a brutal arsenal of <em>Pokémon </em>that will crush other players online.</p><p>You can also engage in different missions that provide rewards upon completion. Some of them can be fairly simple, such as opening a pack, while others could require you to collect specific cards or register a set number in the Card Dex—basically the record of your collection. Most of these will be completed just by playing the game, but you do need to remember to go into the Mission Menu to collect your rewards.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-recommend-id="image://1ed7ae4b689c6d7a634f800183d1a917" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dex Missions list." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much like the real world, you get more cards by opening booster packs. However, unlike their physical counterparts which contain ten cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>boosters (like those gained through code cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Live</em>) only contain five. The launch set is called Genetic Apex, with three different booster pack arts, Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. These three types each have some specific cards unique to them: for example, if you want the Pikachu ex card, it’s only available in the Pikachu pack.</p><p>If there’s a particular card you’re looking for, make sure you are opening the correct type of pack. The card list for each, as well as their percentage chance of being pulled, can be viewed by tapping the “Offering Rates” Button in the left corner.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just open as many packs as you want. You need to make sure you have enough Pack Stamina, which refills automatically on a timer. Every 12 hours, the bar refills, allowing you to open up another pack. For those bad at math, this means you can open two packs a day, receiving only ten new cards a day. Fortunately, the game has some ways to speed up this timer, as well as other methods to get new cards, like the Wonder Pick.</p><p>The Wonder Pick is basically a roulette where you can select one random card from a pack that another player has opened. Don’t worry, you aren’t stealing from them, you are just getting a chance to get the same card they pulled. Depending on the rarity of the cards in their booster, it could cost up to three Wonder Stamina, which also refills on a timer. Wonder Pick can be a great way to get a specific card, but given the randomized nature of what you get, it can be frustrating spending three Wonder Stamina trying to get a full-art or EX card, only to get a garbage common one. Still, the option is there, so you might as well use it, especially once you start filling out your collection and need incredibly specific cards to complete it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-recommend-id="image://54093d3561b3a6fc6ab168bc5f3b37d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you open a pack, your cards are automatically added to the “My Cards” section, which can be viewed by pressing the second button from the left on the bottom of the screen. From here, you can create specific binders to show off cards from your collection, or build a display board to highlight a favorite card. This section also lets you add “Flair” to individual cards, which is just a cosmetic effect such as sparkles or bubbles, by consuming duplicates and Shine Dust. If you are having trouble adding flair to a card you have multiples of, make sure you have the correct quantity of copies of the card and ensure you will still have at least two remaining after the flair is purchased. Also note that Shine Dust is only used to add flair, so don’t worry about hoarding it.</p><p>By pressing a tab near the top of the screen, you can also toggle between recently added cards and their quantities, or have the cards organized by their placement in the expansion. The former is useful in quickly searching if you have enough duplicates to add flair, while the latter can be incredibly helpful in determining what is needed to fill holes in your collection.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-recommend-id="image://83f37efad4790fe5d69562cf474a240c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Premium Pass screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the many ways to spend money in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>is the Premium Pass subscription. This gives you access to an additional Stamina bar that refills every 24 hours, allowing one more pack to be opened per day. You will also gain access to Premium Missions that offer a unique currency called “Premium Tickets,” used for special rewards and cosmetics such as promo cards, or battle cosmetics like coins and sleeves. It costs $9.99 per month, which is a little steep for what you get, but there is a two-week free trial if you want to try to complete all the missions to snatch up the first set of redeemables, which are Mewtwo themed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-recommend-id="image://e981e3a5455dd7aea234cab3688ecc49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The various hourglasses you can get in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>By playing the game and completing missions, you will probably notice you’re obtaining at least two types of hourglass items: Pack Hourglasses and Wonder Hourglasses. Both of these are consumables that can be used to refill their respective Stamina bar by one hour. For example, if you just opened a booster pack, you can use 12 Pack Hourglasses to immediately open another one.</p><p>You will gain these items by completing daily missions, or by leveling up, but you can also purchase them in the Shop by using a whole different type of currency called “Shop Tickets.” These are gained by completing the game’s “Step Up Battles,” which are <em>TCG Pocket’s</em> Computer Controlled fights, by completing Event Missions, and from gifts sent by other players after you’ve battled or Wonder Picked with them. It may be tempting to hoard your Hourglasses, but they can only be used to open packs, so don’t feel bad about using them to do so. Though, if you do save up 120 Pack Hourglasses, you can open ten packs at once which is a very cool experience.</p><p>When you first start the game, it’ll throw buckets of hourglasses at you, until you get very used to having them. Then it rather sharply reduces that rate, while nudging that you could always buy some more, so be careful not to get sucked into the sense that they’ll keep on flowing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-recommend-id="image://71007cebf26571e5ac9d84c03f1b4fa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Poke Gold shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wouldn’t be a free-to-play game without a premium currency, so of course <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>has one of those. Among many other ways to spend it, the creatively named Poké Gold can be used to speed up your Stamina bar if you find yourself short on hourglasses. You can use a combination of both Gold and hourglasses, and the game will automatically apply the most efficient usage of both. There is also currently bonus gold for buying the $1, $5 and $10 packages, but note these bonuses can only be used for each increment once.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-recommend-id="image://1563994953f600df48613bfed8a59aca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of some of the Shop screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Yes, there are more currencies. Mentioned briefly above, Shop Tickets are obtained by completing different missions or battles, and can be redeemed to buy item cards, different cosmetics, or hourglasses. These are probably the most versatile currency in the game, so they should be used on whatever you prefer. There are also Emblem Tickets which are awarded by completing Dex milestones, such as registering a set number of cards, and can<em>&nbsp;</em>be<em>&nbsp;</em>used to buy Emblems from the Store. Emblems are just badges you can apply to your profile, and don’t really have any impact on the game. Right now, the options are Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo, so if you have enough, just use it on whatever monster is your favorite of those. There are also Special Shop Tickets which can be gathered by spending regular Shop tickets, or consuming high-rarity cards. These let you purchase Special Series cosmetics such as coins and playmats, though they aren’t too exciting.</p><hr><p>For a game about collecting cards, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>complicates this simple hobby by including an obscene amount of currencies and cosmetics that may leave you with a headache even Psyduck could’t handle. While it is a lot to take in at first, most of these currencies can only be used on a specific aspect of the game—such as hourglasses—so you don’t need to worry about spending it on the “wrong” thing. Just play the game however you want, and good luck collecting ‘em all.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Somehow, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> celebrates its tenth anniversary this week, and, to mark the occasion, developer Edmund McMillen has announced the poop-obsessed roguelike's long-awaited online co-op mode is getting its full release on 18th November.
</p>
<p>
Online co-op for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (that's the 2014 remake of McMillen's 2011 original, if you're unfamiliar), was <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">initially announced</a> in September last year. Since then, a number of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/3645131352093069363?l=english">beta sessions</a> have been held for owners of Isaac's Repentance expansion.
</p>
<p>
But now, a little over a year since online co-op was confirmed, McMillen has <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">announced</a> the mode will fully launch for everyone on 18th November. It'll support 2-4 players online, with its own completion markers, and arrives for free as part of a "considerable" balance update.

<p>
According to McMillen, this update "heavily focuses on buffing items [players] believe are lacklustre/bad." And while no additional details have been shared as yet, McMillen <em>has</em> posted some old Isaac-related design documents - including ending storyboards, boss designs, and enemy treatments - beneath his <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">social media announcement</a>.
</p><p>
But if that's still not enough to get you into the celebratory spirit for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's tenth anniversary, the game and all its expansions are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">currently discounted on Steam</a> until 11th November. There's 50 percent off the base game, and 41 percent off the Complete Bundle, which you'll need to get if you want the DLC.
</p>
<p>
As for what's next for McMillen, his long-in-the-works <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">cat-breeding roguelike adventure Mewgenics</a> (initially announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/edmund-mcmillen-details-his-upcoming-cat-lady-sim-mew-genics">all the way back in 2013</a>) is expected to arrive next year.

						<h5>Gamesir T7 Xbox Wired Controller</h5></div></div>
					<p>There are a lot of titles where the gaming experience is unparalleled with a gaming controller. Surely, there are instances where a mouse excels but the multi-tasking of a controller is what makes it stand out. Thankfully, there are plenty of controllers available to choose from and this goes for most price ranges.</p>
<p>The majority of gamers usually settle for a cheap one, which is why companies like Gamesir have introduced their brand new budget T7 Xbox wired controller. The <a href="https://www.gamesir.hk/products/gamesir-t7">Gamesir T7</a> brings an Xbox layout and a wired connection that works with several devices out of the box but is it good enough for us to recommend it?</p>
<p>We will see how it performs in various areas and review it in detail in this article. That will be followed by our verdict on the T7 Xbox wired controller which will sum up all the pros and cons of it, providing a clear picture of whether it will be suitable for your needs or not.</p>
<h2>Packaging and Contents</h2>

<h2>Gamesir T7 Summary</h2>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Gamesir T7 is a budget Xbox controller, which is compatible with multiple Xbox consoles out of the box. Moreover, it can be used with PC and Steam Deck, making it a suitable option for those who own these platforms. Since the controller is wired, connecting it to mobile phones won't be possible as it misses the Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>The T7 controller is aimed at offering all the necessary controls for playing modern games and whether it is FPS, action-adventure, RPG, or competitive titles, the T7 has all the basic controls for Xbox and PC games.</p>
<p>I liked how it looked from the outside. The white chassis with some grey and orange buttons and accents add to its aesthetics. The controller is also available in various other colors, including Sapphire Blue and Ruby Red, but the Creamsicle White is minimalistic and feels lovely sitting on the desk.</p>
<h2>Connectivity and Compatibility</h2>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Gamesir T7 can only be connected to the devices via the USB A to C cable connection. The USB C port is available on top of the controller and the cable is quite long for letting you play from a distance. While it isn't braided, it is still a high-quality and thick orange-colored cable, which you can comfortably store anywhere using the available cable tie strap.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There is a 3.5mm jack at the bottom of the controller, which can be used to connect a gaming headset. It's pretty convenient and a must-feature for controllers if you own a wired headset. Unfortunately, the more expensive <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gamesir-tarantula-pro-controller-review-solid-but-can-be-overwhelming/">Gamsir Tarantula Pro misses on this feature, which we have reviewed previously</a>.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The control layout is roughly the same as you find on regular Xbox controllers. There are four face buttons, a D-Pad, two joysticks, an Xbox home button, and a few miscellaneous buttons for various functions. Let's dive into each in the following sections.</p>
<h3>Face Buttons and D-Pad</h3>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>The face buttons are mushy and so is the D-Pad. Both use membrane switches but I found a bit different feel when pressing the two. Face buttons are pretty much how you will find on most budget controllers but the D-Pad is a bit clicky-type. The size of the D-Pad may not be large, but it's adequate.</p>
<p>The XY buttons are colored in grey while the AB buttons are orange. This contrast helps users adjust to the Xbox controller layout quickly while offering an attractive look.</p>
<h3>Joysticks And Triggers</h3>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Both joysticks and triggers use the Hall Effect mechanism for detecting the movement. Hall Effect is pretty popular in most budget controllers nowadays since there is zero drifting. With Hall Effect technology, the input is registered even in the smallest movements of buttons and joysticks as the mechanism involves magnets to measure voltage to know the distance and direction.</p>
<p>As per Gamesir, the T7 triggers are accurate up to 0.1mm. These are usually good for racing games but for genres like FPS, it would have been great if the triggers could be adjusted to hair-trigger mode. The official website does say that the triggers support both analog and hair-trigger modes, but I didn't find any button or latch to switch to the hair-trigger mode. The latter makes shooting pretty instant similar to a gaming mouse.</p>
<p>As for the joysticks, these are pretty reliable with a lifespan of up to 5 million cycles.</p>
<h2>User Experience</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Gamesir T7 is a light-weight controller and it's mostly because it doesn't use any batteries. This helps in long gaming sessions and since you don't have to worry about battery life, it's decent for PC and Xbox gaming. Still, it doesn't take away the fact that there are instances where you would have to manage that long cable and would rather want to play wirelessly.</p>
<p>There are a lot of controllers out there that bring Bluetooth connectivity for the same price as the T7. This has reduced the compatibility of T7 to just devices that bring a USB A port connection.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the controls are responsive and satisfactory. I particularly liked the D-Pad and the bumpers. They always gave a clicky feel, which was satisfying and didn't feel flimsy or low quality. Joysticks are also decent but I wouldn't say that these are the best ones. I have used some budget controllers before like EasySMX X05, which had smoother joysticks for better aiming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Gamesir-T7-14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Coming to the grip, even though the T7 has a textured grip as you can see in the image, these are very minimal. The textured grip extends all the way to the top at the back but I didn't find them significant to make a solid grip.</p>
<h2>Verdict</h2>
<p>Gamesir T7 Xbox wired controller is an all-right gaming controller for PC and Xbox users. The controls are satisfactory, the build quality is good, and the experience overall is positive. I liked the appearance and how good it looks despite featuring no RGB lighting. It would have been great if it had more buttons and some remappability but at this price, it isn't a big complaint.</p>
<p>The long and good quality cable is an additional pro for the T7, which will let you play from the couch unless you are planning to sit several meters away from your device. The Gamesir T7 isn't the best at this price but it gets the job done by offering up-to-the-mark and competitive features. However, I would prefer to go with a controller that offers both wired and wireless connectivity if my budget is $35.</p>

					
					

<p>Gamesir T7 is a satisfactory gaming controller for your daily gaming needs that works with various devices out of the box. While it doesn't have premium features, it gets the job done with its modern and responsive controls.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-naraka-bladepoint-twice-as-fast-says-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This is the week of the PS5 Pro, and you can expect lots more coverage on Sony's mid-generation console refresh. Earlier today, we published our <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unboxing</a> of the hardware; now, here's another episode of our chats with game developers who have chosen to support the new console at launch.</p>
<p>This time around, we interviewed&nbsp;Yongcheng Liu, Console Version Producer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/naraka-bladepoint-review-musou-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naraka: Bladepoint</a> at NetEase ThunderFire Universe X Studio. The free-to-play battle royale game continues to be extremely popular and just received a new gameplay mode and new hero (Cyra, a high priestess from the Temple of Light and Shadow, a support-oriented character who excels at healing teammates, controlling enemies, and dealing damage).</p>
<p>In our PS5 Pro chat, Liu said the new console runs the game twice as fast as the base PlayStation 5. The producer also reckons PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution offers similar visual quality to the current AI upscaling benchmark, NVIDIA DLSS, save for minor differences in small details. Keep scrolling below for the full Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Mode, New Cosmetics | Halloween is there!  NARAKA: BLADEPOINT" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGHrJNXB7Hc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? Which single feature were you most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The GPU upgrade is highly significant, offering approximately double the performance improvement for Naraka: Bladepoint. The most impressive features are PSSR and VRS. In particular, VRS, when applied to specific rendering processes in Naraka: Bladepoint, can drastically reduce rendering time. This is extremely important for a competitive game like Naraka.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar, reduced, or increased?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 version of Naraka: Bladepoint is our first console game, so unfortunately, we did not have the experience of transitioning from PS4 to PS4 Pro. I believe that with the next generation of console upgrades, we will have much more experience and informed insights to answer this question.</p>
<p>Due to Naraka: Bladepoint's large PC user base and our diligent efforts, we release game updates frequently, with significant content updates every 2–3 weeks. Consequently, you will consistently notice new graphical technologies and features being added to the game. For the console version, our usual approach is to optimize the performance of these updates as much as possible rather than retain everything. Therefore, Sony's recent hardware upgrade will allow us to timely integrate many of the accumulated graphical effects into the console version.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game?</strong></p>
<p>Naraka: Bladepoint can achieve 4K 60FPS on the PS5 Pro without using upscaling technologies, which is not possible on the PS5. In balanced mode, the PS5 Pro with PSSR enabled offers better visual quality compared to the PS5 using other upscaling methods while still maintaining a stable<br>
frame rate.<br>
As a live-service battle royale game, Naraka: Bladepoint places significant stress on the CPU, often resulting in CPU bottlenecks in many circumstances. Therefore, there is some FPS difference between the PS5 Pro and high-end PCs. However, we have implemented different graphical modes to provide our fans with more freedom of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share the complete details of the various PS5 Pro modes available to Naraka: Bladepoint players?</strong></p>
<p>● <strong>Quality Mode:</strong> Provides native 4K ultra-clear visuals, ideal for users seeking better visual experiences.<br>
● <strong>Balanced Mode:</strong> Enhances fluidity while maintaining 4K resolution, balancing both visual quality and smoothness.<br>
● <strong>Frame Rate Mode:</strong> Offers native 1080P visuals for users who need the highest frame rates, ensuring smoother gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? If so, how does it compare to the premiere AI-based upscaling solution, NVIDIA DLSS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Naraka: Bladepoint does use PSSR. We believe that the various upscaling technologies have<br>
had the most significant impact on game development in recent years, and we actively embrace this trend while also exploring the application of new graphics technologies.<br>
When comparing PSSR to DLSS, the overall visual performance is similar, with minor differences in some small details. For a competitive game like Naraka: Bladepoint, we strive to ensure that players do not notice these differences during regular gameplay unless the platform's performance cannot support it.</p>
<p><strong>The big controversy about Sony's new console is related to its pricing. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>From a developer's perspective, better GPUs and CPUs provide more development headroom, helping us apply new graphics technologies to our games. The high pricing could be due to various reasons, such as changes in chip prices, increased manufacturing costs, and so on. I hope these<br>
factors do not hinder players from experiencing the games they love. Therefore, we will continue to<br>
support both the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions, ensuring that every PS player who enjoys Naraka:<br>
Bladepoint can have a great experience with the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>Enshrouded has received what developers Keen Games are calling the survival game's "most sizable" update yet, sizable being an appropriate word for mountains. Expect a new playable area, the Alabaneve Summits, with its own enemies, resources, non-threatening wildlife and quests. The maximum character level has risen to 35! There are new townsfolk to find and place in your poorly built houses! You can tame animals, and make them live in poorly built houses too! You can get hypothermia!</p>
<p>All this, plus the first draft of a new dynamic weather system, with sudden snowfall draining your body heat in the new biome. It's a bountiful overhaul indeed for an early access game Ollie described as "a solid foundation" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enshrouded-early-access-review">back in January</a>, praising its "best-in-class building" while complaining about "insipid" combat, various quality-of-life issues, and a purposeful abundance of fog.

<p>And here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4461471496628338725?l=english">the full changelog</a>. Some highlights: there are new grappling hook skills that let you use it Bionic Commando-style to yank airborne foes into melee range, or reel yourself toward larger enemies. Gliding is now more challenging, with air turbulence affecting your flight path, though you can switch this off. They've also added single player pause functionality, and reworked the levelling curve so that you won't max out too early.</p><p>Possibly most enticing from my perspective as an early-game quitter is that the characters you can recruit for your homestead now behave more like people than glorified vending machines. They have a day-night cycle during which they'll explore, inspect points of interest, take breaks, talk to you and sleep at night (on the floor, if necessary). The obvious downside of this is that you might start to feel bad about their living arrangements.</p>
<p>Enshrouded will leave early access in 2025. If you'd like to know how it has evolved since January and what's left to do, the devs have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4122554066513691534?l=english">one of those roadmap things</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I can’t, and it’s important to know when to take care of others, and when to take care of myself. And when I finally make the call to do a little something for me, it often means turning off the lights, crawling into bed, throwing on some relaxing music, and powerwashing my troubles away. Let this be a balm for your soul like it has for me.</p></div><div><p>Okay, so I understand that I screamed at you all to ditch big RPGs that charge you with making huge decisions, so why not take on an even bigger one that doesn’t ask you to do any such thing?

But the great thing about <em>FFXIV</em>–and this is a staple of most MMOs if we’re being entirely honest–is how many supplementary things there are to do to immerse yourself in the world beyond the main story quest. Do you want to earn some titles and cute minions? Do literally anything else on offer, like become a master crafter, or fisher. There are multiple jobs that you can take on that have nothing to do with combat, dungeons, trials, or anything remotely like that. You can lock in to the most idle game content ever and spend your hours relaxing, casting a line, and chatting with friends in a Discord call. Take it from one of said friends who has been on that call, my friends seemed utterly blissed out, and that could (and perhaps should) be you, too.</p></div><div><p>Music is how I most often come down. The minute I pop my overpriced earphones into my head and put on my messy, uncurated playlist of liked songs, my worries wash away. Even now, I’m listening to Phoebe Bridgers and Connor Oberst’s joint record <em>Better Oblivion Community Center </em>to simultaneously listen to a record I’ve meant to throw on for some time now, put on something folk-adjacent to relax the nerves, and motivate me to write today.

The <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online </em>icon on my desktop is looking mighty tempting, and while I’ve resisted it for some time now, maybe I owe it to myself to go somewhere better. At least, until the real world begins resembling my greatest fantasies a bit more. Anything but this, y’know?<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Metro Awakening is finally here and <strong>it is looking sharp</strong>. I played a trial of Awakening on PS VR2 at Gamescom, but it was a drop in the ocean in terms of experience compared to running through the entire game on Meta Quest 3. That’s what I’ve busied myself with of late, and I’m happy to say that this is <strong>still </strong>one VR shooter that you shouldn’t miss.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Metro Awakening review, captured on Meta Quest 3.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-underground">Going Underground</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is, for want of a better term, a <strong>real Metro game</strong>. It looks, feels, and sounds like a classic Metro title, plunging players into the dank depths of the Moscow metro system, forced to survive against mutants and human enemies out for blood. It’s an entirely new perspective on the franchise – literally – but it works so well once you give it a few minutes to get settled.</p>



<p>I’ll be honest, it took me a few attempts to gel with Metro Awakening, and those attempts included playing with the game’s settings, but once I’d hit the perfect setup, I was <strong>immersed and loving every inch </strong>of Vertigo Games’ stab at this legendary post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>Metro Awakening has an all-new, original story penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, the franchise’s creator. That’s one of the most remarkable elements of this gritty VR shooter, and a few twists and turns along the way kept me thoroughly engaged, just as I would have been playing a premium, traditional release in the series, like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>As you explore this story, you’re treated to an original soundtrack composed by Anne-Kathrin Dern. It’s unmistakably <strong>Metro</strong>, and on more occasions than I could count, the soundtrack, paired with the ambient audio, was enough to send a chill through me.</p>



<p><em>Seriously, if you’ve ever played a Metro game, you’ll know how terrifying they <strong>can </strong>be. As you’re crawling through a spider-infested vent with nothing but a lighter to guide you, a ‘Lurker’ will leap around a corner, diving and scratching at your face. Imagine how intense that is through a VR headset.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-excellent-expansion">Excellent Expansion</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Metro Awakening is a prequel, and it takes players along a path that sees the protagonist, an unassuming doctor named Serdar, become one of the most supernatural entities in the Metro series: Khan. It’s set in 2028, while the first Metro game walks players through events that happen in 2033.</p>



<p>That’s where the name ‘Awakening’ comes from, see?</p>



<p>It might be a prequel set years before the first game, but it’s brilliant how familiar Awakening feels compared to the follow-up, full-sized titles. From the voice acting to the weapons, and from the post-apocalyptic environment to the mutants that stalk the tunnels of Moscow, everything is instantly recognisable as being pulled from a Metro game.</p>



<p>And it’s in these elements – the weapons, equipment, set pieces, and so on – that players will come to appreciate the depth and detail of this game. I spent so long studying the rifles and handguns I could pick up, I probed every corner looking for collectables, and I found myself hitting ‘restart’ on checkpoints just so I could try a different approach through a scene.</p>



<p>This game is focused heavily on stealth, given that Serdar is not a grizzled combat veteran, but I found myself pushing into some hardcore fights. On the easiest difficulty, you’ll still get a tasty enough challenge, and going on the toughest difficulty setting is nothing short of masochistic.</p>



<p>Within a couple of hours, you’ll have an arsenal of weapons and a full array of tactics to deploy, but like other games in the series, Awakening is relatively open-ended. I found myself accidentally ‘getting ahead of the game’ just by wondering <strong>if </strong>I could do a certain thing and then <strong>trying </strong>to do it. It doesn’t hold your hand, thankfully.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>This game isn’t without faults. I’ll sum those up before I cap off my Metro Awakening review.</p>



<ul>
<li>I had to reload checkpoint a few times because of a bug where I was either too high off the ground or too close to the floor.</li>



<li>I also had to reload the game because on three or four occasions, I stepped outside my boundary and the game locked me out of the playable area.</li>



<li>I lost a fair bit of ammunition by taking a magazine out of my weapon and setting it down on a surface that promptly swallowed it.</li>
</ul>



<p>I also <strong>had </strong>to play the game using continuous movement as opposed to teleporting, simply because I kept teleporting into surfaces that would throw my headset into disarray. It worked out for the better, though – continuous movement is superior. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Metro Awakening is worth every penny. It’s the most immersive post-apocalyptic experience I’ve had the pleasure of playing, and every step I took through the tunnels beneath Moscow had me feeling on edge and wary of my next move. I lost myself in the heart-pounding pressure of gunfights, and stealth sequences made my mouth run dry.</p>



<p>This is as close to the end of the world as you’ll ever hope to be, and the 8 – 10 hours you play fully exploring this game will be very well spent. </p>



<p><em>Metro Awakening is available worldwide on November 7 on PS VR2, Steam, Meta Quest, and Viveport.</em></p>

            <p>I've spent quite a lot of today trying to figure out why, exactly, some of the monsters in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-is-live-with-an-early-glimpse-of-the-new-camping-wound-and-weather-systems">the Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a> looked like bundles of copulating pyramids slathered in crocodile gravy. Nic clued me in on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gjfc9x/why_most_of_the_models_from_the_mhws_beta_becomes/">this reddit thread</a> earlier, which cites unnamed Chinese players who've allegedly data-mined the beta's monster models, and learned that they are extremely large, encompassing hundreds of thousands of polygons.</p>
<p>If every monster in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> were that fancy all of the time, your computer would become a volcano. As such, the game resorts to loading-on-demand systems to ensure that you only see those gorgeous details when the monsters are close by and, as the case may be, angrily sitting on you. When they're further afield, the flourishes fall away to free up memory and processing power. The popular Redditor explanation for the presence of monsters that look like Henry Moore sculpture is basically that the LOD systems are being forgetful, and neglecting to load the additional polygons at proximity.</p> <!--more-->
<p>All this comes with the severe caveat that we are talking about somebody's patchy translation of amateur tech breakdowns that may have been totally fabricated. Capcom ain't talking either. But the explanation is consistent with what I dimly understand of memory management in other video games. More importantly, the low poly monsters are just extremely good fun.</p>
<p>It isn't particularly novel to argue that Actually, video games are more visually intriguing when you boil away a lot of detail and geometry. I did <a gref="https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-thankless-quietly-imaginative-task-of-developing-for-low-spec-gaming/">a feature about low-spec graphics for PCGamer</a> back in the day, and have also written in glowing terms about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-power-of-demakes-in-the-year-of-next-gen">PS1 demakes of triple-A games</a>, together with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">arsey reverse-historical commentaries on Silent Hill 2</a>. So I won't belabour the point this time. Fortunately, I have other people to belabour it for me.</p><p>The beta's jigsaw-dinosaurs have sparked a wave of enthusiasm on Twitter, one of those little trends that makes you think ah, maybe Twitter ain't so bad these days, and then you spend longer than five minutes there, and nope, still awful. In amongst <a href="https://x.com/Zugsie/status/1852222041040060501">the complaints about optimisation</a>, there are people attempting half-serious taxonomies of the low-poly menagerie.</p>

<p>Studying these low-poly models is a useful exercise for armchair developers like myself, inasmuch as it reveals which parts of the base monster's appearance the Wilds artists consider essential, in order for you to perceive it as a monster at all  - shape, colour, anatomy, texture, et cetera. All told, I wonder if they'd consider doubling down on the LOD glitch and making it a proper feature, perhaps with some directorial commentary. But above all, I need to know how exactly you make yourself some juicy leather pauldrons from a Chatacabra that looks like a haunted box of tissue paper.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is not only one of the most popular casual shooter games, but it thrives in the world of competitive and ranked, too. With Black Ops 6 just released, many are waiting for the game’s ranked system to drop. However, all Call of Duty games over the last few years have kept the same ranked system. Here are all the Call of Duty ranks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-call-of-duty-rank">Every Call of Duty Rank</h2>



<p>Call of Duty still stands as one of the biggest games in the world of esports and gaming, with millions of players hopping on every day. However, just because the game is incredibly popular amongst casual gamers, there is a massive competitive scene too.</p>



<p>So, here is a list of every rank in Call of Duty (updated last in Modern Warfare 3):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze (I – III):</strong> 0-899 SR</li>



<li><strong>Silver (I – III):</strong> 900-2,099 SR</li>



<li><strong>Gold (I – III):</strong> 2,100-3,599 SR</li>



<li><strong>Platinum (I – III):</strong> 3,600-5,399 SR</li>



<li><strong>Diamond (I – III):</strong> 5,400-7,499 SR</li>



<li><strong>Crimson (I – III):</strong> 7,500-9,999 SR</li>



<li><strong>Iridescent:</strong> 10,000 SR</li>



<li><strong>Top 250:</strong> 10,000+ SR</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s ranked system runs off of Skill Rating (SR), which is Call of Duty’s in-game points used to rank up. Players rank up by getting kills and wins when playing ranked. </p>



<p>If the ranked system changes for Black Ops 6, we will update you here at Insider Gaming.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-top-250-in-call-of-duty">How to get Top 250 in Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s final rank, Top 250, is quite unique compared to other games. While every game has a final rank that players strive for, no other game has a rank that specifies you are in a certain top portion of players. </p>



<p>Being able to brag that you have made it into the Top 250 in Call of Duty is an incredibly impressive feat, as literally, <em>only </em>250 people will be able to make this claim. Still, unlike other final ranks in games, your spot in the Top 250 could be lost depending on how many others are working to get there. </p>



<p>To stay in the Top 250 you will have to consistently play ranked and work to not lose your spot. Those who make it into the Top 250 will be shown on a leaderboard for everyone to see, giving them the ultimate bragging rights.</p>



<p>Are you planning on trying to get into the Top 250 in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>

They'll need to earn special items called Fallen Citadel Gates in order to travel to Arthas' frozen throne. These can be earned by completing dungeons, acquired as log-in rewards, or acquired as a rare drop from monsters killed over the course of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting the Lich King isn't all there is to the event. Players will be able to earn new weapon cosmetics modeled off some of WoW's own legendary weapons by progressing through an event pass, including Thunderfury, Shadowmourne, Gorehowl, and Atiesh. Those who didn't earn the Frostmourne skin from a previous WoW-themed event will be able to do so during this time around as well.</p><p dir="ltr">A new PvP battleground, Cutthroat Basin, will also make its debut on November 13. The map is modeled off WoW's Arathi Basin battleground, complete with capture points like the lumber mill, blacksmith, and stables. Players' levels, items, and gems will be normalized for the PvP event to make things fair, and players will additionally be able to seek out special skill orbs during the battle that will grant access to WoW abilities like Blessing of Kings, Stealth, Eagle Eye, and Blink.</p><p dir="ltr">There are other cosmetics too, though some of them won't be for free. Murloc skins for Diablo Immortal's familiar pets can be earned for free, but Illidan-themed wings and cosmetics can only be earned through the gacha-style Phantom Market, of which players will get one roll for free for logging in during the event. Two versions of WoW's iconic Ashbringer sword will be available for purchase from the in-game shop for the duration of the event, with no free way to earn the legendary Paladin weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there is one cosmetic for WoW players that can be earned during the event: a Treasure Nabbin' Bag back cosmetic. To claim it, players who play WoW and Diablo Immortal with the same Battle.net account simply need to log in to Diablo Immortal with a character level 10 or above to earn the Treasure Bag in WoW.

The company quietly listed the $60 gamepad <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-HORIPAD-Steam-Midnight-Black-Deck/dp/B0DLLKRFG8/?tag=theverge02-20">for preorder on Amazon</a>, with availability starting December 16th.</p></div><p>Hori originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186645/valve-steam-controller-officially-licensed-wireless-horipad-announcement-specs">released its Wireless Horipad for Steam in October</a> — but only in Japan. The controller features dedicated buttons you can use to pull up menus in Steam, whether you’re playing in Big Picture Mode, or on the company’s handheld. Just like on the Steam Deck, the gamepad comes with touch sensors on its joysticks for motion controls and mappable back buttons.</p><p>The controller can connect to your computer or Steam Deck with Bluetooth or the included USB-A Bluetooth receiver. Hori says the wireless gamepad will last up to 12 hours on a full charge, but you can plug in its USB cable in case it runs out of juice in the middle of your game. Additionally, you can remap buttons and adjust the gamepad’s stick sensitivity, gyro controls, and turbo settings from the controller menu in Steam.</p><p>Hori’s controller lacks a few features you might expect to see on a Steam-specific controller, though, including rumble packs, a headset jack, and a trackpad. Still, it seems like a decent choice if you want a controller that’s sort of like an extension of your Steam Deck. It’s just too bad Valve hasn’t revived the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future">ultra-customizable Steam controller</a> it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price">discontinued in 2019</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For some who forked over nearly $100, for the fanciest version that provided the earliest access, the game was basically unplayable due to server issues for days. Other players shared videos of physics and graphical bugs. In other words, <em>Solar Crown’</em>s launch was a big mess, and now, for those early players, the developers are offering a free (digital) Porsche as an apology, alongside a large update. </p><p>On November 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/4505380324428942357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Test Drive</em> publisher Nacon and developer KT Racing posted an update to Steam</a></span> thanking players for their “patience and support.” And to help win people back, those who logged into <em>Solar Crown </em>before October 12 will automatically receive the “Adventurer” edition of the 1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe after Season 2 launches. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nacon and KT Racing announced that on Tuesday the second major patch for <em>TDU Solar Crown </em>will be available on all platforms. This patch is focused on improving stability and performance on Xbox, PS5, and PC. The patch also promises to fix many of the server login issues players have been encountering since September. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, we’ve worked hard to roll out multiple maintenance phases and hotfixes aimed at enhancing the game,” explained Nacon. “We know there’s still work to be done, and we hear you. Please know that your feedback is invaluable, and our development team is fully dedicated to addressing the issues you’re encountering as quickly as possible, while also refining features to ensure a smoother, more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone.”<br></p><p>Will a free car and the promise of more fixes be enough to win players over? I’m not sure. So far, the game’s Steam review rating is still standing at Mostly Negative. So there’s still a lot of work to be done if Nacon and KT Racing want to turn this car around.</p><hr><p>Here are the full patch notes for <em>Test Drive Unlimted Solar Crown’</em>s new major update:</p><h2 id="h84755"><a id=""></a>Servers/Network</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed various login issues</li></ul><h2 id="h84756"><a id=""></a>Performance/Stability</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Reduced shadow cost in performance<br></li><li>Added various optimizations to improve memory consumption and overall stability<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when entering a spot<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen when traffic spawned<br></li><li>Fixed a crash that could happen while buying car parts<br></li><li>PC: Fixed a crash that could occur when playing with certain AMD GPUs<br></li><li>PS5: Reduced frame drops in performance mode<br></li></ul><h2 id="h84757"><a id=""></a>Graphics</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Improved global illumination performance<br></li><li>Improved octree tracing performance<br></li><li>Improved shadow quality created by headlights<br></li><li>Improved SSR upscaling<br></li><li>PC: Use DLAA instead of FSR TAA by default when available<br></li><li>PS5: Improved quality mode resolution from 1080p to 1440p<br></li></ul><h2 id="h84758"><a id=""></a>Compatibility</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>PC: Fixed binding and default preset on Thrustmaster TMX wheel<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Logitech G923 default binding<br></li><li>PC: Fixed Moza devices default preset<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB was lost when the mouse was moved<br></li><li>PC: Fixed issue where FFB could still be present when navigating menus<br></li><li>PS5 &amp;

<p>Halloween is over, and Christmas is just around the corner. With Black Friday giving gamers quite a few options of titles to buy for the Holiday season, which games are the best to play for Christmas fans?</p>



<p>Here are the best Christmas video games to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-christmas-games-to-play">Best Christmas Games to Play</h2>



<p>Looking for the best Christmas games to play? Luckily, there are quite a few. However, many of these games are not necessarily Christmas-themed from the get-go. Many popular titles have Holiday updates during the season, giving gamers a break from the usual worlds they love to explore. </p>



<p>So, which video games are the best for players to jump into during Christmas?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been a leader in Christmas updates. The game adds quite a few new changes to its maps that go alongside the Holiday season. A personal favorite is the Christmas lights that can be seen hung up throughout different maps.</p>



<p>The game has many other additions, though, including new game modes and more. Last year during the Modern Warfare III Christmas update, we saw a mode called “Snowfight” introduced, which allowed players to kill each other using snowballs.</p>



<p>Sounds like a blast, right? With Christmas-themed rewards and more, the Call of Duty Christmas update is a must for gamers to play and will be introduced once again this December.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fortnite">Fortnite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite is another game that always has an update to go along with whatever big Holiday is around the corner. With Fortnitemares, the game’s Halloween update, just ending, gamers are preparing for a unique Christmas update. </p>



<p>The game even has a “12-days-of-Christmas” event, where players can head to a log cabin where a plethora of presents will be sitting around an open fire. Every day you open up the game during the event, you will be able to open up one present. These gifts range from skins to gliders to weapon wraps and more. </p>



<p>The game usually adds quite a few Christmas-themed features onto the map, too. Snow will cover a large portion of the island, giving players the proper Christmas feel.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-go">Pokemon GO</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Expect to see Pokemon GO on this list? While many have thought to believe this game is dead, the popular mobile game by Niantic is still thriving and even has a Christmas update. </p>



<p>So, what’s all included in the Holiday update? Well, last year, during the Pokemon GO Christmas event, there plenty of players playing the video game were able to capture new Pokemon that had yet to be introduced to the game. There are still a few hundred names that have yet to join the game, so we could easily see more added during Christmas this year.</p>



<p>But new Pokemon is not the only feature that comes with the game’s Christmas update. Many new variations of Pokemon will begin to appear, all wearing Christmas or Holiday-themed clothing. For instance, in the past, Pikachu wearing a Santa hat could be seen and catchable throughout the streets.</p>



<p>The game also features special raids, rewards and more during the Christmas season, so get prepared.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Want a break from shooters or walking around your city in the cold trying to catch Pokemon? Well, the popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft, has a yearly Christmas event called “The Feast of Winter Veil.”</p>



<p>This event has been happening for years now and is a staple within the Warcraft community. It will even translate over to Hearthstone and other WoW-themed titles.</p>



<p>Players who jump in during the season will get various rewards from gifts under the tree. There will even be reindeer seen that players can attempt to free. </p>



<p>Not only that but there will be plenty of rewards and items to collect, including Christmas-themed cosmetics and more. And yes, you can even pick up snow and throw it as snowballs. </p>



<p>World of Warcraft is by far one of the best Christmas games to play, if you want to pay for the monthly subscription, that is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-will-you-be-playing">What Will You Be Playing?</h2>



<p>With Christmas just around the corner, what game will you be playing? Will you hop in a shooter like Black Ops 6 or Fortnite? Or will you be looking to grab a bit of exercise, roaming the streets hunting for different Pokemon? </p>



<p>Or will you and some friends be jumping into World of Warcraft, completing raids and gaining as many Christmas-themed cosmetics as possible? The possibilities are endless this winter, so enjoy the Holiday season.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall-31.1028112/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lowers-annual-forecast-after-switch-sales-fall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo modified its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025 after Switch hardware and software sales dropped significantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">financial report</a>, Nintendo’s net sales decreased by 34.3% for the first half of the fiscal year. Operating profit dropped by 56.6%, ordinary profit decreased by 61%, and profit attributable to parent company owners decreased by 59.9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s dedicated video game platform sales dropped by 34.1 per cent year over year, and “a decline in unit sales for both Nintendo Switch hardware and software” was attributed as the cause for this fall. Mobile and IP-related businesses also saw sales decrease by 43% year over year, as income from visual content related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie decreased.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s gross profit declined 32.6% year-on-year. However, the gross profit margin increased by “1.5 percentage points year-on-year to 60.8%.” Additionally, SG&amp;A expenses increased by 2.2% year-on-year, and the ratio of SG&amp;A expenses to sales increased by 13.4 percentage points to 37.5% year-on-year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the fall, Nintendo has decided to revise its financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2025. The new estimates are 1,280.0 billion yen in net sales and 360.0 billion yen in operating profit. The ordinary and net profit forecast will not change, staying at 420.0 billion yen and 300.0 billion yen, respectively. Hence, the forecasted annual dividend will remain at 129 yen per share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo has also modified the unit sales forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware and software. The forecasted unit sales for Switch hardware have been decreased by 1 million units and software by 5 million units, with the new numbers being 12.50 million and 160.00 million units, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-sells-over-146-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 146 million units</a>. However, it suffered from a 31.0% drop year-on-year in hardware (4.72 million units) and a 27.6% drop year-on-year in software (70.28 million units). Also, Nintendo stated that the plan for Switch 2’s announcement before April 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. What are your thoughts on Nintendo lowering its annual forecast?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has a ton of cards to collect from common collectibles to Ultra-Rare, Full art designs. Opening packs is one of the main ways to pull cards, and a long-standing rumor suggests certain boosters—”Bent Packs”—give you better luck.</p>



<p>It’s hard to quantify how much money I’ve spent on real-life Pokémon packs at this point. The buzz of opening a pack and not knowing what’s inside never gets old. Pokémon TCG Pocket digitizes the age-old hobby and converts the TCG into an easy-to-digest mobile phone format.</p>



<p>You still get to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open Pokémon packs</a> and experience the unbridled disappointment when you get a duplicate for the ninth time. A certain Bent Pack suggests you can boost your odds of getting super-rare cards from packs. Let’s see what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p>The Corner Pack Trick—otherwise known as the Bent Pack—in Pokémon TCG Pocket, is looking through the carousel of packs, and when you come to make your choice, <strong>you turn the pack to its side</strong> and identify a certain shape of pack <strong>noticeably bent in one (if not both) of the corners.</strong></p>



<p>To be honest, I don’t where this theory started, I don’t know who came up with it, but it’s pretty cool nonetheless. I use my own superstitions when opening packs from spinning the packs around in a full circle to opening the pack from the right-hand side instead of the left side.</p>



<p>But if you look closely at the carousel and thoroughly investigate each pack, I can confirm you can see one of these bent packs from time to time. But does it actually mean anything?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-corner-pack-trick-work-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Does the Corner Pack Trick work in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>No science or logic proves the bent pack works in Pokémon TCG Pocket</strong>, and after checking this out myself, I would conclusively say the <strong>corner pack is nothing but a myth</strong>—albeit a fun one to distract yourself!</p>



<p>Firstly, if you go onto the packs section of Pokémon TCG Pocket, the game has a button in the bottom-left corner saying “Offering Rates.” This is in line with <strong>regulations concerning loot boxes and gambling</strong> to protect you, and let you know the odds of getting each card, the rarity of a pack, and what you can pull—especially if you’re spending real money.</p>



<p>A bent pack might sound cool on paper, but it would be deceitful; players in the know would automatically gain an advantage over other players, and it would be a legal issue. Furthermore, I’ve tried these corner-trick packs, and there’s no obvious difference between them and opening a regular pack.</p>

<p>If you need a fresh way of opening packs, knock yourself out and hoard all the bent packs you can get your hands on.</p>

This year's N7 Day - the annual celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> held on 7th November - will be a "quieter" one than usual, developer BioWare has said. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on X, BioWare has told fans that N7 Day 2024 will still host "a little fun", but its attention was currently still focused on last week's big launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. 
</p>
<p>
Past years have seen BioWare release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">trailer</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">concept art</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">audio snippets</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">logos</a> for the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> - now the studio's next project.

Details of Mass Effect 5 remain thin on the ground, though we know it will see a return to the series' home turf of the Milky Way galaxy, and pick up the action several hundred years after the conclusion of the original trilogy.
