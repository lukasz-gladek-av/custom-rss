		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>‘s release, Bloober Team have revealed their next horror game, Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025, Cronos: The New Dawn is a third person survival horror game that will drop you into a dark and twisted time travel story, filled with Eastern European brutalism.</p>
<p>Here’s some of the explanation and blurb from Steam:</p>
<p><em>Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future.</em></p>

<p><em>In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>You are a Traveler acting as an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport you back to 1980s-era Poland.</em></p>
<p><em>Your mission is to locate key people from the past who perished in the ensuing apocalypse. Using your all-powerful Harvester, you can extract their Essences and have them accompany you into the future.</em></p>
<p><em>In a desolate world filled with ever-present danger, your survival hinges on your ability to strategize and plan ahead. The enemies you’ll encounter are nightmarish creatures, born from the remnants of humanity – defeating them will require you to make full use of your arsenal. During battle, quick decisions can mean the difference between life and death.</em></p>
<p>Most intriguing, I think you’ll agree!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the name of the next game by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> developer Bloober Team, launching sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The game was revealed with a cinematic trailer shown during today's<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF6rXas66ns"> Xbox Partner Preview showcase</a>, which gives off some serious Dead Space vibes. The game will be a survival horror game featuring a time travel story set in a post-apocalyptic future in 1980s Poland.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sp5X_7OGoBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>"Following the success of Silent Hill 2, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from Bloober Team,” </em>said Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno<em>. “Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio’s strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience.</em></p>
<p>Developing the Silent Hill 2 remake definitely did a lot of good for Bloober Team, as Cronos: The New Dawn looks very different from the narrative-driven experiences the team has released to date. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to experience this time-traveling story, as the game will launch sometime in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-new-trailer-confirms-october-22nd-release-date.1012551/</guid>

			<p>A new Alan Wake 2 The Lake House DLC expansion trailer was shared online today, providing the first proper look at the second expansion of one of the best survival horror games released in the past few years.</p>
<p>The new trailer, shown during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF6rXas66ns">Xbox Partner Preview </a>showcase, confirms that the tone of the new expansion is more in line with that of the base game, as opposed to that of the light-hearted first expansion, Night Springs. The trailer also confirmed that the expansion will launch, as previously rumored, on October 22nd on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2: The Lake House - Launch Trailer | Xbox Partner Preview October 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/591RFRnhNEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Lake House's tone being more in line with that of the base game is most definitely welcome, although I enjoyed how the Night Springs expansion twisted the vast majority of Alan Wake 2's narrative elements to offer something markedly different. You can learn more about the expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its three entertaining scenarios showcasing Remedy Entertainment's narrative and visual design prowess, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a more than worthy DLC for all fans of the base game and the Finnish developer, provided they can keep their expectations in check. The expansion's short length, a little over two and a half hours, and its stripped-down gameplay will inevitably disappoint those looking for something more substantial</em></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is now available on PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The Lake House expansion will launch on October 22nd as part of the game's Expansion Pass.</p>

And now, hot off that big blockbuster, Bloober Team has a new spooky game in the works that was just revealed at Xbox’s event. </p><p>Here’s the debut trailer for<em> Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, which might be one of the most video game-y names I’ve seen in some time. </p><p>The trailer shows a person in a creepy armored space suit exploring a dark world filled with nasty monsters who don’t seem very friendly. The trailer also features that same space suit-clad explorer playing a game of chess with an old woman. Eventually, the space-suited player wins and then gets up and seemingly kills the old lady with a wild-looking mechanical claw that pops out of his arm, while his victim seems resigned to her fate.</p><p>Here’s how Bloober Team describes<em> Cronos: The New Dawn</em> on YouTube:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Delve deep into the heart of a deadly struggle against overwhelming foes with combat-driven gameplay, all while uncovering the mysteries of a twisted time travel story.</p></blockquote><p>So what’s actually going on here? No idea. But I’m getting big <em>Dead Space,</em> <em>Death Stranding</em>, and even some <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake vibes from the snippets of gameplay we get to see in the trailer, and I’m excited. Let’s hope Bloober Team’s recent hot streak continues when <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> arrives in 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Online reactions to the reveal of <em>Project Ethos</em> haven’t been any better. It’s mostly been a mix of people joking about that it will share the fate of&nbsp;Sony’s short-lived hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, comparing <em>Project Ethos</em> negatively to<em> Fortnite</em> and <em>Overwatch</em>, or commenting on how it feels like we’ve gotten so many of these colorful free shooters in the last few years and none of them have made much of a splash. Perhaps <em>Project Ethos </em>will be different? I bet 2K is hoping so.</p><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ethos.2k.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ethos.2k.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Project Ethos</em>’ first public playtest</a></span> will start on October 17 and run to October 20. You can join by getting a key from watching <em>Ethos </em>streams on Twitch. 2K says players can sign up for future chances at later tests. The game is set to arrive on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC sometime in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the studio’s immense success with Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero, it was only a matter of time before developer Unkown Worlds Entertainment went all in with a sequel. Well, it’s finally happening. At Xbox Partner Preview, the indie studio unveiled Subnautica 2, with an Early Access release window of 2025.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the reveal trailer doesn’t offer any gameplay. It does offer a unique cinematic look at the underwater world, a few different creatures, some of which long-time fans will immediately recognize, along with two new characters—a man and woman—as they deal with a massive Kraken-like creature rising from the depths!</p>

<p>Hot off the heels of its success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, developer Bloober Team impressed us again during the Xbox Partner Preview in October with Cronos: The New Dawn. Their upcoming title features a spacesuit-clad mystery hero wandering through a gravity-defying abandoned building until he’s unceremoniously attacked by crawling creatures with human-like faces.</p>



<p>The upcoming horror game, Cronos, launches sometime in 2025, exclusively on PC and Xbox Series X|S. You can check out the reveal trailer from the latest showcase here:</p>

<p>While I love a more action-oriented horror game, the immersive environment, character and monster design, and the lighting in the cinematic point toward a memorable horror experience! </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Black Ops Story So Far Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Players who already have Call of Duty installed will receive the Black Ops 6 preload as an automatic update to their existing install, which is similar to previous Call of Duty updates. Activision warns that the download will be larger for these players, as they're getting the new UI and Black Ops 6 at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who preordered Black Ops 6 but doesn't already have Call of Duty installed can initiate the preload from their platform storefront. This download will not include Warzone bundled with Black Ops 6. Warzone is now a separate and optional download.</p><p dir="ltr">Once this download is completed, players can check out the new UI immediately in MW3 and Warzone. They'll also be ready to play Black Ops 6 as soon as it is released. More information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-launch-times-detailed/1100-6527163/">Black Ops 6 launch times can be found here</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_manage_storage_space">How to manage storage space</h2><p dir="ltr">With Black Ops 6's arrival, Call of Duty will take up more space on devices if a player chooses to keep all of their previous content installed, as a new game is being added on top of those existing files.</p><p dir="ltr">However, players can uninstall content within the Call of Duty user-interface or via their platform's install manager. After content is removed, it can still be reinstalled at a later time.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says PlayStation 5 players who don't purchase Black Ops 6 will still download Black Ops 6 multiplayer and Zombies as part of their Call of Duty install. This optimizes the Black Ops 6 download experience for PlayStation 5’s content-delivery system. Players can then choose to uninstall multiplayer and Zombies after their initial install, or keep them for easy access to free trial weekends or for a future Black Ops 6 purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation 4 players who don't purchase Black Ops 6 will still download some content that is shared between Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. The publisher says this facilitates "content optimizations that benefit all players on PlayStation 4," so unlike PS5 consoles, it doesn't appear that these files can be deleted from PS4.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386161-bo6-codhq-ui-image-tout2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386161" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386161-bo6-codhq-ui-image-tout2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386161"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's new Home tab</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386161-bo6-codhq-ui-image-tout2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_navigate_the_new_UI">How to navigate the new UI</h2><p dir="ltr">At launch, Call of Duty's new interface will include three main hubs: Home, All Games, and Store. Each hub displays all of its content on one page, eliminating the need to scroll. The redesigned Home tab can be seen in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">The Home tab will include only the current Call of Duty title and Warzone. This is also where players will find the featured content, a "What's Hot" list for popular playlists and bundles, as well as a section that shows the player's most recently played playlists.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's launch will move Modern Warfare 3 and Modern Warfare 2 to the "All Games" hub. This will include a player's full Call of Duty library, dating all the way back to Modern Warfare 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">The Store hub will send players to the full Call of Duty in-game stores that will be accessible at the game-level of the UI within Black Ops 6, Warzone, and other titles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386168-bo6-codhq-ui-image-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386168" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386168-bo6-codhq-ui-image-0022.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386168"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's new All Games tab</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4386168-bo6-codhq-ui-image-0022.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Continued_UI_evolution">Continued UI evolution</h2><p dir="ltr">While the initial download should provide a more streamlined and easier-to-navigate user-interface, Call of Duty's UI will continue to evolve over three initial phases, which the publisher says should "reach its full capabilities with the start of Season 1."</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 1 leaves Modern Warfare 3 on the Home tab until Black Ops 6's launch. Players will also still be directed to the MW3 in-game store from the Store tab.</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 2 moves Black Ops 6 to the forefront of the Home Store hubs, but the Store hub will direct players based on their game installs. Meaning players will only be directed to Black Ops 6 if they have the game downloaded.</p><p dir="ltr">Phase 3 will start directing all players to the Black Ops 6 store, and this update marks the Season 1 update with Warzone integration.

                <p>The upcoming second <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a> expansion, The Lake House, will introduce new monsters, a new playable character, and new weapons, according to glimpses seen in today's trailer from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-5861/" data-ref-id="2900-5861">Xbox Partner Preview</a>. However, it's also doing something that looks back in a sense, while still looking ahead to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">future Remedy projects</a>. The Lake House will tie in closely to Control, Remedy's 2019 game, as well as its sequel, which is coming out sometime in the future.</p><p>In the new trailer, you'll see players now take on the role of Agent Estevez, a Federal Bureau of Control agent who was seen quite a bit in the Alan Wake 2 story, but only now will she be playable for the first time. Her story centers on the mysterious and locked-away Lake House from the base game, which was said to have been a place of turmoil due to events that we don't get to see in the story of Alan Wake 2... until now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=591RFRnhNEY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/591RFRnhNEY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What's maybe most interesting here, however, is how Dylan Faden, the brother of Control's protagonist Jesse Faden, is hinted at. Is Dylan in the Lake House? Is he astrally projecting into it--or perhaps into Estevez's mind? It's clear Remedy is comfortable getting very weird with its expansions.</p><p>Eager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/" data-ref-id="2900-4952">Remedy Connected Universe</a> nerds (non-derogatory) can play The Lake House when it hits Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC next week on October 22. It comes included in the game's Deluxe Edition, or can be purchased in the Deluxe Edition upgrade for those who already own the base game but want to play the expansions.</p>

            <p>For those looking forward to heading back into the rather surreal and twisted world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, you will soon be able to do just that, thanks to the imminent arrival of its Lake House DLC.</p>
<p>During this evening's Xbox Partner Preview Event, developer Remedy shared a brief teaser for the game's upcoming DLC, which takes place in a mysterious facility situated on the shores of Cauldron Lake.</p>
<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/17/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-xbox-partner-preview/">blog post</a>, the team went into further detail about the expansion, which will pop players into the shoes of FBC Agent Estevez, for what Remedy calls a "true survival horror" experience for all. This will include plenty of scares and overall peril, and Remedy has likened the horror levels in this DLC to those in Alan Wake 2's Valhalla Nursing Home sequence.</p>

<p>This horror will include a new enemy type known as the Painted. "For The Lake House we wanted to introduce a new, different kind of enemy from those found in the main game," explained Remedy's Kyle Rowley. </p>
<p>
"It's important to us that our enemies follow on from themes found in and around the part of the game that they are revealed - whether that be the water-themed enemy, the 'Diver' located at the Valhalla Nursing Home, or the Taken Wolves that are found in and around the Cauldron Lake Forest.</p><p>"With that in mind, the Painted are very much themed around one of the core elements inside the Lake House - paint! They can move in and out of the supernatural paint on surfaces, hunting the player as they do so and have devastating melee attacks that deal significant amounts of damage."</p>

<p>Lead Writer Clay Murphy noted "the Lake House tells the story of Agent Estevez’s visit to the Lake House facility, which takes place in parallel with the early part of [Alan Wake 2 co-protagonist] Saga’s story in Alan Wake 2". This means by the time Saga meets Estevez in the main game, "the story of this expansion has already occurred".</p>
<p>The DLC will have connections with Remedy's Control, as well as Alan Wake 2. "Control explores horror themes as well of course,” furthered Rowley, "but with Alan Wake 2 being a survival horror game we just felt that the world of Control provides some rather harrowing elements for us to lean into and scare players with".</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC will release in just a few days time, on 22nd October.</p>

            <p>Bloober has announced its next game will be an original sci-fi survival horror called Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p>Though revealed during today's Xbox Partner Preview, the game is set for release across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in 2025.</p>
<p>The game will follow the studio's recent success with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, published by Konami.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn will feature time travel in a story incorporating a post-apocalyptic future and 1980s Poland.</p>
<p>As a Traveler, players will explore and survive a deadly wasteland created by a cataclysmic event known as the Change - of course, it's filled with "monstrous abominations".</p>
<p>"Following the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, we are proud to present Cronos, an exciting new IP from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>," said Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team. "Our commitment to redefining the horror genre continues with this survival horror title, which represents a natural progression of our creative vision and our studio's strategy. By merging the eerie atmosphere of horror with the boundless potential of science fiction, Cronos promises to deliver a fresh survival experience. We can't wait to share it with the world in 2025."</p>
<p>Ahead of Silent Hill 2's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-ceo-dreaming-that-gamers-will-trust-us-to-deliver-silent-hill-2-remake">Babieno called for fans to trust the studio</a>, despite concern over the quality of its previous work.</p>
<p>"I am dreaming that gamers will trust us," he said, "but I realise that trust is earned through actions, not through words. So that's why we have a policy of not commenting [on the specifics of the game] and raising hopes. We want to show our ambitions through our work, so we can't ask for anything more than 'give us a chance'."</p>
<p>Earlier today, Konami announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 had passed a million sales in under a week</a> - surely Bloober's most prominent success to date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-release-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dbrand-launches-%E2%80%98darkplates-2-0%E2%80%99-for-ps5-and-says-%E2%80%98checkmate-lawyers%E2%80%99.1012413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-release-ps5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2021, Sony shut down the production of dbrand’s ‘Darkplates’, bespoke side plates to replace the stock covering provided with the PlayStation 5. They were sleek, they were edgy, and they proved to be too much for Sony to handle, and the tech titan served up a lawsuit on a silver platter.</p>



<p>Now, three years later, dbrand is back with Darkplates 2.0, a second stab that’s a prolific punch in the gut to Sony’s lawyers. There are now more than 100,000 users sitting in a queue to pick up the PS5 Darkplates – and the first wave of them is available <strong>today</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dark-innovations">Dark Innovations</h2>



<p>The Darkplates 2.0 are available for the original PlayStation 5 <strong>and </strong>the Slim models, spanning both the digital and disc editions of the console. Dbrand has made sure to produce something both functional and stunning, creating a black-on-black design with increased airflow, fewer parts, and better materials.</p>



<p>Alongside the Darkplates 2.0 innovation sits the Lightstrips, a series of custom LED strips that slip between the PS5’s core body and the Darkplates 2.0, offering a brighter, bolder alternative to the stock lighting solution.</p>



<p>In a par-for-the-course style of spiel, dbrand held nothing back while marketing the Darkplates 2.0 case:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Imagine this: you’re a ¥15,000,000,000,000 enterprise who just spent a small fortune designing their next-generation gaming console. A privately held corporation run by robots makes it black. The world rejoices. You’re livid. You vent your frustrations to a team of lawyers. They get to work. Now, under threat of litigation, those robots have to redesign their Darkplates… while also funding a legal defense. Needless to say, some corners were cut. You’re welcome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team event went above and beyond to revolutionise the packaging of the Darkplates 2.0 case. Per a comment on the dbrand website, the crew ‘sent (their) Box Scientists to Mars.’ If you’re like me and you’re a bit of a packaging nerd, that’s sure to excite you.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The release of Darkplates 2.0 will be staggered across four waves, the first of which is preparing to ship now. Follow-up waves will run from November to January, so get your hands on them while you can.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Dbrand also took the flimsy plastic pegs that are used to stand up a PS5 console and pieced together an all-new stand. It’s a magnetic base unit that’s super sturdy and robust, giving you better peace of mind when laying your console horizontally. In dbrand’s words, it’s a step up from ‘a pair of plastic peglegs that could be snapped in half by a toddler.’</p>



<p>If you jump onto the dbrand site, you can <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/ps5#options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">order your Darkplates 2.0</a>, bolt on a lush middle skin and some Lightstrips, and if you want, throw on a stand. The whole bundle should run you less than $100.</p>



<p>Are you going to snap up a set of Darkplates 2.0? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Today, 2K announced Project ETHOS, a new third-person hero shooter in development at 31st Union, Michael Condrey's studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> four years ago in the Silicon Valley area.</p>
<p>Project ETHOS will be a free-to-play game, and it will integrate roguelike elements. Players will be able to shape their play style each match through Evolutions, powerful, semi-randomized upgrades that are unique to each Hero. With Evolutions, it is possible to transform a sniper into a melee skirmisher or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. The roguelike elements mean that in each run, players take on the competition with new abilities, stakes and challenges that change each match. There's a risk-versus-reward element where they can play it safe with their hard-earned cores, or go for broke, risk it all and see if they can take the top spot.&nbsp;The game will include an Extraction mode called Trials, which was described as&nbsp;an ongoing, persistent battle to collect cores, extract, and unlock powerful augments to fuel future Trials runs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K and developer 31st Union are throwing their hats into the trendy game ring with&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, a roguelike hero shooter with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay.</p>
<p>There isn't much information available about the game right now; its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139090/Project_ETHOS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam page</a> describes it as a "free-to-play third-person roguelike hero shooter" that's currently in development, and there's not much more info besides that.</p>
<p>However, a few screenshots have been released alongside said Steam page, and they show a game that looks an awful lot like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, all smoothed-over character designs and pseudo-cartoony visuals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter-powerups.jpg?itok=U6OdfsiR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter-powerups.jpg?itok=58rp2InM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Decisions, decisions.</figcaption></figure><p>According to an early <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN preview</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>is also an extraction shooter, with its main gameplay mode apparently taking after the likes of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare&nbsp;</em>to some degree.</p>
<p>Given how early the game is in development, it's not entirely encouraging that IGN's previewer ends their time with the game by saying that it "fails at being a new experience that players will crave...over and over again".</p>
<p>Other gameplay modes in&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>are described as "cookie-cutter and unexciting", and honestly, the character designs in the game are already giving me&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>vibes, which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">the fate of that game</a>, probably isn't what 2K wants to hear.</p>
<p>I don't want to be pessimistic about&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>before it's even seen the light of day (and, of course, before I've even played it), but what 2K and 31st Union have released so far makes me question whether the gaming industry really needs another game like this right now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-ethos-roguelike-hero-shooter-2k-open-area.jpg?itok=QQITTHse 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-ethos-roguelike-hero-shooter-2k-open-area.jpg?itok=X_d-ocqh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>stand out from the crowd?</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to get a chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, 2K says it's live for a single playtest this weekend before the developers head back in to continue working on the game.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://ethos.2k.com/playtest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up for the playtest here</a>, but the catch is that you'll need to watch at least 30 minutes of a Twitch "partner creator" playing the game in order to secure a drop that contains the key.</p>
<p>On the signup page, you'll also find an outline of what kind of PC specs you'll need to play&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, as well as which countries can take part and more. Happy hunting!</p>

            <p>Bohemia Interactive have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-4">Arma 4</a>, the next big instalment in their shooter simulation series, will release in 2027. The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser</a> than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.</p><!--more-->

</span></p><p>Bohemia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arma-reforger-bohemias-bridge-towards-arma-4-has-left-early-access">unveiled Arma 4 back in 2022</a>, telling CJ (RPS in peace) that the intervening Arma Reforger would serve as a kind of bridge or testing ground: it has allowed Arma modders to experiment with the developer's Enfusion engine, and equipped Arma 4 developers with player data and feedback. Reforger <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arma-reforger-bohemias-bridge-towards-arma-4-has-left-early-access">left early access in November 2023</a>, with the final update adding such features as a totally revised supply system and something approximating fast travel.</p>
<p>If you're new to Arma, it's one of the most realism-driven simulations on the shop - so much so that the US Army has used Arma games for training, and Bohemia developers were famously once arrested by Greek police for taking research photos of military installations. Bohemia even had their own division dedicated to making testing simulations for a while - eventually named Bohemia Interactive Simulations, this was sold off in 2013 and has become a standalone business entity that uses the same engine technology. Bohemia's love of realism has also seen nefarious parties attempt to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bohemia-warns-against-spread-of-fake-israelipalestinian-conflict-videos-actually-created-in-arma-3">pass off footage of Arma games as real-life war photography</a>.</p><p>Hi-fi battlefield recreations aside, Bohemia are also the developers of the legendary DayZ, an enormous Arma mod taking the form of an open world zombie survival experience, which entered early access in 2013. I've never had huge interest in Arma, but DayZ's obsessively in-depth injury systems have given rise to some of my favourite video game travel writing, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/the-healing-touch-dr-wasteland-brings-hope-to-day-zs-grim-world/">the tale of Dr Wasteland</a>. Perhaps I'll try to get into Arma: Reforger properly in the run-up to Arma 4. It's not like there's any rush.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the DLC level would be sold separately for $5. A Steam review bombing campaign ensued, and now Bandai Namco is giving players $5 worth of free <em>Tekken</em> coins to try to get everyone to chill out. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196215,194842" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We apologize for not meeting the community’s expectations for the ‘Playable Character Year 1 Pass’ content and the “Genmaji Temple’ DLC release method,” the <em>Tekken</em> account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1846914526530166812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TEKKEN/status/1846914526530166812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday</a></span>. “After thoroughly discussing the feedback, the <em>Tekken</em> Project team has decided on the following measures.”</p><p>To placate angry fans, those who purchased the year 1 character pass will get an upcoming winter battle stage for free, while everyone who logs onto the game between October 29 and November 26 will get 500 Tekken coins (which is equivalent to $5 of in-game currency) to spend on other microtransactions. And it seems to be working. “This is a W for Tekken! Thanks for listening to feedback,” reads the first comment on the post. </p><p>While there was never an explicit promise that future DLC stages would be included in the $3 character pass, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/oct/01/harada-apologizes-microtransaction-tekken8-community/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/oct/01/harada-apologizes-microtransaction-tekken8-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Event Hubs</em> reports</a></span> that recent fighting game microtransaction trends in <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and<em> Tekken</em> have conditioned fans to expect certain things will be included in annual passes. It didn’t help that the Genmaji Temple stage was released alongside the latest DLC character, Heichachi Mishima, who was included in the character pass. Even those who already spent $110 on the most expensive version of<em> Tekken 8</em> still needed to pay more to access the new level. </p><p>In a now-deleted statement, director Katsuhiro Harada addressed the outrage earlier this month:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I understand that the community has some questions about the release of this stage DLC. As the person in charge of the <em>Tekken</em> franchise, I apologize.</p><p>It was made clear from the beginning that the Year One Pass (Season Pass) would not include stages, BUT even so, when the Lidia Sobieska DLC was released, the [Sea Side Resort Stage was a free update], and in this case, the [Even though the additional Story Mode, which should have had the highest development costs, is a Free Update].</p><p>BUT [the Genmaji stage was Sold Separately], and as a result, the release ended up being one that was NOT well understood or Accepted by everyone (at least the almost all community was expecting a pattern similar to that of Lidia).﻿</p></blockquote><p>Harada said he would review how Bandai Namco communicates with players and structures DLC releases in the future to make sure players are on the same page, but days later <em>Tekken 8 </em>was thrust into a new controversy when Chinese pro player Essence|XCC was disqualified from a recent tournament for residing in an ineligible country. “We understand that this decision has cause disappointment among some members of the community, and we will consider adjusting the official rules for future seasons,” the <em>Tekken</em> esports organizers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/oct/06/chinese-player-disqualified-tekken-tgu2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2024/oct/06/chinese-player-disqualified-tekken-tgu2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote earlier this month</a></span>. Harada was once again also apparently confused about the situation.</p><p>But a second, even more severe round of negative Steam reviews hit <em>Tekken 8</em> anyway due to the player’s ban. Things have evened out in recent days, but the game’s Steam rating has still been hurt. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s currently at “mixed”</a></span> despite praise for the underlying game and its PC performance. We’ll see if the latest giveaway helps at all. Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1843944935655104781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1843944935655104781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also previously announced</a></span> that <em>Tekken </em>would “make every effort to increase the number of participating countries in the future” to avoid situations like what happened to Essence|XCC. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
