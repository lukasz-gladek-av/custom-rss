			<p>Asobo Studios recently patched Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with Sim Update 3 to include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The technology allows owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards to achieve even higher frame rates, accelerating performance by 4.2x on average compared to DLSS off.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In two days, the third-person action/adventure game Hell is Us will also launch with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Of course, those equipped with older RTX GPUs can still activate DLSS Frame Generation and/or DLSS Super Resolution. Moreover, Hell is Us is among those games that have been initially selected to be upgraded for the NVIDIA RTX Blackwell update on GeForce NOW, which means GeForce NOW Ultimate subscribers will be able to activate NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation even on the cloud. By the way, Hell is Us received a great score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review on Wccftech</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences. With a rich atmosphere, stunning visuals, deep lore, wonderfully realized characters and a fairly solid combat experience, it's not a game to be missed.</em></p>



<p>On the same day, Thursday, September 4, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting its The Order of Giants DLC (on which you may read <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an exclusive interview with the developers from Gamescom 2025</a>). The free update that goes live alongside the DLC will add the long-awaited NVIDIA RTX Hair feature to the game, improving the quality of hair and other hair-related rendering elements for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

<p>The following day, Friday, September 5, will mark the launch of Bloober Team's new horror IP Cronos: The New Dawn, which also includes day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-says-ps5-barrier-to-blame-for-slowing-monster-hunter-wilds-sales.1286361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has blamed something he calls the "PS5 barrier" for slowing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales, suggesting that the console and its ancillary purchases are at least partly responsible for the game's underperformance in recent months.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nikkei</a> (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DriftingSpirit</a>; we're using machine translation for the interview), Tsujimoto says that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' "main platform" is the PS5, but that the "barrier" for this platform is "unexpectedly large".</p>

<p>He says that the console costs around 80,000 yen in Japan (which works out at around $540), but that when adding "software and monthly subscriptions", that cost can reach about 100,000 yen (roughly $670). This, Tsujimoto says, is "not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=VUUTLu7G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=wDvpE_4i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' slowing sales are at least partly down to the "PS5 barrier", according to Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Tsujimoto, this situation isn't unique to Japan, but is "similar overseas as well". Relatedly, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us" rel="nofollow">increased prices for the PS5</a> in the US back in August, with all three major models of the console affected by the price hike.</p>

<p>Tsujimoto says that "sales will begin in the future", presumably pointing to discounts for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>on the horizon. He also says the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">successful launch</a> at around 50,000 yen proves the "high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers".</p>

<p>It's telling that Tsujimoto doesn't make reference to any of the other factors that might be causing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales to slow down.</p>

<p>Players have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">complained</a>, for instance, about the game's lackluster PC performance and lack of endgame content, prompting Capcom to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">move its plans for the latter forward</a> to an earlier patch in August and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">promise more PC optimizations this winter</a>.</p>




<p>It's entirely possible that word-of-mouth regarding these problems has put some players off buying the game, so perhaps when Capcom addresses these issues, sales might pick up. Of course, discounts in major storefront sales won't hurt, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> arrives at an interesting time in these early months after the release of Switch 2. There haven't been many AAA-styled heavy-hitters to push this system so far, certainly not in terms of action games, at least. And so, Titanic Scion feels like it should give us a reasonable idea of how the console is positioned to handle this type of experience.</p>
<p>And it's a rough first pass. The console's just out, and this is a big old game with a whole lot going on, so it follows, rather unsurprisingly, that some issues are present, and concessions have had to be made to get it running on Nintendo's machine. It turns out the Switch 2 really isn't a pocket PS5 after all! But we knew that, you and I. It just stings a little when your new console can't play the new thing as nice as some other, not-quite-as-new consoles.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158421/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Does it hurt the experience that it doesn't match the 60fps found on other machines? Yes, it does a bit. I've been switching between this and the PS5 demo the past few days and it's absolutely better playing at 60fps, because of course it is. However, the main takeaway I have from playing that demo is actually that, besides the drop in frames, there's a surprising amount of parity across the board with regard to tech issues and jankiness.</p>
<p>This has been useful, because Titanic Scion, as flashy as it is in its combat and its robot models, and as sweet as its vistas can look as you jet-blast across enemy-strewn deserts and through crumbling city-scapes, doesn't half have a bunch of low-res textures crammed in there. It's a bit janky to look at, on all systems. So it's not your Switch 2's fault on that front.</p>
<p>But let's rewind a little - let's cool the old thruster jets, as they say, and talk about what this game, with its ludicrous moniker, is actually all about. What does it want? For the uninitiated, let me break it down thusly: Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a semi-open world game that sees you blast around large locations in a customisable mech suit. It's like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/armored_core_vi_fires_of_rubicon">Armored Core</a>, especially the most recent one, in how it gives you basic story plot points and loads of side missions of the "go fight" or "go get that thing" variety, then boots you out the door to get busy kicking the life out of stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158418/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything here is, essentially, about the mechs. It's about finding weapons, upgrading, unlocking new skills — which is interesting in this one, so I'll get back to that — and making your big robot-self more powerful. You can play it in co-op online (which I couldn't for this review), and compared to the first game, everything here is bigger, more open, and more interesting. Heck, even the story, which is still fairly threadbare, is better. Which isn't saying much, mind, but progress is progress, comrades.</p>
<p>So, here you are, big robot person, brave and strong. And right at the start of the game you find yourself fighting back on behalf of humanity, a brave merc putting it all on the line against the Sovereign Axiom Empire (the traditional bad guys of the piece), whilst also having matters complicated somewhat by the arrival of...well...aliens who want to kill you.</p>
<p>Now, there <em>is</em> more to the story, but not much, so it's best you experience the rest of that for yourself without my spoiling. I should also point out that, whilst the narrative is no great shakes (and the English voice dub is a disaster, so get the Japanese on immediately), there are some very slick and stylish cutscenes holding it together, not to mention all of the fantastically cool mechs and sexy futuristic character designs there are to salivate over. It also does a good line in OTT pantomime villains who talk waaaay too much before I get to beat the crap out of them with a laser sword and a giant hammer. Which is something I always appreciate.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158426/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no real need to dwell on the narrative aspects here because, really, it's all about the robots. And in this regard, Daemon X Machina is a decent enough time. It can't match the likes of FromSoftware's Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (now there's a game I want to see on this console), because, quite frankly, not many action games can, but it finds a place for itself, regardless.</p>
<p>Where Titanic Scion excels is in presenting <em>solid</em> mech scraps that are quick and easy to get into, and this time around it presents them in open-world areas that are improved over its predecessor. This makes for a tighter core gameplay loop overall, as the exploration involved, whilst still fairly simple (you can scan areas to highlight most items), does provide enough hidden secrets, bases to run amok in and, most importantly, sweet loot to find, that the game doesn't feel like it's exclusively about making the attack stats go up. Oh, and you also get to ride around in cars, on horses, and on a motorbike that transforms into a gun. Every little helps.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158423/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I mentioned unlocking new skills earlier, and one of the big shifts in this sequel is that they've attempted, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-a-smart-evolution-for-mech-fans-and-a-good-early-test-for-switch-2">as I spoke about in my preview</a>, to make things a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter</a> this time out. You can chip DNA strands off bad guys, you see, and the bigger and stronger the baddie, the better the DNA will be. Once you've got some of these genetic markers, you can then get busy fusing different strands in order to unlock abilities - at the cost of some fairly hideous mutations to the look of your custom-built avatar. Hey, that's the price of being able to do a turbo kick into a mech enemy's head, mate.</p>
<p>This makes for a situation where you actively <em>want</em> to get into big fights, where usually you might avoid them (especially when you are me), and overall it's a smart addition that melds well with the undeniable depth that's already there in terms of customisation and weapon setups.</p>
<p>With left and right main weapon slots, two side slots, a shoulder and auxiliary slot for weapons, and varying sizes and styles of mech to get to grips with, there's plenty of scope for differing playstyles here at a basic level, and while the first few missions disappoint with lacklustre weapons, give it a few hours and you'll be rocking huge guns called stuff like 'Revenant' that can one-shot those annoying floating testicle things that had been the bane of my existence for a little while.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158422/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With plenty of scope to mix and match, the devs then bring suitably cool weapons to the party, and you can come at the battles presented in a surprising number of ways as a result. I've had a spell rocking a shield and laser sword, mostly because it looks cool to do that when you're a robot, but I also really enjoy dual-wielding machine guns to bother enemies as I circle them, wait for them to get a little tired and then blammo with my long-ranged sniper rifle.</p>
<p>The weapon slots on offer make it a breeze to switch between setups of this nature on-the-fly in battle, and even the CQC — with its hammers and shanks and even grabbing and throwing enemies — holds up, whether you're getting in for punches and timing your dodges to keep the pressure on, or hanging back and hiding and doing all the things that I like to do.</p>
<p>With a decent spread of enemy types and solid combat, this is better than its predecessor already, so if you enjoyed that one, you know you're in for a good time here. However, there are issues. Plenty of them, in fact.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158424/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of performance, even when making peace with the fact that you're looking at 30fps here, I can't help but feel as though I'm experiencing input lag of sorts. It feels mushy and messy at times. On the PS5 version, there's the same feeling; it doesn't feel quite as tight as it should, especially in its dodging, and I think the drop in frame rate on Switch 2 exacerbates this to the point that sometimes I could lose a scrap for reasons other than my own skill failings. Which is not okay.</p>
<p>It makes for a messy feel to the combat — the core of the entire thing — and whilst it's still very playable, and I've completed the roughly 80 hours of tasks it took me to see the end with little real problem, it's disappointing that it's not much slicker. There's also some slowdown as you pass into new areas. Again, this is also noticeable on the PS5, so it's not specifically a Switch 2 thing. Indeed, beyond the frame rate, there's nothing here that I'd worry was the fault of the Switch 2, overly. It's just a game with a lot of rough edges that needs a few patches.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158430/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And so, overall, whilst a bit clunky and messy in places, Daemon X Machina is still a reasonably decent time for folk who enjoy customising mechs with a side-helping of perfectly serviceable exploration for good measure, and especially in handheld, where the low-res textures aren't quite so blown up as they are on a big TV. However, the issues with stuttering, mushy controls, and general weakness of the story are hard to ignore, and go quite some way in knocking the experience down.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a decent mech game with plenty of depth in its weapons setups and lots of cool loot to discover in its large open-world maps. The combat is flexible, it's fast, and it's very often plenty of fun.</p>
<p>However, performance issues — which are also present on other platforms, so don't sweat it too much, Switch 2 owners — make for a janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback. It's just not nearly as polished as it could be in this respect. With stutters loading into new areas and low-res textures a common sight (again, also on other systems), the overall feeling here is of a game that needs a few patches and tweaks to get it where it needs to be.</p></section>

			<p>A new announcement related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be made later this week, but it won't be about new content hitting the game, a CD Projekt Red representative confirmed.</p>



<p>Commenting on speculation made about the announcement on X, CD Projekt Red Senior Community Manager Amelia "Lilayah" confirmed the announcement won't be about a new patch or new DLC. The community manager also reiterated that no Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is in the works, unsurprisingly, so expectations should be kept in check regarding the game getting some new major content in the future.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch.</p>— Amelia "Lilayah" (@Lilayaah) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for what the Cyberpunk 2077 announcement coming on September 4 will be about, no one can say at the moment. This announcement was teased yesterday with an in-lore recruitment ad from the New United States of America, of which Night City is part, revealing a recruitment test for <em>"brave netrunners"</em> willing to join the nation's effort to overcome a mounting cybersecurity threat. Given how Project Orion, the second entry in the series, is still very far from release, could this be a colorful way to announce playtests for an upcoming, smaller project related to the series? Thankfully, the announcement is only a few days away, so it won't take much longer to find out what this is about.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has been recruited by Xbox to serve as its new chief of staff, following the cancellation of that game earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in early July, Rare's <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> and various staff members at the studio were let go as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider layoff wave</a> at parent company Microsoft. However, it looks as though O'Connor is one of the Rare staffers who's managed to escape unemployment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, O'Connor, who previously served as an artist and animator at Rare before overseeing <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i>as an executive producer, will now occupy the position of Xbox's chief of staff, which means she'll be overseeing the gaming division's various teams and employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=BVMkROeo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=VBb227fk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has found a new home at Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>O'Connor's career with Rare started with 2001's foul-mouthed platformer&nbsp;<em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em>, and after that game was released, she went on to work on titles like Xbox 360 launch title&nbsp;<em>Kameo: Elements of Power</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;2006 life sim&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata</em>.</p>

<p>Her last credit with Rare is a special thanks nod on 2020's side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Battletoads</em>, with which our reviewer Austin was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battletoads-review" rel="nofollow">particularly impressed</a>&nbsp;(the game, that is, not the credit).</p>

<p>O'Connor also isn't the only Rare luminary to jump ship to Xbox in the last twelve months. She follows in the footsteps of former Rare boss Craig Duncan, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring" rel="nofollow">took the place of Xbox's Alan Hartman</a> as the head of Xbox Game Studios back in October last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many Rare staffers weren't as lucky as O'Connor or Duncan, with several employees losing their jobs as part of the aforementioned Microsoft employee cull, including long-time Rare veteran <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gregg Mayles</a> (again, according to VGC).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rare will announce next (if anything; it may end up going the same way as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>studio The Initiative</a>). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong developers have confirmed that players accessing the Nintendo Switch version of the game will receive the Switch 2 upgrade for free.</p>



<p>Team Cherry’s highly anticipated title, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is all set to release on September 4, 2025, and the game’s prices have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The game’s development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-has-hollow-knight-silksong-been-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in 2018</a>, and today players have received one final reminder from the developers 2 days ahead of its official release. </p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-devs-reveal-key-delivery-details-for-switch-and-steam">Hollow Knight: Silksong Devs Reveal Key Delivery Details for Switch and Steam</h2>



<p>The latest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter update</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/hollow-knight-silksong-will-offer-a-free-switch-2-upgrade-pack-for-switch-1-backers-1594543/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameReactor</a>) from Team Cherry reveals that backers and players who have completed the survey will receive their keys shortly before the release. Nintendo Switch players will receive the game keys directly via email. Switch 2 players will need to redeem the Switch key, download the game, and then download the additional free Hollow Knight: Silksong Upgrade Pack from the eShop to unlock the platform’s enhanced features. </p>



<p>As for Steam/DRM-free: Similar to the previous installment, Steam keys will be delivered via Humble Bundle, and they include the official soundtrack for all players. DRM-free versions will be sent out through the same link, but they “will not be visible until launch.” Surveys will end tomorrow, and players who were not able to make the cut-off will have to mail the developers directly. </p>

                <p>Even more evidence has come to light that suggests the next Nintendo Direct event could take place very soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate2 has backed up the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">initial reports</a> of the next Nintendo Direct coming in September, <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1962214416339833244?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying</a>, "Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September."</p><p>But when? The leaker said fans can expect it during the second week of September. He said it's likely to happen on September 11 or 12. That matches up with a previous report that the event could happen on September 12, which is one day before the 40th anniversary of the release of 1985's original Super Mario Bros.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As for what might be on tap for the next Nintendo Direct, the leaker said <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962217694314287346" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it's possible</a> the Direct could be the venue for the announcement of the rumored Red Dead Redemption II port for Switch 2."Maybe? Depends if Nintendo was able to court Rockstar. RDR2 is Switch 2 bound regardless of announcement/reveal venue," NateTheHate2 said.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on August 19 and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/" data-ref-id="2900-6889">beefy broadcast focused exclusively on Kirby: Air Riders.</a></p><p>Nintendo has held a September Nintendo Direct <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1962493754889101707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">each September for the past eight out of nine years</a>, so it would be a more notable event if Nintendo <em>did not </em>have a Direct on tap for September 2025.</p><p>If the Nintendo Direct is real, it would be the second major platform-holder's broadcast in September, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-playstation-state-of-play-announced-coming-very-soon/1100-6534390/" data-ref-id="1100-6534390">next PlayStation State of Play event lined up for September 3. </a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has asked players to stop sending harsh, non-constructive criticism to developers as it can be demoralising.</p>
<p>Yoshida discussed the topic of dealing with feedback at a panel during PAX West last week. The MMORPG's community is known for being particularly vocal, while Yoshida himself is in frequent dialogue through the Letter from the Producer streams and Fan Fest events.</p>
<p>Yoshida first noted players and developers are "in the same community" due to their love of games. "Whenever there are comments being directed towards us, I try to understand where they're coming from, what they're trying to tell us," he said.</p>

<p>He continued: "Positive feedback is great and it's a great motivator to aim to continue making those players happy.</p>
<p>"We see gamers as allies or friends…I want to continue that mutual understanding."</p>
<p>Yoshida then specifically addressed negative feedback.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p><p>"Some players I know want to express their frustrations, but I think very harsh words will sometimes hurt developers very deeply. I think this applies for any creator in the video game industry. And some of the harsh words that were thrown at some of them, it could potentially demoralise them so much that they don't want to make video games anymore. And in the end we - as in the gamers - would miss out on good work that these people could potentially have made just because people have thrown these very harsh words and non-constructive criticism at those people. It just becomes such a negative environment.</p>
<p>He concluded: "So whenever you are drafting your post before you hit enter you might want to reconsider."</p>

<p>While Yoshida didn't specify any particular experience here, he has previously discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic criticism sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a> following the release of the Dawntrail expansion.</p>
<p>Really, though, Yoshida's words apply to all game developers. While players are often passionate about their favourite games, sending abuse is never a valid response.</p>

<figure><a title="fc 26 switch 2 port" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ade2224325b10/fc-26-switch-2-port.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we know that the folks behind big AAA sports game releases — and especially yearly ones where they really have to scrape the barrel and make up new words like 'TruMotion' and things of this nature to keep us interested — like to engage the pre-release hype train. It's part of life, it's part of nature. It keeps the soul warm and the planet spinning.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/ea-sports-fc-26-nintendo-switch-2-performance-powerful-good/">Game Rant</a> a few days ago (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-power-ea-sports-fc/">NintendoEverything</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> dev Andreas Wilsdorf has been rather unexpectedly verbose in his claims on just how nicely his latest football game is running on Nintendo's new machine. To the point that it almost feels a little too good to be true, especially when considering how some of the game's beta and show-floor demo players seem to be finding things.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kxilsh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>During an interview about the game with line producer Wilsdorf and career mode design director Pete O'Donnell, Wilsdorf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In general, the Switch 2 was really exciting. Being on the platform with FC this year, the performance is what really excites us. It is on parity, basically, with what we see on PS5 and Xbox. Again, it's a [handheld] console, but the first time I played with it, I was really impressed. Then, we also saw it working on the simulation and the times it takes to simulate the season and so on, which was very, very close to what we saw in PlayStation and Xbox devkits. That's really impressive."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, of course, this is fantastic news on the face of things, but it doesn't mesh with some of the real-world evidence that we've been presented with elsewhere. Indeed, there has been a beta of the game running on Switch and Switch 2 (we didn't get a code, unfortunately), and players of that version have been reporting in on the game's Reddit forum with their impressions:</p>

<p>As you can see from this particular post, it seems as though the game hasn't been impressing everyone, although it is impossible to 100% confirm that these people are actually playing the Switch 2 version, rather than the Switch 1 beta - there has been some confusion it seems, and elsewhere other early beta players have an entirely different take on the experience:</p>

<p>Felix Sanchez, one of our intrepid video producers, got to go hands-on with the game at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> recently and came away unimpressed after playing in docked mode. "It felt almost exactly like 25 on Switch," he says. "Sure, it ran stable, but it's still running at what seemed like 30fps and the graphics are quite a downgrade compared to other platforms."</p>
<p>After years of disappointing '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">Legacy</a>' versions of FIFA on Switch, EA finally delivered an up-to-date, feature-rich game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">EA Sports FC 24</a>, and we were hoping Switch 2's power would open up possibilities for the series that weren't possible on older Nintendo hardware. With just a few weeks to go, and as much as we want to believe it's gonna be as good as Mr Wilsdorf says, the 30fps gameplay (which would be a disaster for many excited FC fans) and the expected excision of crossplay have got us interested to see how it turns out when the oven bell finally dings on September 26th. Or even sooner, if we get a demo.</p>

Pitchford also expressed the desire to bring more Gearbox games to the platform, though he wouldn't elaborate any further than that on this topic.</p>



<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an awesome, awesome machine – I'm so grateful for it. It's less about innovating and more about perfecting, and giving us what we want and what works. I love my Switch, and I kind of wanted a more powerful one with newer games. When I got the briefing and realized, 'oh, it's more than that, Nintendo has invested a lot, not just in the hardware, but in the software, and making it easier than ever to connect with other people. This is getting exciting.</em></p>



<p><em>I love Switch, and I love my Nintendo Switch 2, and I think that without getting in trouble and trying to talk about things that are from the future, we love making games, and we love entertaining people, and we want to be on the platforms where the people that want us to be are. And Nintendo just had the most successful new console launch in the history of video game consoles, and I don't think that's slowing down.</em> <em>I love that platform, and I want to bring more games to it, but it's really not the right time for me to talk about games that are down the road.</em></p>



<p>As far as we know, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-and-brothers-in-arms-games-listed-on-developers-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working</a> on a new Brothers in Arms game and possibly Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, a sequel to the 2022 spin-off featuring the titular Tiny Tina as the 'dungeon master'. The completion status of these projects is currently unclear.</p>

              <p>Roborock is celebrating its 11th birthday and instead of just blowing out the candles, the company is going to be giving the gifts to its customers. For a limited time, the entire line of smart robot vacuums is available with massive discounts and the discounts are so good that <strong>most of the models have reached their record low prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/">Roborock Q8 Max is our favorite, and it’s currently on sale at $179, down from $599</a>. It’s not the newest model in the series but in<strong> terms of value for money it’s unbeatable</strong>, which is also why it’s the company’s best-selling unit in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday</h2>
<p>The powerful suction, <strong>which is 5500 Pa</strong>, is one of the first things you notice and it gives it the cleaning capability that’s usually reserved for high-end devices. Dust, crumbs, tiny particles and embedded dirt in carpets all disappear just as easily as lighter material resting on hardwood. Supporting this power is <strong>Roborock’s DuoRoller brush system</strong> that’s a smart twin roller design that’s resistant to hair tangling and rolls easily across a range of surfaces. For pet owners, this is peace of mind that the vacuum won’t be choked after a single pass through a hairy patch in the living room.</p>
<p>But a robot vacuum is more than just brute force, because if it doesn’t clean intelligently, performance quickly becomes frustrating: That’s where the Q8 Max differs from bargain-class machines. With Roborock’s PreciSense LiDAR navigation system, <strong>it accurately scans and maps the home</strong>, and builds a detailed layout that allows it to map routes logically. Combined with obstacle detection technology, the Roborock Q8 Max neatly avoids cords, toys, and table legs, so it gets stuck less and has more time actually cleaning.</p>



<p>Another reason this model has been so popular is that it does not just vacuum,<strong> it also mops and it does both in a single pass</strong>. The onboard electronic water tank has thirty levels of flow control so you can adjust the mop output to clean anything from sensitive hardwood to tile. This means beyond a surface touch-up, you get a deeper clean without needing to switch devices or start multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Battery life and independence are also crucial to the experience: The <strong>5200 mAh battery offers up to four hours of runtime from a single charge</strong>, and covers areas as large as 300 square meters in one go. To further simplify upkeep, the automatic dust-emptying dock holds weeks’ worth of debris in its 2.5-liter sealed bag. For most households, that means quite literally <strong>not needing to consider bin emptying for nearly two months</strong> as your robot does the lion’s share of the floor cleaning quietly in the background. Add in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri compatibility, and it is a home companion that responds to voice commands without demanding attention in return.</p>
<p>That’s why the Q8 Max has been the best-seller for Roborock.</p>
<p>With Roborock celebrating its 11 years of innovation, getting the opportunity to grab the Q8 Max at this all-time low&nbsp; price point makes it a no-brainer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a brand new update today, patch 01.004.000, which introduces randomly-generated cave systems, new missions, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s Discord was recently discussing co-op split-screen as a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technically feasible</a>” feature, with many players hoping it will arrive as one in a new update. We didn’t get split-screen, but Arrowhead has released a massive update, which will have players exploring Terminid Hive Worlds, exterminating abhorrent new enemy types, and completing new missions. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-update-adds-randomly-generated-cave-systems-new-enemies-and-more">Helldivers 2 Update Adds Randomly-Generated Cave Systems, New Enemies, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-hive-worlds">Hive Worlds</h3>



<p>As mentioned, Helldivers 2’s new update will have players exploring Hive Worlds, which are randomly-generated giant cave systems that pose a new tactical challenge. While exploring these caves, players will find new disgusting flora and fauna as well as advanced Terminid life. Players will discover acid lakes and advanced bug spires on the Hive World surface, and there will be hols in the room to use the stratagems. Walls are destructible, making it slightly easier to navigate in these caves, but they will surely be dark and scary. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-missions">New Missions</h3>



<p>The new update will task players with exploring the deepest corners of these caves and destroying the Spore Lung to stop its infectious Gloom from spreading. Players will need to take over the GATER mobile oil rig to extract the mysterious oily substance from these Hive Worlds. Lastly, many missions will require players to collect resources and destroy enemy threats to these caves. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p>Coming to the new enemies in the latest Helldivers 2 update 01.004.000, players will be faced against four new types: Rupture Spewer, Rupture Warrior, Rupture Charger, and Dragonroach. The Spewer emerges from the ground to “spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent”. The Warrior is a Gloom-induced mutation that prefers open-air movement. The Chargers tunnel through the ground at high speeds. Lastly, the Dragonroach is an oversized creature that flies and circles its prey and can also spew air-combustible acid. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Set coordinates for the Terminid Hive Worlds – and pack the extra-strength bug spray. We’re exterminating the galaxy’s most disgusting infestation in a patriotic payback mission of no mercy.</p><p>Abhorrent new enemy types, thrilling missions, strange worlds and spectacular beasts… <a href="https://t.co/WDD7qFeWro">pic.twitter.com/WDD7qFeWro</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1962802722517786694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-balancing-and-fixes">Balancing and Fixes</h3>



<p>Several new balancing changes have been made, including buffs to the Orbital Smoke, Orbital E.M.S., and Mortar E.M.S. stratagems. Moreover, stratagems, throwables, and Boosters like Mortar E.M.S., Orbital E.M.S., Stun Grenade, Urchin, and Stun Hellpod have had their stagger strength increase. Conversely, all of their stagger impulse have been reduced to zero. </p>



<p>A plethora of fixes have been implemented across various aspects of the game, including Crashes, soft locks, weapons, stratagems, enemies, missions, and miscellaneous areas. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-in-helldivers-2-01-004-000-september-2-update">All Patch Notes in Helldivers 2 01.004.000 September 2 Update</h2>



<h3><strong>New Additions</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Hive Worlds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Randomly-generated giant cave systems</li>



<li>A new tactical challenge</li>



<li>Discover disgusting flora and fauna and advanced Terminid life</li>



<li>Hive World surface – acid lakes and advanced bug spires</li>



<li>Holes in the cave roof will allow stratagems to be called down</li>



<li>Destructible walls within the caves to navigate</li>



<li>Bring a flashlight!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Delve deep into the caves to destroy the Spore Lung and stop its infectious Gloom spread</li>



<li>Take control of the GATER mobile oil rig and siphon the mysterious oily substance from the surface of Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Undertake more missions to extract resources and destroy the enemy threat on Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Have Super Earth approved levels of fun!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Enemies</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rupture Spewer; The foul Rupture Spewer bursts from the ground only to spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent. Upon returning to its dark warrens, it is believed to consume its own dead in order to generate more of its corrosive acid.</li>



<li>Rupture Warrior; A product of Gloom-induced mutation, the Rupture Warrior has lost the UV-insulating chitin layer that would protect its internal organs from solar radiation damage. Captured specimens prefer burrowing to open-air movement, a pattern indicative of subconscious shame at their own undemocratic ways.</li>



<li>Rupture Charger; When this armored beast senses the presence of Liberty, it buries itself underground to escape its light. Its Charger instincts compel it to tunnel through the ground at high speeds, emerging only to attack those who represent the Liberty that blinds it so.</li>



<li>Dragonroach; This oversized affront to Free skies everywhere circles its would-be prey, swooping down intermittently to bespew them with air-combustible acid. A spineless tactic befitting an exoskeletal monstrosity. </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-balancing"><strong>Balancing</strong></h3>



<p>Unified “non-explosive Orbitals” so they have the same projectile damage and destruction values as the Orbital gas. This effects:</p>



<p><strong><br>Orbital smoke</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Increased Projectile Damage&nbsp; 0 → 300&nbsp;</li>

<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Orbital E.M.S</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Increased Projectile Damage 250 → 300&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased Projectile AP 3 → 7</li>



<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p>Unified Stun explosions work. They all apply the stun effect on the explosion and not only on the status effect volume. This effects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Orbital E.M.S</li>



<li>Mortar E.M.S</li>
</ul>



<p>Changed how all stun explosions work in that they now initially stagger the enemy they stun but also without ragdolling the player if hit by such an explosion</p>



<p><strong>Throwables</strong></p>



<p>Stun grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 0 -&gt; 50</li>
</ul>

<li>Decreased stagger impulse 15 -&gt; 0&nbsp;</li>

<li>Fixed crash that could occur during hot-joining</li>



<li>Fixed a rare crash that could occur when dropping backpacks</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapons &amp; Stratagem Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixes for mute AX/LAS-5 ‘GUARD DOG’ ROVER audio</li>



<li>Audio fixes for multiple weapons not having reverb applied to them</li>



<li>Fixed Hellpod payloads being targetable by guidance system</li>



<li>GL-52 De-Escalator stratagem input code now begins with a down arrow, inline with other support weapon stratagems</li>

</ul>



<p><strong>Miscellaneous Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fix flickering VFX shadows in some areas.</li>



<li>Fixed strange movement after falling while marching</li>



<li>Fixed chat typing animations – Helldivers no longer suffer from fat fingers and will use their writing pads when typing chat messages.</li>



<li>Fixed the Adreno-Defibrillator status effect not affecting Helldivers inside combat walkers</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the planetary hazard damaged Hellbombs will visually appear to explode twice when shot by GL-21 Grenade Launcher, from the shooter’s POV</li>
</ul>

            <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> Unlimited, a community project that aims to make Ubisoft racer The Crew playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, have announced a release date.</p>
<p>If you need a bit of a refresher, Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">take The Crew's servers offline</a> in March 2024 rendered it totally unplayable even for those who own a physical copy, due to its online-only nature. That's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">served as the spark</a> for the Stop Killing Games campaign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">we've reported on</a> as its organisers have petitioned lawmakers across the world to ensure companies are required by law to put concrete end-of-life plans in place, when they decide to switch a game's servers off. It also set a group of Crewers off on a quest to make the game playable again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For a year or so, The Crew Unlimited's devs have been working towards that goal. They've now announced a release date for their creation, which comprises of a server emulator designed to stand in for those Ubisoft took offline. As per an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1412163460955115520">Discord</a> from project lead whammy4, it'll come out on September 15th, 2025, and be distributed for free to minimise the chances of the publisher directing their lawyers to intervene.</p>
<p>"We were trying everything we could, anything to preserve the game," reads The Crew Unlimited's freshly published <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">website</a>. "We eventually came to the conclusion that writing a server emulator for The Crew was the best and only solution. This would allow us to effectively implement both an Offline Mode and an Online Mode back into the game, Offline Mode simply being a local server running on your computer while playing the game. Your local server, your local savegames, your game. No one will ever be able to take this away from you now."</p><p>The Crew Unlimited'll be grabbable from that same site once it's live, and you'll need to have owned The Crew on PC before to access it, as the devs won't be illegally distributing game files. You know, because that'd almost definitely result in Ubisoft's lawyers coming down like a ton of bricks. Though, the project's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ</a> does see them admit that they've got no way on their end of telling a legit copy from a pirated copy, so they'll have to let all players in regardless, which sounds far from ideal.</p>
<p>In a Discord discussion linked in the FAQ, the devs have made some notes about what works in terms of re-downloading your old The Crew save files. I'd say players may well be in for a tricky time getting things up and running. The devs say you'll need to start from scratch unless you only want to play offline, and have already used a tool they developed to dump your save prior to the game's shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they also hint that their online server may harbour a few additions or changes. That said, the group insist tweaks outside of any new stuff would be limited to "technical improvements and careful rebalancing", and that they'd "never change the core experience of the game".</p>
<p>All in all, even though the project's been public info for around a year now, with whammy4 having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIo4l-BpK8s">posted videos of them driving around in it</a> to YouTube, it's maybe worth waiting to see how the release plays out before you give it a go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>No Man’s Sky is enjoying a huge resurgence on Steam following the anniversary update released last week, reaching heights it has not been at in years.</p>



<p>Initially released in 2016, No Man’s Sky endured a troubled launch, but has established itself as one of gaming’s biggest comebacks in the years since, following a wealth of free updates.</p>



<p>The most recent, the Anniversary Update, launched on August 28 and in the days since, the playerbase on Steam has seen a huge spike in its playerbase.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-hits-highest-peak-since-launch">No Man’s Sky Hits Highest Peak Since Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shining light. Image via Hello Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB data</a>, No Man’s Sky hit a peak of 98,285 concurrent players yesterday, September 1, the highest total that the game has seen since it’s release nine years ago.</p>



<p>The numbers are narrowly ahead of July 2018, the previously post-release high that saw 97,000 concurrent players, but have edged past that number to set a new post-launch record.</p>



<p>Although still some way off the all-time peak of over 212,000 players on Steam from launch, it shows that the dedicated work from Hello Games has not gone unnoticed, with players still keen to enjoy the massive adventure across the stars.</p>



<p>The signs are certainly promising for Hello Games ahead of the release of Light No Fire, the upcoming title for the studio that has been teased, with a release date yet to be set.</p>



<p>Light No Fire is the sixth most wishlisted game on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, beneath only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>With many of those games due to be released in the coming months, Light No Fire could rise further up the charts.</p>



<p>Have you been lured back into No Man’s Sky following the most recent update? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Like previous Borderlands games, Gearbox Software has big plans to keep players invested in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> well after they've wrapped up the campaign and all of its side missions. Free and paid DLC are on the cards, as players can expect new expansions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">new Vault Hunters</a>, and an endgame that will be updated weekly.</p><p>For the paid content, Story Packs will flesh out the planet of Kairos with post-launch narrative content. Two Story Packs are scheduled to be released in 2026, with the first one planned for release in the first quarter of the year. Gearbox says its first Story Pack will be a bloody, cosmic-horror-inspired tale entitled Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. As the title suggests, this DLC will star Moxxi's daughter Ellie, a trend that will continue in future DLC drops as players can expect to see a few familiar faces pop up.</p>

<p>There'll also be multiple main missions and side missions set inside a new zone set inside a new zone of Kairos included in these Story Packs, as well as a brand-new Vault Hunter, new gear to earn, and a bunch of new cosmetics to unlock. Gearbox says more details on the mystery Vault Hunter will be revealed during the Tokyo Game Show later this month.</p><p>While Story Packs are planned to be <em>big </em>drops, Bounty Packs will offer bite-sized narrative content to dig into. These will give players new gear and cosmetics to earn, as well as a Vault Card that lets you unlock additional loot through gameplay. Each mission in a Bounty Pack will reveal more about the various NPCs of Kairos and give you a new Boss to take down, as well as a Vault Card that gives you more loot and XP via daily and weekly challenges when it's active. Gearbox says that each Vault Card is built around a distinct theme and can be leveled up at your own pace, as there are no time limits or expiring rewards here.</p><p>As mentioned above, this content is available through the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions of Borderlands 4, as well as through bundles or individual purchases. For the free content, Gearbox says that it will continue to support the game with updates and Invincible Bosses will also be coming to the game. These are bosses with <em>massive </em>health pools, unique mechanics, and capable of dealing lethal amounts of damage, so you're going to want to have your Vault Hunter prepared for a serious fight. It's worth taking on an Invincible Boss, as they'll drop some of the best loot in the game when they're defeated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560073" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560073"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg"></figure><p>Borderlands 4 will also include multiple types of free weekly content, such as:</p><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b>: Visit Moxxi's Big Encore Machine, spend some Eridium, and take on a tougher variant of a boss who'll offer greater rewards upon defeat.</li><li><b>Weekly Wildcard Missions</b>: In this community challenge, all players will get the same Weekly Wildcard Mission added to their map. These have a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn until you get your god-roll.</li><li><b>Maurice's Black Market Machine</b>: The talking Saurian Maurice returns in Borderlands 4, and once a week, he'll offer Legendary loot for in-game cash if you can find his Black Market Machine.</li></ul><p>While Legendary-class drops will be rarer in Borderlands 4, expect the return of Pearlescent-grade gear to be even more elusive. The crème de la crème of loot, Pearlescent items will be added to Borderlands 4 in Q1 2026 and these will boast some of the best stats and power in the game.</p><p>Gearbox will also cycle in seasonal mini-events throughout the year, kicking off with the Halloween-themed Horrors of Kairos later this year. The developer says that these will tweak the gameplay and give players new cosmetic items and new Legendary gear to chase after. Finally, the Borderlands 4 endgame will see free updates roll out to Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. If you can overcome the challenges of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, Gearbox says you'll get the best loot rolls in the game.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--as well as Switch 2 in October--and in case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailer-urges-you-to-quit-earth-and-i-really-wish-i-could/1100-6534380/">Gearbox recently released a new live-action trailer</a> encouraging fans to exit Earth and head over to Kairos.</p>

			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>

<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>
