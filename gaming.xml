Unfortunately, <strong><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> also doesn’t support cross-saves</strong>.</p><p>This means that <strong>if you’ve been playing the game on Apple devices since launch and want to pick the game up on Nintendo Switch or PC, you’ll have to start over completely</strong>. You can’t swap freely between the two devices using a single save, nor does the game allow you to transfer a save to a new ecosystem.</p><h2 id="h224638"><a id="online"></a>Do you need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>?</h2><p>Though you can’t play <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> with players on other platforms, Nintendo Switch players can still hook up with other players on that platform via online multiplayer. If you’re looking to pal around with your friends, though, <strong>you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to access multiplayer features</strong>. Luckily, this subscription is only $20 per year, so it’s a small price to pay for playing with your besties, and it will allow you to use online functionality of many other Switch games as well.</p><p>It’s a shame that <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> doesn’t support crossplay or cross-save functionality, but here’s hoping it could come in a future update given how popular these features are. In the meantime, just talk your friends into buying the game within the same ecosystem as you. Be assertive. We believe in you.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>IEM Katowice is considered a prestige event in the massive Counter-Strike 2 calendar, and the best CS2 players there are delivering. The best players in the world are competing in the $1 million tournament, and both some familiar and new faces are shining the brightest.</p>



<p>Here are the best CS2 players from IEM Katowice after the conclusion of the group stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-from-iem-katowice-2025-group-stage">Best CS2 Players from IEM Katowice 2025 Group Stage</h2>



<h3 id="h-danil-donk-kryshkovets">Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</h3>



<p>Is anyone else surprised? You shouldn’t be. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donk-counter-strike-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year’s consensus best player</a> of the year has <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/players?event=8034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highest rating</a> of any player after the IEM Katowice group stages. He also finished with the highest ADR (average damage per round) rating and K/D differential of any player. Unsurprisingly, he was the lead man in Spirit’s playoff-clinching win over GamerLegion.</p>



<h3 id="h-guy-nertz-iluz">Guy “NertZ” Iluz</h3>



<p>Liquid may have fallen short of reaching IEM Katowice playoffs, but fans can be happy with how NertZ performed in Katowice. The team’s newest addition was an absolute force in creating opening kills, and was only outdone in ADR by donk. NertZ is clearly an upgrade for Liquid, and once the team cleans some things up, they should be a more familiar face in playoffs.</p>



<h3 id="h-oldrich-pr-novy">Oldřich “PR” Nový</h3>



<p>Every year, a new player emerges and threatens to break into the top echelon of Counter-Strike players. This year, an early contender for rookie of the year is Oldřich “PR” Nový, a 17 year old Czech player for GamerLegion. After some impressive matches against paiN and MOUZ, PR had a head-turning performance against the once great Astralis. On Mirage in particular, he dropped a staggering 29 kills and only died 7 times. PR and GamerLegion ultimately fell to donk and Spirit, missing playoffs, but he’s a player to keep watching in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-ismailсan-xantares-dortkardes">İsmailсan “XANTARES” Dörtkardeş</h3>



<p>Eternal Fire is one of the hottest teams at the start of 2025, and XANTARES is a big reason why. The veteran rifler was having a solid event throughout groups, but he shined the brightest in a thrilling multi-overtime Nuke game against FaZe. XANTARES dropped a server-high 49 kills on Nuke, and won 12 out of 16 opening duels, pushing Eternal Fire over the finish line and into playoffs over FaZe.</p>

		<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> “<em>Update: We are bringing Destiny 2 back online. Players may be placed into a queue while we continue our investigation,”</em> say Bungie</p>
<p><em>Original story follows…</em></p>


<p>The latest Episode of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Destiny 2</a> launched a few hours ago and players were immediately hit with server issues, some could not get into the game and those who could were being kicked from activities. As a result of the problems Bungie have decided to take the Destiny 2: Heresy offline.</p>
<p><em>“Update: As part of the investigation into today’s server and stability issue, we will be bringing Destiny 2 offline shortly for maintenance. Stand by for updates.” </em>reads a message on<a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">Twitter</a> posted at 7.40pm GMT.</p>
<p>By the way, if you are no longer using Twitter but find it annoying you can’t see Bungie’s tweets when this sort of thing is happening, then bookmark <a href="https://www.bungiehelp.org/">https://www.bungiehelp.org/&nbsp;</a>. It’s a fan-made site that harvests the Tweets for you so you don’t have to use Twitter.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: Heresy is the latest episode and finds Guardians heading back to the Leviathan with a new activity called The Nether which features rogue-like elements, for example health will no longer regenerate.</p>

<p>While you are waiting for the game to come back online, might as well take a gander at the patch notes, as usual they are massive.</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p><strong>Episode Heresy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The final Episode for the year of Destiny 2: The Final Shape has begun.
<ul>
<li>Get in there, Guardians.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crucible</h3>
<p><strong>Trials of Osiris</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rewards
<ul>
<li>Added new rewards, including an armor set, Ghost Shell, ship, Sparrow, and emblem.</li>
<li>No longer requires Flawless to earn most rewards.
<ul>
<li>Moved Trials away from a Flawless-based system to a “get seven wins on a card” system that rewards win streaks, with multiple tiers and exclusive aesthetic rewards for higher win streaks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved the base reward structure of Trials.
<ul>
<li>Pinnacle Challenges now award Trials armor in addition to the Pinnacle gear.</li>
<li>Increased the amount of reputation gained on losses by 10x and added a new bonus that is earned by playing in a fireteam with clanmates.</li>
<li>Added a new set of base rewards for wins and losses that will be added to the existing Trios completion rewards, but for players in any fireteam configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passages – To help simplify the process, we have reduced the number of passages available to players from Saint-14 to two, one for each initial experience.
<ul>
<li>Lighthouse Passage
<ul>
<li>All you need to do is win seven games on a Lighthouse Passage and you will earn entrance to the Lighthouse, regardless of how many losses are on the card.</li>
<li>The Lighthouse Chest rewards are now broken up into two types:
<ul>
<li>Repeatable rewards that you can earn every time you complete a Lighthouse Passage and open the chest.</li>
<li>Weekly win streak rewards (from one to seven wins in a row), which can be earned once per week and must be true win streaks; there are no mercies here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trials Passage
<ul>
<li>We want to provide a separate place in Trials that is more like Iron Banner in terms of rewards and matchmaking to get additional players into the ecosystem.
<ul>
<li>Utilizes Weekly Performance-Based Matchmaking if everyone in your fireteam is on a Completed Lighthouse, Flawless, or Trials Passage.</li>
<li>Trials of Osiris Passage provides a healthy reputation bonus of 75 – 150 per win, depending on your current rank with Saint-14.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skill</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed how skill is tracked and updated for all modes.
<ul>
<li>Objectives are now on par with base kills for points.</li>
<li>Additional points are granted for kills that are in service to the objective.</li>
<li>Removed multiple “farmable” points like damage dealt, revives, and longest kill streak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Player Score Stat and Post Game Scoreboards</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new stat called Player Score is displayed on our post-game scoreboards, which is a direct reflection of how many points you earned towards updating your skill rating in a game.</li>
<li>The post-game scoreboards of all modes now show Opponents Defeated and Combat Efficiency.</li>
<li>Added additional stats to the scoreboards of more modes, including Longest Chain (highest multi-kill medal) and Longest Streak.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Playlist Reorganization and Consolidation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This affects energy refunds from things like Gambler’s Dodge, Shiver Strike, and armor mods, but generally excludes Exotic effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a 10% cooldown penalty to Supers so that there is more of a tradeoff to picking these subclasses in modes where Super timing can be vitally important, like Trials or Competitive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lobby Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have made some changes to the Paired Player lobby balancer so that it will fall back to the Average Lobby Rank balancer less often when dealing with fireteams.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Competitive Collision
<ul>
<li>New logic will prevent the next zone from spawning too near to the active zone.</li>
<li>Contesting a zone will now flip it to neutral so neither team gains points, as opposed to the current behavior where the team that owns the zone continues to accrue points while it is in the contested state.</li>
<li>The new zone will now show up 20 seconds before it opens, instead of 15 seconds, to give teams more time to move to the new area and contest the capture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zone Control
<ul>
<li>Decrease the frequency of Heavy ammo spawning to align it to regular Crucible modes like control at two minutes per spawn (120 seconds) from previously 60-second intervals.</li>

<li>Competitive Point System Rework
<ul>
<li>Removed the expected rank system entirely and streamlined the point gains and losses.
<ul>
<li>Wins and losses – Add or remove a base value of 100 points.</li>
<li>Performance bonus – Linked to Player Score and Efficiency, rewards between -10 and +10 points.</li>
<li>Contribution scalar – This system can grant a bonus of up to +50 to either reduce the points lost on defeat or grant additional points for a win, and will be utilized in two circumstances:
<ul>
<li>First, to help offset occurrences where some players contributed significantly more to the outcome of the game than others.</li>
<li>Second, it can also be applied as quitter compensation when a player has left earlier in the match, but the remaining players continue to finish it out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skill Modifier – Based on the opposing team’s average skill compared to your team’s average skill. Capped at -20 to +20.</li>

<ul>
<li>These waves no longer return towards the barricade – they only travel outwards once.</li>

<ul>
<li>Now uses a meter to track Death Throes. This means it decays down through the tiers rather than falling off completely when the duration expires.

The first trailer is out, and the short, 90-second teaser gives us plenty to dissect. Let’s dive in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>takes place in a 1960s-inspired retro-future, so it’s fitting that the trailer starts in a 4:3 aspect ratio similar to what you would have seen on televisions before the introduction of HD widescreen in the 90s and 2000s. It makes a transition to widescreen a few seconds in, so it’s likely most of the film will use the standard 16:9 aspect ratio seen in most modern movies. But 4:3 is making a comeback in recent years with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review">modern films like <em>Nickel Boys</em></a></span>, so I wouldn’t be surprised if <em>First Steps </em>had at least some segments in 4:3. The 4:3 segment shown has Pedro Pascal as Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards and Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman, giving a tour of their home in The Baxter Building, the group’s home base. It seems like a deliberate choice to portray this idyllic domesticity in 4:3, then to transition into the 16:9 aspect ratio when superhero elements like The Thing show up, creating a contrast between the two tones.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Did you know the “Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration” was introduced in a 1978 animated series to replace the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four because <em>The New Fantastic Four</em> didn’t have rights to the character? I didn’t know that until today, but it’s fascinating that the little robot assistant has such an odd history and has still managed to persist. I had my first exposure to him in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, helping him push a payload through Manhattan. Is H.E.R.B.I.E. the Harley Quinn of the Marvel universe?</p><p>Anyway, H.E.R.B.I.E. is shown with an appropriate retro-future look and is kind of giving Rosey from <em>The Jetsons</em>. He’s shown cooking with the Thing, portrayed (with the help of CGI) by <em>The Bear </em>actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach. It’s a cute scene that shows the hero is a gentle giant despite his rocky exterior. But I’m just thinking about the little robot dude. He’s trying his best. He doesn’t have taste buds to know his recipe is missing that special something.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again we’re back in 4:3, looking at what seems to be archive footage of the Fantastic Four’s foundational voyage into space. (The group’s origin story involves the four astronauts gaining their superhuman powers after exposure to cosmic rays during a mission in space.) While the MCU opted to skip Spider-Man’s origin story after bringing the character into the films a bit late, it looks like Marvel is going to explore the Fantastic Four’s beginnings to some extent in <em>First Steps</em>. We see shots of what looks like Sue’s invisibility manifesting for the first time on their spaceship, and the Thing watching old footage of himself before his skin was replaced with rocks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the Thing’s most iconic looks sees him in a trench coat and fedora, traditionally a way for the living rock man to get around incognito in the comics ever since the hero’s debut in the 60s.

It’s kind of giving Spirit Halloween, but I’m keeping an open mind. This is meant to portray a different point in history than the rest of the MCU, after all, so it makes sense that they wouldn’t look as glossy and high-tech as the rest of the heroes.</p><p>Surprisingly, we see everyone’s powers in this trailer except for Mr. Fantastic’s. Maybe the stretching limbs are at a different point in the animation process and aren’t ready for primetime. We’ll probably see him in action in the next trailer, sure to arrive sometime between now and when the movie launches on July 25.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"A lot of that transitions easily back on the PC, whereas if you make a pure PC game where you use a mouse and keyboard to control, it's really difficult to port over. So it's been designed with a controller in mind from the get-go."</p><p dir="ltr">Many survival games usually get their start on PC, and once they become popular, may then release on consoles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valheim/" data-ref-id="5000-487741">Valheim</a> is a great example of a survival game making the jump. Having a game designed with a controller in mind from the start also opens up the possibility of the game being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-steam-deck-games-to-play-right-now/2900-4083/" data-ref-id="2900-4083">playable on Steam Deck</a> or other PC handhelds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Obviously, we're releasing on PC first, right?" Ryborg said. "So that's where we'll have a good setup, but the console UX-wise, I'm not super concerned. Obviously it's all the classic tech stuff, you know, where they're [consoles] a little more limited in certain hardware things. So it needs to perform well and other tech stuff. It shouldn't be overly complicated."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being made to work well with a controller from the start, the wait for the console version of Dune: Awakening could be a long one. The PC version doesn't have an exact release date but is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-release-window-and-extensive-gameplay-look/1100-6525990/" data-ref-id="1100-6525990">slated for "early 2025,"</a> according to Funcom. That means the console version will come sometime after, perhaps later in 2025 or even sometime next year.</p>

                <p>Sending collectors' items through the mail is supposed to be safe, but it seems that one former USPS employee commandeered some of these packages for himself. Shelby Dozier pleaded guilty to theft of mail by a postal service employee, a charge that stemmed from at least 10 incidents that allegedly occurred while he was employed as a sorting clerk at a USPS office in New Jersey.</p><p dir="ltr">Between September and December of 2022, Dozier allegedly swiped the contents of at least 10 packages that were mailed to an auction house in Clifton, New Jersey. Per <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/30/former-usps-worker-stole-sports-memorabilia/78051037007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, these packages included premium items like Michael Jordan and Mickey Mantle trading cards, several dozen graded sports cards and Pokemon cards, as well as signed jerseys, signed photos, and other such memorabilia.</p><p dir="ltr">Dozier was suspected by several of his fellow employees when they noticed opened and empty parcels in the men's locker room. Law enforcement used phone records and Dozier's own employment attendance records to substantiate their suspicions, and they eventually searched his iCloud account, where they found records of sellers buying the stolen memorabilia from Dozier. Dozier's plea agreement includes $108,692.92 in restitution to his victims; though he has not been sentenced yet, the charge carries a maximum potential prison sentence of five years.</p><p dir="ltr">Trading-card theft has become increasingly common over the past few years, ostensibly because public figures like Logan Paul have boosted the profile of expensive, rare cards, especially in the Pokemon space. Back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-and-magic-card-heist-thwarted-in-dramatic-and-unexpected-fashion/1100-6527206/">October of last year</a>, two men were arrested under suspicion of stealing Magic the Gathering and Pokemon cards totaling $150,000 in value from a game store, though a portion were later recovered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/sumo-group-stops-making-original-ip-to-focus-on-partner-titles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sumo Digital is stepping away from creating its own IP, making <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">a public statement</a> that it is now going to focus “exclusively on development services for partners.”</p>
<p>The statement justifies this by saying that they need to balance “creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business”. The goal is to become “a premium development partner”, something which is very much in keeping with a good portion of the company’s work to date.</p>


<p>At this time it’s not clear the extent of any associated job losses, though they state that “Unavoidably this transition will have an impact on our studios and people. We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care, and compassion.”</p>
<p>Sumo Digital has traditionally been known for their work on other publisher IPs, their most notable games including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2009/12/19/hands-on-sonic-sega-all-stars-racing/">Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/18/littlebigplanet-3-review/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and pulling <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/14/crackdown-3-review/">Crackdown 3</a> out of development hell, but starting with 2017’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/30/snake-pass-review/">Snake Pass</a>, they also sought to produce their own IP and branch out from work-for-hire and co-development contracts – even if these provided plenty of work, such as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/21/hitman-2-review/">Hitman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review/">Forza Horizon 4 &amp; 5</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won’t see the company winding down its Secret Mode publishing label, which has generally been the home for the company’s own IP productions, including last year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/stampede-racing-royale-launches-for-free-with-a-dave-the-diver-collab/">Stampede: Racing Royale</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/deathsprint-66-is-a-buzzsaw-of-dystopian-future-racing/">DeathSprint ’66</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes The Deep</a> from subsidiary The Chinese Room. They’ve also been a broader indie publisher, though, with cute underwater adventure Loddlenaut, bike delivery game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>, and neat-and-tidy-’em-up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/11/a-little-to-the-left-review/">A Little to the Left</a>.</p>

<p>Sumo Digital was founded in 2003 in Sheffield, spending six years as a subsidiary to Foundation 9 Entertainment before regaining independence through a management buyout in 2014, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/19/british-developer-sumo-digital-acquired-by-tencent-1-3-billion/">being acquired by Tencent in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>The company has grown a huge amount in the last decade, and Sumo Group has grown to around 1,400 employees by 2023, opening up or acquiring studios in Nottingham, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/sumo-digital-have-rescued-ccps-newcastle-studio-from-closure/">Newcastle</a>, Leamington, Warrington, Pune and Bangalore. They’ve also further studios including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/14/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-devs-the-chinese-room-have-joined-sumo/">The Chinese Room</a>, Red Kit Games, Lab42, Atomhawk and more.</p>
<p>There’s uncertain times ahead, and hopefully the layoffs and disruption for such a large company – both in the UK and abroad – will be minimal.</p>

            <p>
More Xbox first-party titles have been confirmed for PS5 - and it's good news for strategy fans, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> Edition and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition both on the way. That's alongside a variety of upcoming expansion releases across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
First up is Age of Mythology: Retold Edition, a remaster of the 2002 original, which comes to PS5 on 4th March. This twist on the Age of Empires strategy formula swaps history for monsters and gods as players battle as either the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, or Atlantean pantheons.
</p>
<p>
Its 4th March arrival coincides with the launch of Age of Mythology: Retold's Immortal Pillars expansion. This includes the new Chinese pantheon, 12 new gods with unique powers and mythological units, a nine-level campaign inspired by Chinese mythology, and seven new maps. PlayStation 5 owners can pick it up alongside the base game, but it also comes to PC and Xbox on the same day. Cross-play is supported across all platforms, and all Mythology: Retold updates will hit Xbox, PS5, and PC simultaneously from this point onward.

<p>
Then, sometime this "spring", PlayStation 5 owners can get their hands on Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. This includes all the expansions released for the 1999 original, plus improved visuals, gameplay refinements, cross-play, and more. As with Age of Mythology: Retold, new DLC launches alongside Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's PlayStation 5 release, and will be available across all platforms. Microsoft isn't talking specifics yet but says to expect "fresh new content" and "new civilisations for Ranked play."
</p><p>
In other Age of Empires news, Microsoft has announced two new expansions for Age of Empires 4, both coming in 2025 and both focused on "shorter and repeatable experiences". The first of these, Knights of Cross and Rose, arrives this "spring", promising "two well-known armies inspired by history" plus a "solo mode that will challenge even the most skilled strategists." Additional details can be found in <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/">Microsoft's announcement</a>.

It continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">multi-console release strategy</a> Microsoft's announced last year - one that's so far seen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment come to PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 all on the way.

The start of 2025 also brought reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">suggesting Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator are PS5-bound.</a> Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.

			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-sims-25-birthday" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Electronic Arts</a> is celebrating 25 iconic years of The Sims. This life simulation title has brought people to gaming that typically wouldn't go near games, allowing people to share their creativity and revel in the chaos and madness of Sims. It went from a very humble title with Comic Sans writing to one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time, with a million-lifetime players to date.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of The Sims, there have been some major drops, as well as news regarding updates coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-4-creator-kits-are-available-november-14-new-behind-the-scenes-revealed/">The Sims 4</a>. First and foremost, The Sims 1 and Sims 2 were released as part of a Birthday Bundle celebration. While this news was exciting to most long-term Sims players, there have already been a host of issues, with the games just either not booting or constantly crashing. As a result, it's led to a frustrated community, with many of them refunding the games. The issues have been acknowledged, with the team dedicated to fixing them in future updates.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you want to try your luck, The Sims and The Sims 2 are available via the EA app, Epic Games Store, and Steam for PCs running Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 will also be getting a major base game update today, which adds 70 new in-game items for all players to enjoy, as well as a special event named The Sims 4 Blast From the Past Event. This will take you through a journey of nostalgia and memories while unlocking new items and content in your game by participating in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play The Sims FreePlay, there are special events to participate in with rewards, as well as 25 days of in-game gifts, which include some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history.</p>
<p>In the event you want some<a href="https://shopthesims.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tangible merch</a> that you can showcase in your day-to-day life, there is a limited edition merch collection that features retro pins, a 2000s-themed gamer mat, t-shirts, and more.</p>
<p>For the official 25th anniversary, which is today, a 25-hour live stream is beginning on The Sims YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok channels, where you'll be able to see 25 hours of gameplay, giveaways, and more. This includes people like Doja Cat, Trixie Mattel, Ironmouse, Julien, and more. The live stream will begin at 2 PM PST / 5 PM ET / 10 P GMT. The graphic above showcases the names of the people that will be appearing in the 25-hour stream.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up The Legacy Collection for old-time's sake?</p>

So when I game on my PC, I’ve naturally defaulted to using a PlayStation controller for familiarity and comfort. But after using the GameSir Tarantula Pro for a while, I’m not sure I can go back. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s not that it’s the best controller on the market, either (though it’s no slouch). Rather, the gamepad is so damn comfortable to use that it feels like GameSir might as well have taken a mold of my hands to make the Tarantula Pro. I’ve had trouble returning to a DualSense pad since using it.</p><h2 id="h226139"><a id=""></a>The GameSir Tarantula Pro is a symmetrical stick delight</h2><p>I grew up as a PlayStation kid, so I have an affinity for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symmetrical (in-line) sticks</a></span> on my controllers. I was an especially big fan of the DualShock 4 for this reason. But despite having big hands, the PS5's DualSense has always felt slightly too bulky for me, as if my fingers never quite land in the right spot without holding the controller just a bit unnaturally. The moment I laid hands on the GameSir Tarantula Pro, however, it felt like returning home after a long trip away.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable difference for me is how my index fingers rest on the Xbox-style LT/RT triggers on the top of the controller much more naturally than they do with a DualSense controller. When you factor in how easy it is to swap them to hair triggers for even faster response time, it’s made FPS games feel better to play than ever before. There are even two customizable buttons on the back of the controller that sit in the perfect spot for my middle fingers to use—but nearby switches can retract them when not in use, allowing them to sit flush with the rest of the controller’s back. It’s a dream.</p><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t just comfortable, though. At only $69.99, it’s also an affordable entry point for folks seeking a “pro” controller. Here’s a basic rundown of my favorite features:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>It works on PC or Switch </strong>and features mechanically interchangeable buttons to accommodate which of the two platforms you’re using it on at the time. </li><li><strong>It works on iOS/Android</strong>.</li><li>There are two customizable back buttons that feel great to use.</li><li>I’ve seen solid battery life out of it so far, and there are no signs of that slowing down.</li><li>It has multiple trigger modes, each having a purpose based on the type of game you’re playing.</li></ul><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t perfect, however. It may be extremely comfortable to hold, but it trades affordability for a bland visual style and a build quality that doesn’t feel quite as premium as its feature set. Also, so much of its functionality is trapped behind button combination shortcuts that it feels like you need a journal to keep up with them all. Oh, and it’s kind of a bummer that you have to shell out an extra $10 for a version with a charging stand.</p><p>There’s no shortage of controllers to choose from these days—especially on PC—and the best choice for you is the one that has all of the features you need at a price you can afford. Though it might lack some features that more hardcore, sweaty pro players might desire, the comfort and functionality of the Tarantula Pro makes it an excellent choice, especially for casual gaming where comfort might be the most valued trait. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Once you’ve got a few hours into Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, you’ll find yourself revelling in pomp and circumstance at a wedding in Semine. This is one of the pivotal moments of this open-world RPG, but it has a particular task that might be tricky for some.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the wedding mission, you’re prompted to congratulate the newlyweds, but the bride and groom are nowhere to be seen. This can leave you searching for a while, as the location they’re in is not at all obvious – and you might never think to look there.</p>



<p>In this short guide, I’ll help you find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-find-the-bride-and-groom-in-kingdom-come">Find the Bride and Groom in Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>The wedding mission is one of the highlights of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. It’s the culmination of several hours of gameplay, and hopefully, you’ll be well-prepared to deal with everything it offers. In one moment, you’ll be duelling guards, and in the next, you’ll be procuring special alcohol for Moravian guests.</p>



<p>It’s a busy time.</p>



<p>At the end of the mission, you prepare to leave the wedding, but first, Henry of Skalitz wants to congratulate the newlyweds, but they’ve disappeared and nobody knows where they are.</p>



<p>Here’s where you’ll find the <strong>bride</strong> (Agnes) at the wedding:</p>



<p>Head away from the ceremony area through the arch leading to the dining area – nearby where the Moravian crew is sitting. Directly ahead of you will be a dead-end with a door to the left, with a guard posted outside. If you head in there, you’ll see it leads into a wine and beer cellar – it’s in here that you’ll find the bride.</p>



<p>If you’ve come here previously with the Moravian task, you’ll already have evacuated the strict guard from inside. Otherwise, you might need to distract him some other way. Either way, this is where to find the newlyweds in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil what happens when you’ve found the bride – have fun!</p>

It’s set in a dark fantasy world in which, once a year, a powerful being called the Paintress wakes and paints a number on her monolith. When she does, everyone of that age vanishes from the earth. As the game kicks off, the Paintress is going to wake soon and paint the number 33. You plays as Expedition 33, a group of 33-year-olds who plan to kill the Paintress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat sounds like a real selling point for the game. It’s turn-based, but you do a lot of other things besides choosing attacks for your expeditioners. You can dodge, parry, and counter incoming attacks. You can chain combos together by pressing buttons in a rhythm, and you can use a free-aim system to target enemy weak points. It looks pretty cool.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pga-tour-2k25-the-final-preview.1100127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you took a Family Feud-style survey of which pro sports simulation video game series people would most want 2K to take a crack at that they’re not already making, a resurrection of NFL 2K would easily be the number-one answer. Heck, pro golf might not even be the second or third answer (hello, MLB and NHL). But the company is nevertheless returning for a third round with PGA Tour 2K25, and after playing for a couple of hours, there’s a lot to like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, developer HB Studios has been honing its golf game for quite a while now, having made The Golf Club starting a decade ago before signing on with 2K and rebranding to PGA Tour 2K in 2020. The team’s experience and maturity shine through in 2K25, as I had a hard time finding any glaring issues in my hands-on. Is it the best-looking sports game? No. Would it be nice to have more real-life courses? Sure. (2K25 does bring the PGA Championship, US Open, and the Open Championship.) Was the framerate surprisingly choppy on PC when I’d press Y to survey each new hole? Yup. But actually digging into this year’s offering was just fun.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It started with the upgraded EvoSwing mechanic. You have a few different options, and playing with a controller, I preferred the right stick option, in which you pull down to wind up, and press forward to strike the ball and follow through. You can set this to be forgiving, or it can be set to be very much not forgiving with the higher difficulty settings, whereby an errant flick of your thumb in one direction or another might yield a wicked slice or hook. Conversely, there are also lower difficulty settings (Perfect Swing) for those just looking to have a chill, stress-free time, in which 2K25 isn’t as punitive on missed inputs in an effort to try and keep you moving and advancing. Furthermore, you can tap LB to shape your shots, giving you additional control over where the ball will go. HB Studios also says the ball physics have been improved, and I like that you can also move laterally in the tee box to adjust your tee shot if, say, a tree up ahead gets slightly in the way of your preferred drive. It certainly helped that I started by playing as Tiger Woods, this year’s cover athlete, who as we all know is pretty darn good at this sport.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I got offered a role in a movie with Christopher “Shooter McGavin” McDonald – who, yes, is in the game, albeit not as his famous Happy Gilmore character for obvious licensing reasons.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, MyCareer has been given a boost, implementing narrative mechanics we’ve seen in other sports games to reasonably entertaining effect. I got offered a role in a movie with Christopher “Shooter McGavin” McDonald – who, yes, is in the game, albeit not as his famous Happy Gilmore character for obvious licensing reasons – where I could choose to play a hero or villain, and my choice would affect which MyCareer stats got boosted. Gear earned by cashing in your earned VC will also affect your stats, while your skills are also upgradeable by playing and, naturally, winning. The developers have also added Quests, which are broad goals they can refresh weekly or really whenever, such as getting 10 birdies in a row.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for MyPlayer, I didn’t want to spend my entire demo time trying to recreate a perfect facsimile of myself, but even noodling around with the player creator for a few minutes was enough to get me reasonably close. You’ve got skill trees to dig into now as well, which is a welcome upgrade. Sadly, I didn’t get to try the multiplayer options, which sound like good casual fun including ranked matchmaking and cross-platform Societies (think: groups or clubs). I have fond memories of shooting the breeze with my friends in Links 2004 for the original Xbox, and what PGA Tour 2K25 promises sounds like it might recreate all of that and more. I appreciate that there are also asynchronous multiplayer options if you and your buddies live in wildly different time zones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PGA Tour 2K25 is admittedly a bit difficult to preview in that it seems to do everything reasonably well without faceplanting in any one single area. It makes it a bit tough to get excited about, admittedly, but it does seem like a solid bet to be worth picking up for golf fans and/or those looking for a low-stress game. Fortunately, you can check it out for yourself without spending a dime, as a playable demo of PGA Tour 2K25 is available as of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Breakout Beyond is a twist on Atari's brick-breaker, keeping the same paddle-and-ball setup but having it all move sideways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Choice Provisions, the studio behind the BIT.TRIP series, Breakout Beyond has a sideways progression path as players move left-to-right. Breaking bricks is still the objective, and as combos ramp up lights and effects intensify.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Special bricks can flip on some fantastic effects too, ranging from massive explosions to an actual laser cannon. 72 levels are planned for Breakout Beyond, alongside an unlockable endless mode with an online global leaderboard. If you don't want to break bricks alone, Breakout Beyond also has local two-player co-op as an option.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Breakout Beyond was originally set to be an exclusive game for the Intellivision Amico back in 2020, but Atari has since agreed to acquire and complete development of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're thrilled to be able to bring this gem to our players," Atari's senior director of games publishing Ethan Stearns said. "The team thought it was a brilliant concept, preserving the heart of Breakout's gameplay while also giving the formula a completely new spin.

While it is unknown what Portal could include in the next Battlefield game, Flakfire said developers told him that Portal could be one of the features that players test in the Battlefield Labs program.</p><p>At the time of 2042's initial release, publisher <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/game-overview/modes/battlefield-portal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts called Battlefield Portal</a> a "love letter" to the franchise's fans. While the feature provided players and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-2042-review-character-development/1900-6417785/" data-ref-id="1900-6417785">reviewers</a> with a rush of nostalgia at launch, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/1fums63/battlefield_portal_was_such_a_huge_missed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fan reception to the mode</a> became more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield2042/comments/17cjgy9/whats_even_the_point_of_portal_anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lukewarm in recent years</a>.</p><p>At least prospective players of Battlefield 6 may have the opportunity to have a say in what the next iteration of Battlefield Portal looks like if they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a>.

EA said it is resolving the technical issues, and the first Battlefield Labs test sessions are due to begin "in the coming weeks."</p>

		<p>Following the mixed reception to its launch last week, a second hotfix update is now available for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> on PC, as Nixxes look to address the main pain points that users have felt with the port.</p>
<p>In particular they’ve sought to stamp out crashes and stability issues as much as possible – though they also hazard that you really, really should update your drivers to the very latest version to have Spider-Man 2 compatibility built in.</p>


<p>Beyond that, they’ve fixed an Achievements bug that was causing them to fail – this will work retroactively upon loading a save file – and fixed a DualShock 4 button prompt bug.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Spider-Man 2 PC v1.202.0.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Achievements not being awarded on some configurations.</li>
<li>Triangle and Square button prompts are now displayed correctly when using a DualShock 4 controller with Steam Input enabled.</li>
<li>Resolved a frame rate related bug that could block players during the mission ‘Show Me New York’.</li>
</ul>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve been playing with our PCs and generally found that the game has been fine following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/500563872868991406">the first hotfix last Friday</a>, both in terms of stability and performance. Hopefully the game quickly gets up to snuff for those that are running into problems.</p>

			<p>The developers of Age of Empires have announced today that there will be new content coming to multiple games, as well as their exciting announcement of the franchise reaching 60 million players worldwide.</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest news, though, is that both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-might-be-coming-to-playstation/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> will be released on Sony's PlayStation 5. This is in line with other Microsoft titles (the Forza Horizon 5 announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landed&nbsp;just a few days ago</a>), of course, but it is still something we're not used to seeing. Age of Empires has been, after all, one of the very first Microsoft gaming franchises.</p>
<p>Age of Mythology: Retold will land on PlayStation 5 alongside the Immortal Pillars expansion, which will be released on March 4. This expansion will introduce the Chinese pantheon, as well as new maps to explore, myth units, and added gameplay features. For those who want to get their hands on this expansion, pre-orders are now live. Those who own Age of Mythology: Retold - Premium Edition will automatically receive the expansion on day one.</p>
<p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition will launch on PlayStation 5 later in the Spring. When both titles are released, they will feature content parity across all platforms, as well as cross-play support. This title is currently available on Microsoft Store (and Xbox Game Pass) and Steam.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PS5_ageofmythology_key_art.webp"></a></figure>

<p>In addition to these two games being released for PlayStation, it's been confirmed by the developers that new content will be released for Age of Empires IV this year. It will receive two pieces of DLC in 2025, with the first one launching this Spring. The first DLC will be titled "Knights of Cross and Rose" and will give players the opportunity to lead two well-known armies that are inspired by history. It will also introduce a new solo. More information regarding the second DLC will be shared at a later date, most likely once the first DLC has been released.</p>
<p>For those who play Age of Empires Mobile, February will be a big month for you. There are new features and events to participate in, including a new campaign named Battle of Dawn, as well as a new event named Stellar Glory. For Valentine's Day, Age of Empires Mobile will be getting exclusive Valentine's Day cosmetics, as well as three events to participate in that are themed around Princess Josephine's Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p>More information and screenshots are available on the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Age of Empires website</a>, so you can see what the game will look like with the introduction of the new content in all games. There is also some concept art available to look at, as well as a gift code for those who play Age of Empires Mobile.</p>
