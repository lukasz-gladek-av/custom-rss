			<p>Pathea Games has announced that the next game in the "My Time" series will be titled My Time At Evershine. This game follows on from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a> and My Time at Sandrock. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> will launch on September 24 for this game. My Time At Evershine is the first confirmed game to be announced for the Nintendo Switch 2 and will be released on platforms such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>"My Time at Sandrock cost a lot, like $12-million-a-lot, and still counting, we expect Evershine's budget to be somewhere in the ballpark as well," explained Zifei Wu, My Time series Creative Director. "Having extra funding at this early stage of development allows us to plan for bigger and better features, and allows the community to give us direct feedback while we're still deciding key elements of the game's design and execution."</p>
<p>My Time at Evershine is said to be the most adventurous and immersive installment in the series, claiming to redefine the life-simulation genre. This game is set to appeal to fans of RPGs as well as life-simulation fans, as it contains deep role-playing elements such as meaningful character progression and plenty of quests.</p>
<p>The game is set to build on all of the beloved features from the first two games, taking the game in a new art direction, revamping gameplay mechanics, and adding a cast of romanceable characters. In total, My Time at Evershine is set to be a 40-plus-hour narrative with exploration, questing, and a new feature of town management.</p>
<p>Instead of being a builder like players were in My Time at Portia and My Time at Sandrock, players will instead be undertaking the role of the Governor, where they become the city's key figure. You get to manage other characters and delegate tasks to them while feeling more relaxed as you watch your city grow and develop around you.</p>
<p>My Time at Evershine is Pathea Games' most ambitious project yet. For the first time, it will feature multiplayer cooperative play, allowing players to play through the campaign in solo or co-op mode with up to four players. In addition, it will feature full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer, allowing players to customize and create content to expand their game experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reveal Trailer | My Time at Evershine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubgnFCW2m3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They released a reveal trailer for the game to show players what they will be getting into if they choose to purchase My Time at Evershine or support the Kickstarter. It's only 49 seconds long, but it showcases the new mature art style that will be utilized in the game and some of the gameplay features players can expect to dive into.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wildkeepers Rising Preview - A Bullet Heaven with Helpers]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wildkeepers-rising-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildkeepers-rising-preview-a-bullet-heaven-with-helpers.983118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wildkeepers-rising-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're in an age of exploration for the bullet heaven genre -- you know, games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Halls of Torment. </em>It's a genre bursting with popularity, so it's to be expected we'd encounter fresh and original spins on this concept. Such is the case with <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>, an upcoming bullet heaven that's an addicting mix of some of gaming's most popular franchises.</p>
<p>The secret ingredient to the <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> recipe is monster collecting. Developer Lioncode Games likens it as a potent combo of <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon"><em>Pokemon</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. While you take control of your player character, you'll amass a team of monsters to fight by your side, each with their own unique identity, behaviors, and abilities.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> - A New Take on <em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>
<p>These thoughts are all based on a hands-off presentation, but I'm definitely excited to actually get my hands on it. <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> operates like your typical bullet heaven. The player controls a character that aims on its own, and you're supposed to avoid droves of vicious monsters. As you level up, you grow more powerful and choose various upgrades upon leveling up.</p>
<p>This is also where monsters come in, which is likely going to be the main hook for players looking to try out this game. With around 18 total monsters so far and more to come during development, leveling up at certain points allows you to choose a monster to add to your team. These will change the course of battle in various ways, but the main thing I want to emphasize is each monster has a role.</p>
<p>DPS, tank, and support -- the trio of MMORPG roles. This is also how monsters are split in <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>, meaning you're not focusing on just pure damage. Some are ranged attackers, other are melee tanks. One monster, the Kiraboom, is an exploding cat. It's fast and does a lot of damage, but has to recover after exploding.</p>

<p>Vastly different from the Kiraboom is Glacier, a tanky brute of a monster that charges in and deals ice damage to enemies. And even differing from both of those is Splizz, a spider-like critter that stuns enemies with its mesmerizing tail.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, mixing and matching a team of four monsters, each with their own abilities, upgrades upon level-ups, and even special abilities the player can trigger... well, there's a lot of potential, and perhaps even nuance to the gameplay.</p>
<p>As for the creature collecting aspect, in truth, the commonality between <em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>and <em>Pokemon</em> is a bit flimsy, but that doesn't mean it isn't promising. I was initially a bit disappointed by the fact that you're not actively going out and collecting a plethora of monsters; instead, you have a choice of monsters to use when you level up at certain points, as I mentioned before.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>Has More Than Just the Grind</h2>
<p>Here's what I find most intriguing about <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>: its storyline and world. There's a full campaign in this game, along with multiple characters you can unlock, each with its own story arcs. Levels have objectives, so it's not <em>just </em>survive for 30 minutes and hope for the best.</p>
<p>It also doesn't seem like a game you have to put dozens upon dozens of hours into unless you absolutely want to; in fact, the current plan is to have around 15-20 hours of content. So rather than focusing on an endless loop of dopamine, you have a concise story that should leave you satisfied upon completion.</p>
<p>To facilitate this more story-centric structure, the maps are hand-made and very deliberate. The environments will have various choke points and I assume areas points of interest that are crafted to test the skills of the player. On top of that, you'll find various items around the map, adding another layer to the gameplay on top of your character's ability and your creatures'.</p>

<p>The developers split items into categories: damage, power, game-changers, and wildcards. I want to focus on the latter two, because this is another aspect in which <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> can set itself apart from the competition. Game-changers are said to give new mechanics like slowing down time. Sure, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> has that, but again, this is all on top of the abilities of your Wildkeeper and their companions.</p>
<p>Wildcards, on the other hand, are described as "completely crazy items" that'll drastically change the game. One example was the ability to clone a guardian, sharing its health pool with the original. That sounds mighty powerful, and definitely has potential to turn the game on its head.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There are plenty of new bullet heaven games coming out every month, and, well, creature collecting games for that matter. Still, we haven't seen this mix of the two before, so <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> has a lot of potential to hook players. Everything looks great on paper, but the true test will be to see how it actually plays. Needless to say, I'll be first in line to see if Lioncode Games can deliver!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-casual-mode-new-animations-and-more.983115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's aimed at those who've been finding the base game a little too tricky, although it's also bringing new animations and lots more.</p>
<p>Although previous updates have been aimed at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-nerf-dragonsplague">altering game mechanics</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-available-now-on-ps5-and-steam-includes-new-game-option-and-more">introducing extra options</a>, this one's bringing a whole new difficulty mode with it, and it should make your time adventuring in the game's open world a bit easier.</p>
<p>Casual Mode introduces a host of modifiers designed to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>a bit less taxing. Ferrystones cost less, for instance, as do inn fees, and it's more difficult for your character to become encumbered with Heavy or Very Heavy weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-spell.jpg?itok=K9SfBSJM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-spell.jpg?itok=DQX0qrOb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a new difficulty mode to make things a bit easier.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also use less stamina when you dash outside of combat, and your loss gauge won't go up if you die and choose to load from your last saved game.</p>
<p>What's more, dragonsplague, which is arguably one of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s most controversial mechanics, will now be a bit easier to manage; pawns won't suffer a "devastating calamity" when recovering from it, even if the symptoms become terminal.</p>
<p>If you choose to play in Casual Mode, you won't be able to switch back to Normal Mode, although you can switch from Normal to Casual any time you like. Some achievements or trophies won't be attainable in Casual Mode, either.</p>
<p>Even if you don't plan to play in Casual Mode, however, there are still lots of other things being added as part of this update, and most of them aren't limited to the new difficulty mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-riftstone.jpg?itok=03_dZ0Yi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-riftstone.jpg?itok=ERfcg44u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Please don't have dragonsplague, please don't have dragonsplague..."</figcaption></figure><p>Other big changes include a new Portcrystal in Bakbattahl, new animations for pawns when idling or dashing, and infinite revivals for your main pawn from Forgotten Riftstones, among other things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/day-of-doom-mode-now-available-in-fortnite/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v31-20-stop-doctor-doom-in-day-of-doom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle Royale v31.20</a>, players can participate in <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-able-to-run-on-ipad-out-of-the-eu-using-brute-force/">Fortnite</a>'s latest game mode, "Day of Doom." In this game mode, players can team up with Marvel's Avengers and work to halt Doctor Doom's conquest. This game mode is inspired by the Endgame LTM from Battle Royale Chapter 1 Season 8. For anyone wanting to participate in the Day of Doom game mode, it will be in Discover until October 4 at 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 2 PM BST.</p>
<p>Up to 32 players can participate in the Day of Doom Fortnite game mode, where players can split up into two teams: Doom's Henchmen and Allies of the Avengers. This allows you to decide whether to be the hero or the villain during your time in the event.</p>
<p>For those who play as Doom's henchmen, you have to work to collect six Arcane Artifacts. Once collected, the Avengers will no longer be able to respawn. The first henchman to collect an Arcane Artifact will then be transformed into Doom's Chosen, where the player becomes unstoppable, wears Doom's armor, and utilizes catastrophic abilities. Additionally, the rest of Doom's henchmen will join the match and immediately have access to strong weaponry, such as Doctor Doom's Arcane Gauntlets.</p>
<p>Those who want to save the day will be part of the Avengers and have to team up with the Island's strongest heroes to take down all of Doom's henchmen before they collect all six Arcane Artifacts. Compared to the Avengers, the henchmen have a big pool of respawns. To win as the Avengers, you must defeat Doom's henchmen, including Doom's chosen. Every respawn, the Avengers in the Day of Doom event will be given one of four randomly assigned loadouts based on a different Avenger.</p>
<p>Aside from the Day of Doom event in Fortnite, there are also the Stark Mobile Armories that fall from the sky in Battle Royale and Zero Build. The airborne armory comes in two designs: Iron Man or War Machine.</p>
<p>Once you have gone inside the armories, you can get yourself some futuristic gear by interacting with the Iron Man Armor Stand, which will either give you items pertaining to Iron Man's kit or War Machine's kit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Iron Man appears in the shop, with players able to get hold of cosmetics such as the Iron Man Mk 45 Outfit, the Energy Collector Back Bling, Mark 45 Bass, and more. Of course, there are also Iron Man cosmetics for the Fortnite Lego if that is more your style.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team17-says-2024-releases-brought-in-less-than-10-of-revenue.983055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Worms&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hell Let Loose&nbsp;</em>publisher Team17 has released its financial report for the six months ending June 30th, and it looks like the studio is pretty heavily reliant on its back catalog for income right now.</p>
<p>In Team17's <a href="https://www.team17groupplc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/H124-Results-presentation-FINAL-ex-SR.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial results presentation</a>, the studio says that just 8% of its revenue in the first six months of 2024 came from new releases, constituting around £6 million (roughly $8 million).</p>
<p>By contrast, 92% of Team17's revenue, amounting to about £74 million (that's around $98 million), for this period came from back catalog releases, which essentially means any game released prior to January this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/team17-financials-classified-france-44.jpg?itok=d2MSbQzR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/team17-financials-classified-france-44.jpg?itok=JIS6OZy6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Team17's release slate this year includes the tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Classified: France '44</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio puts this down to "a competitive market with a tough FY23 comparator", likely indicating that Team17's 2023 release schedule was stronger for the first half of the year; it did, after all, include cozy horror game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dredge"><em>Dredge</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trepang2-release-date-mails-love-letter-to-00s-shooters-in-june">2000s shooter tribute</a>&nbsp;<em>Trepang2</em>.</p>
<p>Team17's back catalog, however, "performed very well", according to the studio. Back catalog sales were up 30% in the first half of 2024, apparently driven by "excellent lifecycle management and consumer behavior", according to the presentation.</p>
<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>Dredge&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trepang2&nbsp;</em>both now constitute part of Team17's back catalog, as does last November's&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, which I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blasphemous-2-review-second-verse">reviewed for this very site</a>. These games, as well as others, "delivered strong performances", Team17 says.</p>
<p>According to Team17, the first six months of 2024 evidenced "lower expensed development and marketing costs" for the studio, with a "significant reduction in expensed development costs" happening due to "studio cost restructuring and ongoing cost controls".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blasphemous-2-team17-financials.jpg?itok=S1Hh1FK_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blasphemous-2-team17-financials.jpg?itok=jieg__h0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blasphemous 2&nbsp;</em>is now part of Team17's back catalog.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to its future, Team17 says it will "double down" on its "indie focus", and that it will also "prioritize evergreen franchises", which makes sense given the disproportionate sales impact of its back catalog so far this year.</p>
<p>You're also going to see <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-acquires-bus-simulator-21-developer-astragon">more mergers and acquisitions</a> from Team17, as well as a "sharpened greenlight process". We'll have to wait and see what all this means in practical terms, but in the meantime, you can read Team17's <a href="https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/team17/news/rns_widget/story/wv37z3r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full half-year financial report here</a> if you wish.</p>

            <p>I started playing and enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a> wizarding sim Spellbreak just in time for Spellbreak to get shut down. Developers Proletariat, Inc announced plans to yank the servers back in August 2022 in the course of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-acquire-spellbreak-studio-to-focus-on-world-of-warcraft-expansions">acquired by Activision Blizzard</a>, bringing an end to many happy hours spent skating on conjured ice ramps and hurling boulders around like bunny rabbits. Yes, I am the kind of wizard who hurls a bunny rabbit, if there are no boulders to spare.</p>
<p>Happily, it transpires that Proletariat have resurrected their creation and handed it over to posterity in the shape of a free standalone Community Version, <a href="https://sbcommunity.itch.io/spellbreak-community-version">available on Itch.io</a>. You’ll need to host your own server or join another group if you want to play multiplayer, but all the same, this is a lovely gift and one I’m delighted to transmit unto you, the active and efficient Magenauts of Rockus Paperus Shottegonne.</p><!--more-->

<p>This isn’t strictly speaking “news”, I'll grant you, inasmuch as it is not new. The Community Version released way back in December 2022, months before I joined RPS as a full-time Scuttlebutt Conjurer. I've only just stumbled on it <a href="https://x.com/DominicTarason/status/1835788217066328209">care of</a> former RPS Scuttlebutt Conjurer Dominic Tarason. You might accordingly accuse me of being “bad at my job”, but I would immediately retort that a wizard is never late, nor is he early – he arrives precisely when he means to, and also, if you don’t shaddap I’m going to sock you right in the kisser with an electric tornado.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played Spellbreak, here’s a quick summary: it’s got the usual battle royale premise of a large, multiple-biome map with people competing for power-ups and gear drops while racing to the centre, but it spices things up with, well, magic. As in Magicka – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a>! My beloved - you can combine spells of different elements to produce some properly apocalyptic whizbangs. It’s also very fast. These ain’t your classic octogenarian warlocks in heavy, star-spangled dressing gowns. They’re hot young people who zip about like ninjas.</p>
<p>If you’ve downloaded the Community Version, and you’re looking for opponents and advice, the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/elemental-fracture-1023813169124221009">Elemental Fracture discord</a> seems quite populous.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/atari-50-game-history-adventure-centipede-2600-5200-1849841460&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/atari-50-game-history-adventure-centipede-2600-5200-1849841460">Digital Eclipse’s <em>Atari 50</em></a></span>, a compilation of games from across that company’s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>UF0 50</em></a></span>, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There’s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets <em>UFO 50 </em>apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.<br></p><p>That’s right, <em>UFO 50 </em>is, for lack of a better term, a “fictional” game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games–not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences–from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (<em>Spelunky</em>), Jon Perry (<em>Air Land &amp; Sea</em>), and musician Eirik Suhrke (<em>Hotline Miami</em>) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it’s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you’ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation’s opening as “the UFO 50 Recovery Team.” In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone’s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. “Whenever possible,” we are told, “the integrity of the original software was preserved.”<br></p><p>The 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game, <em>Barbuta</em> (“Developed secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,” an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre <em>Cyber Owls</em>, “launched alongside an original comic book series.” At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.<br></p><p>And this, in my view, is essential to what makes <em>UFO 50 </em>so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, “We know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we’re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!” There’s none of that here in <em>UFO 50</em>. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren’t beholden to what everyone else was doing.<br></p><p><em>Barbuta</em>, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while <em>Cyber Owls </em>feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console’s power. (Similarly, it doesn’t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn’t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you’ll find one-to-one clones of the era’s hits. There isn’t UFO Soft’s take on <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. here, though you’ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I’d dive into a game and say, “Oh, cool, this feels like it’s riffing on <em>Blaster Master</em>,” or “Okay, I can definitely see elements of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cEcxgPvmQqU?si=jIjrcEV1yKl2UB0M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cEcxgPvmQqU?si=jIjrcEV1yKl2UB0M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Space Taxi</em></a></span><em> </em>here,” but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-recommend-id="image://8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Who knows what mysteries are lurking in the depths of Valbrace’s dungeon?</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-recommend-id="image://8bb412f191d26cbbec311fca2a312a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The hero recoils as struck by an orc’s club in a moment from Valbrace." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To give you a quick sense of the breadth of what’s on offer here, I’m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with <em>UFO 50</em>. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I’ve played about ten hours of <em>UFO 50 </em>in all, so to say that I’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s available here is an understatement.) The one that’s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is <em>Valbrace</em>, a tough action-RPG released, the game’s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven’t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I’m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon’s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It’s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. <em>Valbrace </em>has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.<br></p><p>Next, there’s <em>Rail Heist</em>, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it. It’s simultaneously strategic and kinetic, a real blast.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a1ee6a124318bba47d4b84c99d1d4eaa" data-recommend-id="image://a1ee6a124318bba47d4b84c99d1d4eaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cute, squat red and blue units in medieval battle garb face off in a screenshot from Attactics." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cute, squat red and blue units in medieval battle garb face off in a screenshot from Attactics." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Units relentlessly advance toward the opposing castle in the fast-paced Attactics.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1ee6a124318bba47d4b84c99d1d4eaa" data-recommend-id="image://a1ee6a124318bba47d4b84c99d1d4eaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cute, squat red and blue units in medieval battle garb face off in a screenshot from Attactics." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Attactics </em>is a fast-paced real-time tactics game for people like me who often avoid tactics games. Units from two opposing castles march toward each other automatically, but you can frantically grab your own units and slide them into advantageous formations to better withstand and conquer the enemy onslaught.<br></p><p><em>Porgy </em>is a gorgeous undersea adventure in which you pilot an adorable little submarine (with eyes!) to find upgrades and solve a mystery. The world is filled with both dangers (giant shark attacks!) and secrets just waiting to be discovered. </p><figure id="" data-id="7285bb068e19a96ff16d696a6460aa3e" data-recommend-id="image://7285bb068e19a96ff16d696a6460aa3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blue-clad figure faces a military base occupied by enemy forces in a screenshot from Cyber Owls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue-clad figure faces a military base occupied by enemy forces in a screenshot from Cyber Owls." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Cabal-style shooting missions are just one type of gameplay in Cyber Owls.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mossmouth</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7285bb068e19a96ff16d696a6460aa3e" data-recommend-id="image://7285bb068e19a96ff16d696a6460aa3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blue-clad figure faces a military base occupied by enemy forces in a screenshot from Cyber Owls." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, the aforementioned <em>Cyber Owls </em>is a fitting game to close out <em>UFO 50</em>’s chronology. Ostensibly released in 1989 and the “final” game in this compilation, <em>Cyber Owls </em>shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one’s a beat-em-up, one’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmncTQi7Me0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmncTQi7Me0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cabal</em></a></span>-style shooter, one’s a <em>Metal Gear</em>-esque stealth mission, and one’s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it’s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue’s gallery on a show that fused <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </em>with <em>G.I. Joe</em>, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.<br></p><p>And yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here–just one tenth of the entire library–is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing <em>UFO 50</em>. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There’s a game with <em>Smash T.V.</em>-style arena shooting. There’s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to <em>Shadowgate </em>or <em>Deja Vu</em>. There’s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There’s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There’s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character’s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of <em>UFO 50</em>, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.<br></p><p>Playing <em>UFO 50 </em>feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents’ house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you’ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You’re probably not going to love all of them, but that’s actually good, I would argue. <em>UFO 50 </em>would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with <em>someone</em>, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There’s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There’s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)<br></p><p>And while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, <em>UFO 50 </em>is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren’t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming’s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It’s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It’s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we’re just getting started.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p> Alternate history strategy title Ara: History Untold will then make its Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass debut on <strong>24th September</strong>. This is another day one release for PC players, and can be pre-installed today.</p>
<p>"Ara: History Untold is an evolution in historical grand strategy, featuring beloved classic PC strategy mechanics alongside innovative gameplay," reads the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/17/xbox-game-pass-september-2024-wave-2/">official blurb</a>. "Build a nation and lead your people throughout history as you explore new lands, develop arts and culture, conduct diplomacy, and go head-to-head with your rivals to prove you are the greatest ruler ever known.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA announced that its DLSS 3 technology will be featured in four of the biggest PC game releases out this week.</p>
<p>Square Enix's Final Fantasy XVI, which will be launched in just a few hours on Steam, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation</a>, DLAA, and Reflex. If you're planning to play on your own PC, make sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-released-supports-final-fantasy-xvi-god-of-war-ragnarok-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the latest optimized Game Ready driver</a>. If you prefer the cloud, Final Fantasy XVI is also playable via GeForce NOW, and DLSS 3 is supported there for GFN Ultimate subscribers.</p>
<p>At 4K resolution and with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, the GeForce RTX 4090 averages 173 frames per second in Final Fantasy XVI, while the RTX 4080 SUPER registered 134 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER stops at 118 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER at 105 FPS.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other major launch of the week is Sony Santa Monica's God of War: Ragnarok, due on Thursday, September 19. Once again, DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex are all supported. DLAA isn't there, but there are unofficial ways to add it. According to NVIDIA, DLSS 3 lets you play God of War: Ragnarok at nearly 200 frames per second (4K resolution with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode) with a 2X performance boost if you own a GeForce RTX 4090. The RTX 4080 SUPER gets nearly 160 FPS, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is almost at 140 FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER is almost at 120.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is also scheduled to be released on September 19. Powered by the RE Engine, the remaster offers the same NVIDIA feature set as God of War: Ragnarok.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Enotria: The Last Song, the Soulslike game developed by Jyamma Games and inspired by Italian folklore, also supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 and Reflex. The game described as 'Summer Souls' debuted yesterday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-fully-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has fully revealed&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>, the third game in the&nbsp;<em>My Time&nbsp;</em>series, and it comes complete with a new art style, city management elements, and more.</p>
<p><i>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</i>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-pathea-games">teased a couple of weeks ago</a>, but today, Pathea has revealed more information about what the game will actually be, and the studio says it's designed to "appeal to both life simulation fans and RPG enthusiasts".</p>
<p>The studio is promising a 40-hour storyline "brimming with exploration", as well as a "diverse cast of romanceable characters" and "revamped gameplay mechanics", so if you were expecting a low-effort sequel to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock"><em>My Time at Sandrock</em></a>, it looks like you'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=8t9G11E0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-reveal-combat.jpg?itok=e8gcSMuy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will feature "deep role-playing elements", according to Pathea.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Sandrock&nbsp;</em>and its predecessor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-portia"><em>My Time at Portia</em></a>, in which you played as a builder "tasked with completing essential jobs" to keep your town running,&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>will cast you as the town's governor.</p>
<p>The game will take place in a new settlement "on the fringes of the Free Cities", and you'll be facing down the Duvos Empire, recruiting settlers and creating a stronghold from which to resist a "more defined antagonist" than in previous series installments.</p>
<p><em>Evershine</em>'s campaign will fully support co-op for up to four players, although you can, of course, still enjoy it solo if you want to. It'll also feature "town management" gameplay for the first time in the series.</p>
<p>If you want to get a look at&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>in motion, you can check out the game's announcement trailer right here.</p>

<p>As well as all the above, Pathea says&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will also support modding for both single-player and multiplayer, so if you're the kind of person who likes to switch up their gameplay experience, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>is still "very early in development", according to Pathea, but the studio is launching a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign for the game</a> on September 24th, which is also when we'll get to learn more about it.</p>
<p>When it does eventually launch, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">future Nintendo platforms yet to be announced</a>", Pathea says. Stay tuned for more.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary director and animator whose entire filmography is exceptional, so ranking his films is no easy feat. You’d be hard-pressed to find a “bad” film from the Studio Ghibli co-founder, so this piece is more about ranking from great to masterpiece rather than from good to bad. Miyazaki’s meticulously crafted, hand-drawn animations are colorful and imaginative spectacles with strong female characters, fascinating fantasy creatures, and strong takes on environmental justice.<br></p><p>Hayao Miyazaki’s films may be animated, but they explore mature coming-of-age themes such as developing compassion, individuality, strength, and independence. There’s a deep and thought-provoking wisdom beneath his exciting adventures and magical worlds, which makes his films resonate with audiences of all ages. Read on to see how I ranked each of Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpieces, and see if you agree. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd / Columbia Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-recommend-id="image://3e9971ce76b6b4725b8d1b47c3115a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man sits on top of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s unfair to compare <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> to Hayao Miyazaki’s other films because it was not only his feature film debut but also part of the <em>Lupin III </em>franchise, a popular manga and anime series about legendary thief Arsène Lupin going on daring heists around the world. This time, he wants to rescue Princess Clarisse from being forced to marry a count. This is not one of Miyazaki’s more personal and imaginative stories about environmental justice, coming of age, or resilient female leads, but it does have some enjoyable broad comedy.<br></p><p>The animation is not as intricate as in his later films, but you can certainly see Miyazaki’s flair for whimsy in the thrilling set pieces such as car chases, clock-tower fights, and villains getting trapped in a castle’s catacombs. <em>Castle of Cagliostro</em> is a romp, and though it doesn’t reach the heights of the rest of Miyazaki’s filmography, it’s exciting to see the kernels of what the legendary director would become known for. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-recommend-id="image://cbb6bf774b8dc75785f364f5a25556e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A pig pilot gives a thumbs up.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Porco Rosso</em> is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s silliest films, telling a tale about a World War I fighter pilot who is turned into a pig. With his devil-may-care attitude and salty humor, the various hijinks he gets into are a delight to watch. As with most of Miyazaki’s films, the highlights are invigorating action scenes (in this case, aerial ones) that show off fast-paced, slick animation.<br></p><p>The surly Porco humorously contrasts with the strong-minded female characters like Fio, the plane repairwoman, and Gina, who is in love with him and unfazed by his pig-like appearance, and since Porco exudes so much confidence, her love seems perfectly believable. <em>Porco Rosso</em> is a playful adventure that lightly touches on much deeper themes of wartime trauma and fascism, in ways that only Miyazaki can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Walt Disney Pictures / Toho Co., Ltd.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-recommend-id="image://0198b2f498f39f6bea100b28ab789b3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ponyo floats in front of a boy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Ponyo </em>is one of Hayao Miyazaki’s most light-hearted films and an adaptation of Hans Christen Andersen’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. A five-year-old boy named Sosuke discovers a goldfish that wants to be a human little girl—even though this upsets the balance of nature and is against the wishes of her father, a sorcerer who lives in the depths of the ocean. After she gains the ability to become human and chooses to stay on land, a giant tsunami wreaks havoc on Sosuke’s coastal town, satellites fall from the sky, and the moon spins out of orbit.<br></p><p>Despite this, there’s lots of adorable, family-friendly humor to be found in Ponyo’s misunderstanding of life on land, along with quirks like her obsession with ham and the gleeful wiggling of her new toes. The story is thin and predictable, not quite as profound as Hayao Miyazaki’s more original fantasies, but the visuals of Ponyo’s underwater world are truly stunning—the vibrant schools of sea creatures, the amoebas, and the fish-shaped waves that Ponyo skims across are all eye-popping.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toei Company / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-recommend-id="image://11f95994500397b0255b5e127d0df6cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A girl looks up with an adorable fox-like creature perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em> is grand in scale and has powerful ecological messages, with a story of two nearby nations at war amidst an environmental wasteland. Nausicaä is the first of many of Miyazaki’s intelligent and brave heroines who must navigate a post-apocalyptic world. Her adventure takes her the Toxic Jungle, a thicket of giant plants, fungi, and huge, creepy-crawly insects, in search of hope and healing. </p><p>There’s a lot of visual variety in this film’s landscapes, from the rolling green hills and peaceful windmills of Nausicaä’s country home to ancient, magical ruins and dense, mysterious forests. But the highlights of <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind </em>are its action-packed flying scenes in which Nausicaä soars swiftly on her glider while warriors maneuver their giant bomber-like planes around her. It’s a rousing journey that is clearly in awe of both the beauty and mystery of nature, reminding us of our duty to protect our planet.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-recommend-id="image://e7d4a181bba1cb4ed348435a3c516e26" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sheeta and Pazu stand with arms around each other.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The title itself, <em>Castle in the Sky</em>, brings to mind an otherworldly spectacle, and the film gives us one: Laputa is a magical kingdom hidden amongst puffy clouds and shadows and one of Miyazaki’s most visually stunning settings. The quest young Pazu and Sheeta embark on to reach the titular castle is filled with action, high stakes, and drama. Sheeta and Pazu share a heartwarming friendship that’s tinged with romance—Sheeta is bashful and withdrawn, while Pazu is more lively and exuberant.<br></p><p>Their contrasting personalities make them compelling characters. They are both equally protective of one another; Sheeta bravely wants to finish the mission on her own so that Pazu is not hurt, but he refuses to leave her side. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>also features some of Miyazaki’s most vibrant villains, including an old crone and her quirky group of sky pirate sons and the stoic, deceitful Colonel Muska, who relentlessly pursue Sheeta’s crystal amulet. <em>Castle in the Sky </em>is a soaring fairy tale with a classic good-versus-evil story. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-recommend-id="image://e49ae4cdbf5444cbdca4306890ec48ea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A boy with a bandage on his head stands in front of a house.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Released a decade after his intended retirement, Hayao Miyazaki made <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> at 82 years old. The ambitious film treads familiar territory as a young boy goes on a journey to a brightly colored fantasy world where the living and the dead live in harmony (and there’s also an army of human-like parakeets). Set in 1940s Japan, the film centers 12-year-old Mahito, who has been mourning the death of his mother in a hospital fire after a Tokyo bombing raid by the Allies.<br></p><p>Miyazaki confronts this devastating event in a harrowing flashback sequence, set against a nearly black background, with huge balls of fire raining down on the city—it looks like hell on Earth. Miyazaki uses a hazy, sketch-like animation style to evoke the pain of Mahito’s memory. It’s a very visceral way to confront the audience with the pain and devastation of war, showing how trauma lives inside victims, especially the young ones, forever.<br></p><p>Mahito’s grief allows him to become easily swindled by a mysterious bird, voiced by a gravelly Robert Pattinson, who promises to reunite him with his mother. While <em>The Boy and the Heron</em> explores the ideas of grief, legacy, and family—which feel especially poignant coming from an older filmmaker—the story doesn’t quite come together as much as in Miyazaki’s other films, and the fantasy world is not as striking.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-recommend-id="image://a6a975579366955120ceb8a248fa14f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Howl embraces Sophie.

Transformed into a short crone, Sophie volunteers to work as a cleaning lady in Howl’s castle, a steampunk patchwork of wood and metal that loudly lumbers through the countryside. Sophie is kind and hardworking, while Howl is vain and self-absorbed, often throwing tantrums if his hair dye doesn’t turn out right. Despite his flaws, though, he has a good heart. Their differences make the romance that develops between them an enchanting watch.<br></p><p>The castle is also home to other eccentric characters that add a lot of humor, like Calcifer, a fire demon voiced by Billy Crystal, and a cute scarecrow named Turnip Head. Miyazaki ties all of these whimsical elements together with a poignant anti-war message, as you’d expect. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Toho Co., Ltd. / Miramax</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-recommend-id="image://a8f24032a416eb7248cf3217054b5a46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Princess Mononoke stands next to a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Princess Mononoke</em> takes a more biting, intense approach to environmentalism than some of Miyazaki’s other films. It’s a lengthy, sprawling epic about a young man involved in a war between the forest gods and a mining colony. He comes across the iron-willed Mononoke Hime, a young woman raised by the wolf god Moro. A nimble warrior and princess who wields a bone knife and spear, she’s not afraid do whatever it takes to protect the forest gods against the humans who have been systematically destroying their home. Princess Mononoke loves and fights fiercely, making her a bewitching heroine.<br></p><p>Unlike the fanciful creatures of Miyazaki’s other works, the animals in <em>Princess Mononoke</em> are more life-like, majestic, and hauntingly beautiful, and their detailed animation is breathtaking. There’s a towering elk with impressive antlers, a massive wolf, and the Forest Spirit—an awe-inspiring figure resembling both a stag and a mythical Kirin from Japanese folklore. <em>Princess Mononoke</em> does not hold back on the violence and suffering that comes standard with environmental destruction, making this high fantasy epic one of Miyazaki’s darkest and most powerful films.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-recommend-id="image://4292f58267a27e02ab5d8eaa8cefa230" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jiro Horikoshi looks up at a plane.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from a continued fascination with flight, <em>The Wind Rises</em> stands apart from Hayao Miyazaki’s other films. There are no mythical realms with fantastical creatures; instead, it’s a sophisticated World War II biopic of Jiro Horikoshi, the Japanese engineer who designed the fighter jets used at Pearl Harbor. Taking some creative liberties with Horikoshi’s life, <em>The Wind Rises</em> explores complex ideas about the price of artistic creation.<br></p><p>Miyazaki contrasts the lovingly crafted details of Horikoshi’s sleek machines and the serene countryside where they were created with the destruction and havoc these machines cause in the world, an internal struggle Horikoshi grapples with throughout the film. These contemplative themes are complemented by Jiro Horikoshi’s touching romance with a woman named Nahako. They meet unexpectedly during an earthquake and never forget one another until they reunite years later. After quickly falling in love, they marry when Nahako is diagnosed with tuberculosis.<br></p><p>The final words on the screen, “The wind rises...We must try to live” are a poetic reminder that although we are constantly swept away by the difficult changes of life, we must adapt to them. The sensitive, humanistic approach to adapting the life of a real person whose passion had severe global repercussions makes <em>The Wind Rises</em> one of Miyazaki’s greatest works.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-recommend-id="image://c54a119fcaf18cac5945096406d021a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiki and her cat fly on a broomstick over the ocean.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Kiki is one of Miyazaki’s most endearing heroines: resourceful and kind, curious and outspoken, gregarious and hardworking. At 13, all witches must live independently and discover their “special skill” and Kiki decides to explore flying, which she uses to start a delivery service for a bakery in a quaint coastal town. The gentle charm of <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>lies in the various townsfolk she encounters—like a rambunctious little boy with a huge, sleepy dog, an artist who wants to paint her, and kindly elderly ladies Kiki helps with household chores.<br></p><p>We follow the small, everyday challenges she faces, from hauling packages up tall stairs to dealing with a mischievous gust of wind that makes her lose her first delivery. <em>Kiki’s Delivery Service </em>builds to a thrilling climax in which Kiki must rescue her friend from a burning blimp. It’s a sweet, cozy coming-of-age journey that beautifully captures the uncertainties and heightened emotions of growing up and going out on your own.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-recommend-id="image://b02d88732f949c78ffef57a6ab16bbe1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totoro and kids sit on a tree branch over a river.

Not much happens in this simple tale about sisters adjusting to their new rural home while their mother recovers in the hospital, but it has so much imagination and heart. The lovely and uncomplicated narrative lets you focus on the magical forest spirit Totoro, a gentle giant with a fluffy, gray body and tall ears.<br></p><p><em>My Neighbor Totoro</em> is mostly composed of cute, breezy vignettes of Totoro and the sisters engaging in various activities: learning how to use an umbrella, making trees grow out of the ground with a dance, and flying through the air while hanging onto Totoro’s belly, overlooking the entire countryside. There are other enchanting creatures, too: dust bunnies, a giant cat bus with glowing eyes and mice for headlights, and tiny little Totoros that scurry through the forest. There’s a very emotional climax in which the 4-year-old Mei argues with her older sister Satsuki and gets lost, but for the most part <em>My Neighbor Totoro </em>is just a simple story about the magic of being a child. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-recommend-id="image://c58d58ede18a18df6253ee7279799dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chihiro looks shocked.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Spirited Away</em> has all the elements that make Hayao Miyazaki’s films so unique, but with a darker, Grimms’-fairy-tale-esque edge. 10-year-old Chihiro gets  swept away to a dreamlike fantasy world, but not one of excitement and adventure—one of uncertainty and danger. She must face numerous trials to rescue her parents who have been transformed into pigs.<br></p><p>While working at a spirit bathhouse, Chihiro meets surreal creatures that really show off the power of Miyazaki’s designs: evil twin witches, a giant baby, and No-Face, a masked spirit who grows larger with everything and anything he consumes. There’s also the repulsive Stink Spirit, a huge puddle of sludge, and the Susuwatari, small fuzzballs whose entire existence revolves around endlessly putting coal in the bathhouse boiler. </p><p><em>Spirited Away </em>is Hayao Miyazaki’s most mesmerizing film, thanks to its inventive design, sensitive portrayal of childhood fears, and suspenseful story. It’s an absolute classic that transcends the genre. <br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

RPG fans will find themselves right at home.</p><p>In <em>My Time at Portia</em> and <em>My Time at Sandrock</em>, players embraced the role of the builder, tasked with completing essential jobs to keep the town running—often taking on work others avoided. <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, however, introduces a fresh dynamic, transforming the player’s role and elevating you from builder to Governor. As the city’s key figure, you’ll start with nothing more than a modest campfire, but your vision and leadership will drive the development of the entire city and its citizens. With other characters handling the smaller, routine tasks, your role as Governor feels more relaxed, giving you the freedom to focus on shaping the city’s future and dive into the dangers that await.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_914876"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>All New Story-Driven Campaign</strong> – Be the Governor of a brand-new settlement on the fringes of the Free Cities, facing the almighty Duvos Empire.

But so far the game has not invited Maleficent to join the competition, and we all know how she feels about being snubbed. Gameloft has announced Maleficent will join with a Limited-Time Event during Season 9, Part 2, and we have a first look at the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Maleficent is a Trickster racer, meaning her class specializes in disrupting other racers and has an enhanced speed boost ability. Her unique ability, Mistress of Evil, has two applications. The standard attack has her raise her staff to call down lightning on the track in front of her, and successful hits will gain her a flame. Under the charged version, collecting six flames will activate her Dragon form, transforming Maleficent and her kart into a dragon that flies (in autopilot) at increased speed, and takes out any racers in her way.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Though Gameloft has not announced the details of her LTE, these events generally run for about a week and let you unlock new racers through completing a series of objectives with your other, already-unlocked racers. Maleficent joins as the special unlockable character in this part of the season, joining Cruella who was added during the last part.</p><p dir="ltr">Disney Speedstorm is currently in Season 9, Part 2. Speedstorm's Golden Pass track was split into two parts per season recently, and all of Season 9 is themed after Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. The Pirates franchise was already represented by Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann at launch, but the new season adds a new Pirates track along with four more Pirates characters: Davy Jones, Will Turner, Hector Barbossa, Tia Dalma.</p>

            <p>Sundance audience award-winning documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin - which tells the story of quadriplegic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player Mats Steen - is set to debut on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month.</p>
<p>Norwegian gamer Steen battled the degenerative disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and passed away in 2014 aged 25. However, during his 25 years, he touched many lives via his World of Warcraft avatar, Ibelin.</p>
<p>"Unbeknownst to his relatives, Steen was able to form deep friendships across vast distances, because of his passion and pastime," reads a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/ibelin-release-date-trailer-news">Netflix feature</a> on the documentary.</p>

<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin has been brought together by filmmaker Benjamin Ree, and features interviews with Steen's friends and family.</p>
<p>In addition to using archival footage, Ree also worked with animators on the documentary. These animators "used models lifted directly from the game to show viewers exactly what [Steen] would have seen as he played the game between 2004 and 2014".</p>
<p>When Ree finished creating The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, the filmmaker asked World of Warcraft developer Blizzard would consider waiving its intellectual property rights so the film could find a release. After watching the documentary themselves, and hearing Ree had "no plan B", the company's executives acquiesced.</p>
<p>The Remarkable Life of Ibelin will be available to stream via Netflix from 25th October. You can check out a trailer for the upcoming documentary above.</p>
<p>"It's a huge honour that Ibelin will now be on Netflix," Ree said. "Mats Steen's story will be available to so many millions of people across the world.</p>
<p>"I couldn't be more excited."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1835989031714169035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1835989031714169035%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Rockstar leaker Tez, the PC version of GTA V was updated earlier today to add the third-party anti-cheat system BattlEye, a popular software used in games like APB Reloaded, ARK, Arma, Battalion 1944, Conan Exiles, DayZ, Destiny 2, Escape from Tarkov, Fortnite, Insurgency, Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord, PlanetSide 2, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, PUBG: Battlegrounds, Skull and Bones, The Crew, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs: Legion, and XDefiant.</p>
<p>The lack of a proper anti-cheat system has long been the source of complaints among those who play GTA Online, the multiplayer mode of GTA V, on PC. BattlEye could certainly help improve the cheating situation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tez also looked into the new files released with the update and <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1836008467066147071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836008467066147071%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> a leftover metadata file that reportedly hints at Rockstar working on porting the next-generation update released on consoles to PC. GTA V on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X has included ray traced shadows and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-gets-ray-traced-reflections-on-ps5-and-xsx-still-no-word-for-pc-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ray traced reflections</a> for years now, so it might finally be time for PC players to get a visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Even with the bulk of Rockstar busy on GTA VI (currently slated to land in Fall 2025, barring any further delays), GTA Online is still being regularly updated with new content and events. The latest ongoing event is called 'Executive Bonuses':</p>
<p><em>Once you amass a stockpile of contraband inside your Warehouses, speak to Lupe and put your Staff to work sourcing Special Cargo at double the usual speed this week, and complete Special Cargo Sales to rake in 2X GTA$ and RP. Selling GTA$300,000 worth of Special Cargo throughout the week will complete the Weekly Challenge and land you GTA$100,000 as a reward. Pawning off extra crates in Export Mixed Goods will also dish out Double Rewards through September 18.</em></p>

Similar bugs are appearing in Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Hello Games' <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, and more according to users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1ficpjr/new_system_update_is_screwing_up_graphics_in_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>Sony appears aware of the issues, however, and is actively seeking a solution to at least those found in Final Fantasy 16. Square Enix confirmed it was working with the PlayStation maker to address the issues introduced through the firmware update in an <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter post</a>.</p><p>"Following the recent release of the PlayStation 5 system update, there have been reports of the game crashing and graphical issues," Square Enix said. "We are currently working with Sony Interactive Entertainment to investigate, and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please await our further updates."</p><p>Sony has yet to make a statement itself regarding the issues and just how widespread they are, but IGN has reached out for comment. The firmware did bring a handful of intended changes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-ps5-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-new-features">including a Welcome Hub, Party Share, and more</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
