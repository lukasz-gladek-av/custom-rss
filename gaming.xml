			<p>Balatro is an indie game that took the world by storm when it was first released in February 2024. It is regarded as one of the most unique games out there. It combines Poker with roguelike elements, making for a time-consuming experience. Today, it was announced during Nintendo's Indie Direct that Balatro will be receiving its first collaboration with four hit games. The update is completely free and will be released today across all platforms, named Balatro: Friends of Jimbo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Balatro: Friends of Jimbo – Reveal Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8188WZxHSkU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This update</a> is entirely cosmetic; players won't need to worry about purchasing anything. The update includes collaborations with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-reputation-system-mod/">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, Dave the Diver, Vampire Survivors and Among Us. This update allows players to use themed decks from each of the collaborators if they find that they are bored of using the normal cards that come with Balatro, or they just want a change in aesthetic.</p>
<p>While the trailer does give Balatro players a glimpse into the decks available, the trailer was quite short, with a duration just over one minute. However, the trailer did showcase the key aesthetics from each collaboration, with players able to use cards in-game that have Geralt of Rivia, Yennefer of Vengerberg and Jaskier the Bard on them, for example.</p>
<p>While it's said to be purely cosmetic, it's possible that these new decks could feature some cards that bring new twists to the game and add a new level of variety to Balatro for those who have sunk a considerable amount of time into it. Even if it doesn't, it adds a cool extra level of customization for those who want to be able to pick and choose a deck to play with rather than just the standard base game one.</p>
<p>While the Balatro: Friends of Jimbo update is a small cosmetic update that is available today to everyone across all platforms, it's said that there is a major update coming in 2025 to the game, which will "bring new ideas and strategies to the game." What that could entail remains to be seen, but what we do know is that the first major update for this time-sink game is that it will be completely free as a "token of huge appreciation to the game's brilliant and passionate community."</p>

It’s one of the best movies I’ve ever seen,” Tarantino told Maher. “And if you’ve seen the other two, then it’s devastating.”</p><p>“But the thing is, then three years later or something, they did a fourth [film].

PC, and Nintendo Switch. Horizon is a PlayStation brand, and Sony's own Guerrilla Games is developing Lego Horizon Adventures alongside Studio Gobo, but Sony is increasingly bringing more of its games to PC. Lego Horizon Adventures is not Sony's first game on a rival platform, though, as the MLB The Show franchise has appeared on rival systems for years. As of yet, however, there is no word on an Xbox release for Lego Horizon Adventures.</p><h2 id="Lego_Horizon_Adventures_story__setting__and_characters">Lego Horizon Adventures story, setting, and characters</h2><p>Lego Horizon Adventures re-tells some of the story beats from the main Horizon series, so that means you'll play as Aloy. She's found in a cave as a baby, before being raised by a huntsman named Rost--he guides her on her journey. Aloy goes up against Helis, the leader of a group of sunworshippers. </p><p>"There's much more in store for Aloy and her friends, as their adventure sends them across the tallest mountains and deepest cauldrons--all beautifully recreated in LEGO elements," reads a line from the game's description.</p><h2 id="Lego_Horizon_Adventures_co_op">Lego Horizon Adventures co-op</h2><p>The Lego series of games is known for supporting co-op, and that continues with Lego Horizon Adventures. The game can be played solo or with friends through both local couch co-op or online.</p><p dir="ltr">"We were determined to make a Lego game unlike any other Lego game," James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-your-typical-lego-game/1100-6524180/" data-ref-id="1100-6524180">told GameSpot</a>. "From a visual perspective, we wanted to make a statement in the sense that we wanted to create a playable Lego movie in terms of the visual quality. But one of the things that's really unique about it and very different from other games is that everything you see is made from individual bricks. Every asset could, in theory, be made from physical material, Lego pieces."</p><h2 id="Lego_Horizon_Adventures_price">Lego Horizon Adventures price</h2><p>Lego Horizon Adventures is not yet available to preorder, so there is no word on the price.</p>

During that brief interim, he and Nogami were assigned to work as advisors on an odd new concept called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist: Talent Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text">—part of a series of 64DD software all named under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> umbrella.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> built on the foundation that its 1992 predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Paint</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> built—not a traditional game, but creativity software for drawing, painting, animating, and composing. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Paint</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cast a wide net for all kinds of artistic exploration, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series software was more specialized and robust. After being briefly touted as a singular monolithic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Paint 64</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the first three split titles—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paint Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Polygon Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Talent Studio—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">were announced during Nintendo's 1997 Space World</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> event as complementary programs that could work together to bring creations to life. 2D images drawn in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paint Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could be applied as textures to the 3D models in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Polygon Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which could then be imported into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Talent Studio,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the title that Eguchi and Nogami were working on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Talent Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a "virtual production studio" where players could customize avatars, give them props, and place them in dozens of wacky animated scenarios reminiscent of the kind seen in popular Japanese variety shows. Its "movie-making" mode was especially strange and playful. In one sample movie, a steamy-faced man nearly runs over an old lady in his car, but with a crack of lightning, she hurls a burst of blue energy </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-style at his car, sending it flying through the air. With no real "gameplay" to speak of, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Talent Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an application focused on the joy of personal expression and goofiness rather than having any sort of concrete goal. And, like people would later say about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it "sounded pretty dumb"—at least according to IGN's Peer Schneider.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aside from having more powerful hardware and large storage capacity, a big part of the 64DD's marketed appeal was its internet communication features. Primitive by today's standards (and ultimately under-delivering on promised features), the 64DD's Randnet was a paid, members-only online service that allowed users to surf the web, communicate, and share content from their system. So while making art, videos, and other content was the base idea of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, sharing and talking about those creations with others was an integral part of the intended experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "Talent" in this context was used to describe the stars and hosts of Japanese TV programs, often doing silly and over-the-top stunts that they were not necessarily talented at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Nintendo's video game exhibition and press event that ran from 1989 to 2001. From 1989-1996 it was called "Shoshinkai."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[3]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Schneider went on to give </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario Artist Talent Studio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a review of 8.2/10—he actually loved it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was fresh from working on this odd, creatively engaging non-game concept that Eguchi returned to games. In 1999, Eguchi submitted a simple, two-page pitch titled "Proposing a Communication Field." It was not exactly a game pitch, but a game</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>play</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pitch—the earliest foundation of what would eventually become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"At the time I was very busy with work, and there was no way for me to play games together with my family," recalled Eguchi in a 2008 Nintendo Game Seminar</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[4]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Maybe there's something we could do where someone in a similar environment to me could come home late and play, which would somehow overlap with what the kids had done." This was the basis of his pitch: an environment where many people could occupy and permanently affect the same gameplay area. People could play "together" even if their schedules didn't match up. The 64DD would be the perfect system for it—its internal "real-time clock" meant that they could have a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>persistent world</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[5]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that followed in-step with the time and date of the real world. Its comparatively high memory capacity meant that changes to that world could easily and permanently be stored and retained. It also meant they might be able to utilize the online capabilities of Randnet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a nod of approval to develop the project for the Nintendo 64DD, he and Nogami began to imagine what such a game could be like, and how it could use the advanced technology of the 64DD.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were consciously trying to create something in a new game that you couldn't easily reduce to a single label," said Eguchi. There was no "genre" at first. As he so eloquently put it, the youngest stage of the game was a place where multiple people could simply "do stuff and hang out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of communication between people was the game's biggest theme from the start, drawing on both Eguchi's nostalgia for the community he left behind in Chiba, as well as a desire to connect more closely with people he wasn't typically able to play with—like his wife and kids. However, "community" and "communication" are broad terms that don't really sound much like they describe a video game, and might not be easily understood. He and Nogami felt they probably needed some "normal," familiar gameplay elements to sell the market on a brand new idea—and those elements came from an unlikely source.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a 2006 GDC</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[6]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> talk, Eguchi showed off some of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s earliest planning documents, the first of which described the game's concept as "a multiplayer game that provides a place where players can communicate with each other and cooperate to reach common goals." Essentially, players would need to use teamwork to accomplish their objectives. Eguchi and Nogami admitted that they didn't necessarily </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>want</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a goal-based game, but were operating on the assumption that it was a necessary draw for gamers—"communication" alone wouldn't drive people to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eguchi envisioned a powerless player, the antithesis of Nintendo's capable heroes like Mario and Link, who would need to rely on the help of animals to accomplish tasks. For example, to retrieve something beyond a tall obstacle, he might have to play in the morning in order to find a bird who could fly over it for him. This was the first time animals had come up at all in development. Multiple players would be able to team up using their arsenal of animal friends to fight some great evil in a dungeon-crawling, RPG-like environment. "But what we really wanted," Eguchi stressed, "was for players to be communicating, and have this communication be so enjoyable in and of itself, that they forgot about any evil bosses."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the time, Eguchi was playing a lot of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[7]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with his co-workers at Nintendo. He loved the way that the game facilitated cooperation and communication: working together to fight through the dungeons, showing off cool new equipment he'd collected, and even begging his friends to return to the dungeons with him where he'd died and dropped said cool equipment. He was, in fact, "a little obsessed," a colleague of his once told me with a smile.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s social gameplay loop—the idea of experiencing something in the game, telling your friends about it in real life, and then experiencing something together in the game—mirrors the concept of communication that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> meant to convey, according to Eguchi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's right. Adorable, peaceful</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was inspired by the hellish, demon-packed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and began life as a multiplayer dungeon-crawler that would use the abilities of animals to help you fight evil.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> What?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was not some jotted-down-on-a-table-napkin idea, either. Animal-Assisted-</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the game Eguchi and Nogami gained approval for and set to work on, setting up dungeons, designing item types, and even approaching artists and designers to begin the project. It was to use the 64DD's internal clock for a real-time day and night cycle. It even had a world layout—four islands based on the four seasons, each filled with dungeons. The pair had even nailed down which animals would be used in the game and what skill each would have. The animals weren't friendly neighbors to hang out with—they were simply tools to be wielded. This was, quite seriously, what we might have got instead of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[4]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Nintendo Game Seminars were the evolution of Nintendo Dentsu Game Seminars—yearly educational events to help game design students learn from Nintendo veterans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[5]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> A virtual world which continues to exist and develop even when no people are interacting with it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[6]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Game Developers Conference, a long-running industry conference marked by hundreds of panels, talks, and seminars from game industry professionals of all types.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[7]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text">Diablo is a multiplayer action role-playing game for the PC released in 1996 by Blizzard. It's set in a dark fantasy world with demonic themes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="But then something major happened">But then something major happened</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eguchi and Nogami were told they could no longer develop their game for the 64DD. A myriad of development delays and an embarrassing lack of software with enough polish to showcase caused Nintendo to, for the first time in its history, cancel its own 1998 Space World event. By the time they returned in the summer of 1999, it seemed like most of the games originally slated for the system were going to be redesigned to run on the significantly less powerful Nintendo 64—if not axed entirely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suddenly, Eguchi and Nogami found themselves working with much less storage and power than the Nintendo 64DD was capable of utilizing. Change would have to be drastic: they couldn't simply trim features or scale back a little, the hardware change demanded a complete and total overhaul. Eguchi and Nogami sat down and thought carefully about what they could do.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going back to the core concept, the most important part of this game was that it provided a space for communication. That part </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>had</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to be preserved. A standard Nintendo 64 cartridge could no longer fit four separate island areas, so perhaps it could be cut to just one. With only one island, the play area was probably too small for an adventure now, but maybe it didn't need to be an adventure. In fact, all they really wanted out of the dungeons, the great forces of evil, and the story was a familiar and easily-understood way to entice people to actually pick up the game. Now there was no adventure, so perhaps the game needed no story. No story meant no need for an ending. Traditional video game elements were quickly falling away, and instead they established the five things they knew the game</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> absolutely needed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to have to facilitate communication:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A playing field in which the results of player actions remain</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some sort of motivation for interacting with this playing field</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game elements that become conversation material or inspire conversation</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game elements that tie players together through shared experiences</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something that entices the player to play every day</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was here that development for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as we know it truly began.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scaling the game down this enormously forced Nogami and Eguchi to ask: What could a player even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>do</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in such a small environment? The first idea to stick was designing a room. If you could design your own room, wouldn't you want to show it off to your friends?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They were right. Any time I've started a new town in any Animal Crossing game, the first thing I create is a coffee shop in my house. When I was young, I loved coffee. I was very fixated on appearing mature, and somehow I got it in my head that the pinnacle of maturity was drinking black coffee and hanging out at coffee shops. Naturally, then, I had to create one. If you've played subsequent games in the Animal Crossing series, you're probably aware that there's usually already a coffee shop in town, run by a rather reserved pigeon named Brewster. In the first game though, the in-home coffee shop was my own idea, and I've carried it on as a personal tradition in every game in the series. It was a hard thing to create back then, too—there wasn't even a coffee cup item to use for decorating. My room had dark wood floors, a jukebox, some fancy tables, and tea sets. I was even able to hang a coffee cup pattern I designed myself on the door to my house. It took a little bit of imagination, but I was very proud of it. I took photos with my mom's digital camera so I could show it off on the forums of AnimalCrossingCommunity.com.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The idea of having your own room and decorating it is incredibly simple, but that's when [Eguchi and Nogami] hit on the framework that would allow players to play the game a long time," said Nintendo's Satoru Iwata, who acted as the game's Executive Producer. Decorating your home is a dynamic element that can be worked on or overhauled completely as people play through the game and discover new furniture they want to use, whether that's creating a cozy room of wooden "cabin" furniture, or an entire construction scene, complete with traffic cones and oil drums. This led to the next step, which was determining </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the rooms could be decorated and where the player might source furniture and other materials. The animals that were once mere tools in the original RPG concept were reimagined as shop owners that you could actually speak to and interact with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having a custom room to show off might encourage communication, but it's not necessarily engaging. The developers needed to craft ways for players to experience the game world uniquely at different times, just as their conceptual RPG had. Among the first things formed from this was the idea of a shop that only restocked once per day. Two players on the same cartridge could not each buy the same item, so if you played later in the day, you might miss something you really wanted. At first, the developers worried this would cause arguments, but decided that the communication opportunities it opened would be appealing. A parent playing the game in the evening might have to bargain with their child for items they purchased earlier, or siblings might have to negotiate who gets to play first after school. These were the sort of "real world" communication scenarios they were after. Down the line, when the development team added the ability to catch bugs and fish, they made sure to include several that could only be caught during certain times of the day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These ideas necessitated keeping the real-time, persistent world from the initial pitch, but without the 64DD, additional hardware—a real-time clock—would have to be built into the Nintendo 64 cartridge itself. The real-time clock is a chip, powered by an internal battery expending small amounts of energy in order to remain active for decades, even when it isn't plugged into the system and powered on. Including the chip was an expensive undertaking. "Adding [the real-time clock] really increased the cost of the cart, and as a result, we had to keep the cart memory size down as much as possible," explained producer Takashi Tezuka</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That smaller cartridge memory—about half of the size used by</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—forced them to get even more creative with where they could cut corners. For instance, while the Nintendo 64 is capable of displaying millions of colors, each single model in the game uses just sixteen. According to Tezuka, limiting the color palette was an intentional choice to help mitigate those memory restrictions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps one of the weirdest differences between </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games is that the two directors purposefully designed it so that you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>wouldn't get "too" into it</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Instead, they wanted people to play for just a little bit each day, so that they'd still be able to get the satisfaction of playing a game without throwing their home or work-life balance out of whack. "We made it so that you'd run out of things to do if you went on and on playing," Eguchi explained in a Nintendo Game Seminar, to which Satoru Iwata responded with a laugh: "Normally you make games that players don't want to quit!" But the strategy made sense. How often do you decide not to buy or begin a game because you know you won't have the time to finish it? For busy adults and kids, playing for a few minutes each day is often more realistic than spending several weeks binging. This is even reflected in the game's original working title: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sono Higurashi</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a phrase roughly meaning "living day to day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The changes in gameplay led them to revisit an old idea from their brainstorming sessions: targeting new demographics. Adventure games sold well among boys, but now that the adventure elements were gone, they considered how they might create a game that attracted the whole family, including "women and housewives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By the mid-90s, Nintendo was having a bit of a crisis. The near-monopolistic king of home video games in the 80s (in Japan and the US), Nintendo found itself getting squeezed by competitors—especially Sony, whose CD-ROM based PlayStation console was a welcome change for publishers sick of paying expensive cartridge costs and abiding by Nintendo's strict rules.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Some companies that had been on begrudgingly compliant terms with Nintendo jumped at the chance to develop for a platform that was not only free of Nintendo's costly and restrictive mandates, but also backed by an enormous and wealthy company like Sony. Strong third-party support for the PlayStation meant a strong base of customers, so rather than scrabbling with Sony over the (male-skewing) "core gamer" demographic of the time, some Nintendo developers wanted to focus on creating entirely new customers for video games instead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Targeting these "non-gamers" was easier said than done. They couldn't just thrust a controller into the hands of people indifferent to video games, so instead the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">decided it was important to make the game enjoyable for children, but engaging and mature enough that their mothers would want to play, too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo didn't have a lot of female development staff</span><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[3]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at the time, and those they did have were mainly artists and designers—some fresh out of college. Most of them ended up working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team's gender makeup was intentional. The game's producer, Takashi Tezuka, felt that a game targeting women certainly needed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>input</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of women, and so seven women were put on the project. Diversity of input, and diversity of ideas—that was the key to making this game resonate with a wider audience. That may seem obvious, but it's not usually the norm in Japanese workplace culture, which tends to be more hierarchical (and at least in Nintendo's case, male-centric).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were told from the very beginning that we should all be voicing our opinions as often as possible," said Toki Iida, a new hire who began her career working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s screen and menu design. The whole office was rearranged to encourage talking and sharing ideas. Partitions were lowered so they could see everyone from their desks, and a big round table in the center offered a communal place to get feedback. "That was also where we kept all of the sweets," she added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a way, the office culture surrounding the game's development was almost like living in the world of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> itself. Anyone could communicate with anyone, express their ideas, add their own personality, and make an impact on the finished product. "I really do feel sometimes like it was a personal project more than a business one," Katsuya Eguchi said in an interview with Japanese magazine </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Nintendo Dream</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I think that sentiment is widely shared by the entire staff."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Personal touches are everywhere throughout the game if you know where to look. Some are cut and dry, like Piroshi, the bespectacled chicken villager modeled after Nintendo's then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi.

Plenty of items of furniture even came from Nintendo staff outside the design team who simply had ideas for decorations they personally wanted in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We got to create most of what we wanted," said Eguchi in an interview with</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Nintendo Dream</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Each of the designers and programmers really got into it, and we let them go all out and get really detailed with what they wanted to do." Already-established worlds like Super Mario's Mushroom Kingdom and Zelda's Hyrule were creatively limiting compared to working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It was built from the ground-up, and Eguchi says it "feels like a strange parallel world of our own personal lives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can't help but think this is where some of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s strength comes from. The development process was, though certainly not free from the normal stresses of game development, an overall rewarding and even personal journey for those who worked on it. The collaborative nature of the project brought forth dozens of ideas that would have never been possible in a more typically Japanese structured and rigid work environment. Entire game concepts and major characters sprung from completely casual conversations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This development style has remained fairly intact through each addition to the series. "Every morning we'd have these project meetings, but sometimes they turned into barbecues or opportunities for people to bring in sweets," recalled series sound director Kazumi Totaka in an interview about the Nintendo 3DS game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing: New Leaf</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It felt like the whole game just naturally came about while we were all hanging out together." There's such a positive attitude towards the series' development and shared ideas, it's no wonder that the games reflect its designers' sense of community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Katsuya Eguchi is often credited as "the guy who made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">," but he doesn't see it that way. He feels that the enormous amount of collaboration and input from the team really makes the game an authorless piece of work…or perhaps one that has too many authors to count. "It feels like I don't even know who created the game," he remarked in an interview with Japanese magazine </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Famitsu</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Takashi Tezuka is among Nintendo's most veteran staff. Like Nogami, he graduated from Osaka University of the Arts. Sometimes called Nintendo's "secret weapon," Tezuka has made enormous contributions to some of Nintendo's most popular franchises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span data-testid="content-text"> To add insult to injury, the "Play Station" was originally designed as a CD-ROM add on for the Super Nintendo system.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/getting-under-the-hood-of-racing-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no feeling quite like getting behind the wheel of a really good racing game and hitting the track for the first time. Whether you’re a fan of realistic competitive racing, fast and furious chaos or breathtaking scenery and a good tune on the radio, racing games are one of the most flexible, adaptable and enduring genres of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s been over 50 years since players could first get into the virtual driver’s seat - with Atari’s Gran Trak 10 releasing in May of 1974 – the genre has only continued to rapidly accelerate, and never falls off the podium as one of the most popular genres on the market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Franchise Development Director at Sumo Sheffield, I know a thing or two about racing games. I've been working on racing games for over 27</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">years, with 21 of those spent at Sumo playing a key role on games including Outrun2, Outrun 2006: Coast2Coast, and Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing: Transformed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So let's buckle in and get under the hood of what makes racing games so popular, their history, some key checkpoints in racing game history and how developers can steer games to success.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The road and you: The popularity of racing games">The road and you: The popularity of racing games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you ever find yourself driving on a smooth, open-road with no traffic, blue skies blaring and your favourite music blasting? No? Me neither! Most of us never get the opportunity to experience true freedom when driving… that is until we pick up our favourite driving or racing game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Video games are the perfect medium when it comes to offering players a wide range of experience, to fulfil wishes and present them with a whole range of emotions in a safe environment. So while the real-world you might be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, in-game you can make true those open-road cruising dreams.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This, combined with the fact that racing games offer relatively straight-forward gameplay which players intrinsically understand, have literally hundreds of different styles to choose from, and can scale in experience from the casual ‘pick up and play’ audience, right through to the highly dedicated progression-seekers, make racing games one of the most popular and enduring genres of games.</span></p><p>Captured in August 2024. This volume chart features racing games that were released onto Steam between 2006 and 2024. While the numbers might not be as dramatic as some of the top genres – like Shooters or Action and Adventure – they’re a good indicator that the genre continues to grow in popularity and scale.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And the games industry – which is usually ready to meet the demands of players head on – knows it. According to SteamDB, the rate at which racing and driving games are being released onto the platform has been slowly but surely increasing over the last decade: with just 68 being released in 2014, and 538 releasing in 2023. Whilst racing may not be overtaking the most popular genres, shooters and action-adventure, in releases, it still holds its own as a genre that entertains, thrills and even educates its players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our love of racing dates back to the very inception of the games industry, and I would argue has been one of the genres that is able to best showcase the power and capabilities of new hardware. Since Enduro launched for the Atari 2600 in 1983, we’ve seen a trend of games consoles having a racing game in their catalogue of launch titles, including the original PlayStation launching with Ridge Racer, the SEGA Saturn launching with Daytona USA, both the Xbox and Xbox 360 came with Project Gotham Racing incarnations – and of course the Wii U launch with Sonic &amp; All-Star Racing Transformed! Each title is able to showcase increased speed, most responsive controls and stunning visuals better than any other genre, and can really push the envelope of the technical capabilities of a console.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, style and flexibility is one of the major reasons video games continue to grow in popularity. Whether you’re wanting a hyper-realistic simulation experience that can see you climb the ranks and drive realistic cars around real-world tracks, if you want multiplayer chaos where you can betray your family and friends to win the trophy, or if you just want to cruise around and explore scenery and environments, there’s a racing game to suit you.</span></p><p>There’s something about the sunshine – a still from the world of Outrun 2006: Coast2Coast. From the hyper-realistic, to cartoon kart-racers… and everything in between, racing games as a genre offers a wide variety of styles, gameplay mechanics and features so there’s something for everyone to enjoy.]</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="HIGHLIGHT REEL | Iconic Moments in Racing Game History">HIGHLIGHT REEL | Iconic Moments in Racing Game History</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve worked in the games industry for a long time, and have borne witness to lots of major releases that shaped and evolved the way audiences engage with games, the way they’re made and the way they’re received by the world. Unsurprising, then, that many of these titles sit within or adjacent to the racing genre – with classics that were immediate hits, ones that have gone on to spur long-standing franchises or ones that have been lost to time but remain hugely popular.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Here are some of the biggest moments in racing game history that, in my opinion, changed the game for developers:</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pole Position (1982) – Defining the Template:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Whilst Pole Position was by no means the first arcade racing game, it defined the template for many that followed. First the low down, but wide field of view camera to give that sense of speed, the lo/hi shifter, plenty of rivals to race and the worse enemy of all, time! Add bright colourful graphics, high quality sound (and speech!) and it was an instant arcade hit. Quite the achievement given the technology available at the time – and the great grandparent of many racing games that we know today.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>OutRun (1986) – Digital Wish Fulfilment:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Well, you know we must mention this one! Instead of racing circuits, now we’re on a journey driving into the sunset in a Ferrari Testarossa with our best girl at our side. OutRun was an amazing road trip, the Cannonball Run powered by SEGA’s Super Scaler technology. Pick your favourite tune (Splash Wave, of course!) and take to the road, which - for the first time - allows you to pick which way to head at the end of each stage. Visually, aurally and physically, OutRun was an instant classic and changed driving games forever.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Kart (1992) – Family Fun with Comfortable Characters:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Our moustachioed hero and his colourful cast of characters were going to end up on this list somewhere, so we might as well go back to where it all began. From its 16-bit beginnings for the SNES, to the ultra-polished, IP-incorporating behemoth franchise it’s become over time. Mario Kart has always been popular and has had a history of becoming a key title for each new generation of Nintendo console. What Mario Kart provides is fast family fun which brings people together, with interesting gameplay mechanics, fun power-ups and a comforting, familiar set of characters to play with, all whilst offering multiplayer or single-player campaign where dedicated players can grow their skills. Each new game that releases improves and builds upon its speed, handling, adds new tracks and characters, and brings back retro ones to play on our sense of nostalgia.</span></p><p>Virtua Racing completely refreshed the way racing games were made – bringing a cartoon art style into 3D worlds which players could experience from four different angles… and let’s not forget that all-important blue sky!</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Virtua Racing (1992) – The Dawn of the Polygon Age:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Launching in the very same month, Virtua Racing appears in arcades and racing games will never be the same again. We move from 2D into full 3D, and you can now choose to race from one of four camera positions, all designed to show off the fast, high-resolution graphics and one of the first arcade games to run on 16:9 screens too! Add incredible engine sounds and SEGA’s classic musical jingles – plus some of the best blue skies in the business – and suddenly all other racing games looked old fashioned. Visually it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">have inspired Sumo’s own Hotshot Racing…</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ridge Racer (1993) – Pioneering Drifting as a Core Mechanic</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">A year later and we see a technological arms race between Namco and SEGA to produce the most realistic 3D graphics. Ridge Racer adds textures and Gouraud shading to the mix, but it’s the gameplay that’s the star. Tap the brake as you enter the turn and you can trigger one of the most satisfying drifts around corners and used well, slice seconds off your lap times. Musically we’re bang up to date with some rather techno inspired tunes to race too. Of course, just two years later Ridge Racer is a PlayStation launch title and consoles begin to overtake the arcade in terms of innovation…!</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gran Turismo (1997) - Bringing Real-World Cars to the Gaming World:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Taking everything people loved about arcade-style racers, combining it with simulation experience and bringing it into people’s homes, Gran Turismo was truly unique upon its release. The game offers a high level of realism when it comes to car physics and appearance, graphics and track detail – with Silverstone, Nürburgring and Le Mans all appearing with delightful accuracy – and lets players collect credits, progress their skills and win trophies and prizes. Although it wasn’t the first to introduce licensed cars to the video game world, Gran Turismo built upon and expanded the concept, and featured the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, the 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and the Dodge Viper… now who wouldn’t want to take those for a spin?</span></p></div><p>A screenshot from the 2018 remaster of Burnout Paradise. Instead of getting players to focus on great driving skills, Burnout brought a new dynamic to the racing genre in encouraging players to cause as much damage and chaos as possible.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Burnout (2001) – It’s Good to Be Bad:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">When players loaded into Burnout back in the early 00s they were surprised to find that its focus was not about smooth driving techniques and skills on the track, but were instead challenged to tackle traffic, junctions and obstacles in their races. Seemingly, these are all things we’re actively looking to escape in our real-world driving experiences… but what separated Burnout from the rest was its over-the-top action and dramatic crashes! Its successor, Burnout 2: Point of Impact introduced a separate ‘Crash’ mode where players had to cause as much damage as possible in the time limit. This was revolutionary for the genre and has become the defining feature of the series through the years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project Gotham Racing 2 (2005) - More players = More fun!</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Technically the third game in the series (as it started life as Metropolis Street Racer on the Dreamcast), PGR 2 took the already great ingredients of real-world cities, an amazing stable of cars and the sublime Kudos system (drive with style!) and added online play throughout. Using Xbox Live meant players could race against anyone in the world (and trade trash talk, of course) or battle asynchronously for leaderboard positions… and it even added DLC in later years which featured new cars and cities for players to challenge upon. Later incarnations polished this formula further, but PGR2 set a definite new bar for all games that followed.</span></p><p>Outrun 2006: Coast2Coast is one of the most fun games I’ve worked on during my careers. We had the opportunity to faithfully adapt the original, arcade machine version and bring new features to it… including my personal favourite: “Don’t Lose Your Girlfriend”, which introduced a risk-reward dynamic not seen before in the game.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outrun 2006: Coast2Coast (2006) – Introducing the Slipstream System</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, I was always going to include one of my all-time favourite games not only to work on, but to play. When we spoke to SEGA about bringing Outrun 2006: Coast2Coast from arcade machines to the living rooms of players, we were tasked with maintaining the ‘arcade feel’, high-speed driving, stunning visuals and all the fun of the original, while adding our own missions, level design and flair. Whilst we built upon the work we’d done on Outrun2 just two years earlier, Coast 2 Coast saw us really get comfortable with the IP and introduce things we felt fit the franchise, including a structured gameplay experience and a progression system, more cars, new modes, online play and the introduction of the slipstream system which can be found in modern-day racing games. It challenges and rewards players in equal measures, and I still think it’s as bright, colourful and genuinely fun to play as it was all those years ago. Oh and we squeezed it into a PSP so you could play it on the go too!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Forza Horizon (2012) – Hitting the Open World:</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">The Forza Horizon series offers players everything we long for in driving: big, beautiful and explorable environments, a wide range of licensed cars and an all-round great atmosphere and vibe. I truly believe that this open-world game took all of the lessons of the titles that came before it and built upon them to create a truly unique and engaging game which has gone on to span sequels and spin-offs, all of which keep evolving and enhancing. Players can take part in a myriad of race-types, including circuit, off-road and traditional, but also have the opportunity to buckle up and head into the vast landscape created for them. You can see how Forza Horizon built further on Microsoft’s experience from the PGR and Forza Racing series with successful content updates, strong engaging with its community and raised the bar even higher for the genres’ future in live service.</span></p><p>Is it a plane? Is it a boat? Is it a car? YES! Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed made popular the transforming tracks concept, and ensured players had more to look at than just the main race whenever they played. Look out for flying dragons, jumping whales and battling ships adding to the chaos of this colourful kart-racer.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed (2012) – Transforming Tracks</span></span><br><span data-testid="content-text">OK, sorry, self-indulgence for one last time, but this is still my favourite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>released </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game and one where we took all our previous racing game experience to push the genre forward in ways players wouldn’t expect! What if your car could transform into a boat or a plane? What if we mixed our favourite SEGA characters and worlds? What if you could ride a mechanical turtle on a race set on lava? Well, Transformed answered all those questions! We crammed in as much SEGA as was legally allowed into one massive love letter to racing game fans and even managed to sneak in a bonus OutRun2-themed track! Plus what other game lets you race as a Dreamcast controller? Let’s not forget it was also Wii U launch title with five-player split screen play!</span></p><p>Audio plays a huge role in creating a great racing game with a combination of authentic car audio, ambient road noise and, of course, some really great music. Encapsulating all of these is driving-adjacent game, Grant Theft Auto - the radio stations of which have become something of legend. In 2023, Spotify launched ‘Grand Theft Auto Radio’ which pulls hidden gems and classics from your favourite artists across all genres, as if they were tracks on the GTA Radio Stations.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="DEVELOPING SPEED | Tips for How to Gear Up Your Racing Game">DEVELOPING SPEED | Tips for How to Gear Up Your Racing Game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the best thing about working on racing games is that they are genuinely fun to make – the unpredictability of the races, the visuals and the joy of getting to speed around means playtesting is always fun, and we’re always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what can be done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In my experience, there are a few core elements that can supercharge a racing game and take it from third place to champion. Here are some of my top tip to any developers planning to write their own racing game…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Get the Sense of Speed Right:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> In any racing game, you need give players a breadth of speeds and they all have to feel authentic and accurate. No one wants to be going full-throttle on the controller, only to find that their car is idling along at 30. To do this, make sure the camera is low and wide so you can get a sense of speed and movement, and create audio that sounds like the engine is always accelerating – even if you’re already going at top speed. If it looks fast and sounds fast, then you’re most of the way there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t Underestimate Audio: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">You might think that the primary focus of racing games is all about the visuals, but a lot of audio work needs to happen to immerse players into the action. Not only does the SFX for vehicles have to feel authentic and empowering, but the environmental sound needs to reflect actions of the player, and – of course – the music has to add to the pacing of the game… Listening to piano sonatas in the final round of a cup series is not conducive to a winning environment!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Implement a Learning Curve</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Most racing games have a purity to them that makes them accessible for anyone at any skill level to pick up and play, and the ones that have continued to endure are those that give players the option to go on a learning curve and grow their skills. This grants players the opportunity to play their way – some want to race around in a social setting and just have fun, others want to learn the tracks and mechanics, and perfect their techniques... and be rewarded for doing so.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Physics and Handling</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Regardless of the type of racing game you’re making – whether it be sim, arcade sim or realistic experience – players have to feel like they are in control. Having solid, predictable responses to the impact of a player, depth in how a vehicle behaves in a variety of situation, or how upgrades/customisation change the behaviour of a vehicle will encourage players to keep playing, building and growing. And, regardless of style, if you can capture the handling feel of different models and types of cars, you’re giving the player the opportunity to get behind the wheel of some of their favourites – a key draw of why people love to play them!</span></p><p>Games like Forza Horizon 5 take environments to a new level and give players an open-world experience, where they can encounter breathtaking scenery and stunning visuals. Another world from the congestion of our every day commutes. As technology continues to evolve, developers are able to create even more spectacular graphics which elevate environment from the background, to a key part of the experience.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Environments: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The euphoric feeling of driving along beautiful roads laden with stunning scenery and panoramic views is one I personally love to get from a racing game. But whether your game is an open-road driving experience, or a tight, on-track trial, it’s important to get the environment surrounding the action right. It has to be the right balance between ambient and unobtrusive, with lots of fine-tuned details for the optimal driving experience – from the weather to the width of the road!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Capturing Competition: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the appeal of racing games is the desire to perform well and win. Ways to do this include having strong social mechanics, so players have the opportunity to share their wins with the world, offering plenty of achievements to be earned, or to have collectables or unlockables for players to pick up and discover. Those, combined with progression and variety, form a great foundation for a racing game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">---</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Racing games always have and always will have a huge impact on the wider games industry. Many features present in racing games have evolved to fit other genres: vehicle-based transportation (horses count!) and combat, driving mechanics, time trials… the list goes on!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s been a long road over the last 50 years for racing games and developers have learned plenty of lessons and honed their craft when it comes to creating experiences for players. As someone who has watched the genre grow throughout my career, it’s heartwarming to see not only that developers keep finding ways to make them fresh and relevant, but that players continue to welcome them with open arms.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking on these inclusions, Team Asobi's studio director <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/26/the-evolution-of-astro-bots-adorable-character-design/?sf274395215=1">Nicolas Doucet</a> explained that these characters had to have "a cool sci-fi design" but also "things like fabrics or furry boots". This meant the team "sometimes felt we might be going against the original intent of the character" and therefore Doucet said the developer "substituted more organic materials, like hair, with materials such as vinyl". Makes sense.</p>
<p>But, as with Astro Bot themselves, a lot of the character design for these cameos is about the eyes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-unveils-adorable-astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-complete-with-playful-pair-of-eyes">The eyes are "paramount"</a>, Doucet said.</p>
<p>This caused a bit of an issue with some of the "more cartoony" cameos, however, as "LED eyes just didn't work on certain characters because the original design relies so much on the pupils being a certain size or colour". As a result characters such as Crash Bandicoot's bot will instead be wearing a mask "to help bridge that problem".</p>
<p>Will it be a Zorro style band across the eyes, or more of a halloween-style pull over mask in the style of a bot? Alas, I do not know right now, but I am looking forward to finding out!</p>
<p>As for Astro Bot, a couple of us have already been hands on with the upcoming PS5 exclusive, and came away impressed. "It feels bold to say so early on, but if the demo's quality is representative of the full game, Astro Bot looks like a strong candidate for the top spot on my own game of the year list," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hands-on-with-astro-bot-creative-beautiful-and-authentically-playstation">Digital Foundry's John wrote</a> after a little hands-on time with it last month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Chris called<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-channels-the-pure-game-design-of-nintendo-as-playstation-turns-towards-families"> Astro Bot "one of the most joyful experiences of Summer Game Fest"</a> following his time with the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Disney <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/the-acolyte-canceled-no-season-2-star-wars-disney-plus-1236044233/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> <em>The Acolyte,</em> a show everyone seems to have opinions about but apparently no one really watched. If you’ve heard anything about the show, which explored a mystery surrounding the Sith’s rise to power in an era long before the prequels, it may have been about the supposed <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a> that divided so-called Star Wars fans since its season premiere in June.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Acolyte </em>was a real departure from the norm of Star Wars. Showrunner Leslye Headland created a story that engaged with the lore of the evil Sith and noble Jedi, introducing more adult themes and moral gray areas than we’ve seen in a franchise George Lucas started more than 40 years ago. It explored abuse of power and showcased nuanced BIPOC characters and a refreshing level of queerness.</p><p>All of which led to the loudest voices online deeming it “too woke,” review-bombing episodes before they even aired, and directing the kind of racist hate towards its star Amandla Stenberg that echoed what John Boyega <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/john-boyega-interview-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced</a> when he joined the sequel films starting with <em>The Force Awakens </em>in 2015. In a time when fandom has consumed culture–whether you are talking about Marvel movies, Beyonce or TV shows with dragons–over the last several years Star Wars fans have increasingly been associated with toxicity, with a vocal minority nevertheless having the power to get Disney worried.&nbsp;</p><p>After my initial shock at <em>The Acolyte</em>’s cancellation and my quick movement through several of the stages of grief, I got stuck for a while at <em>anger</em>, then <em>guilt</em>. I couldn’t help but wonder if I hadn’t been vocal enough for my opinion to matter. I’m a 40-year-old brown woman who has loved Star Wars all her life. I absolutely loved <em>The Acolyte</em>; it’s my second favorite recent installment in Star Wars next to Tony Gilroy’s <em>Andor.</em> Perhaps I should have shouted louder. I don’t need to prove my Star Wars nerd credentials to anyone, but in this current climate, in which the most vocal fans are the most regressive, maybe that’s precisely what’s required to change the perception of just who Star Wars fans are and what they look like.&nbsp;</p><p>I grew up surrounded by extended family all under the same roof, in a household that’s typical in the South Asian diaspora, whether in the UK (as I was) or elsewhere. My uncles and cousins were my gateway into Star Wars: watching <em>Return of the Jedi </em>aged four or five and living for the Ewoks. Things only accelerated for me when the original trilogy special edition was re-released in 1997. My teen years were spent lost in Expanded Universe novels and early online fan communities (Han Solo Webring, anyone?). It was a time in which I could barely dream of representation in something like Star Wars; the best was my attempts at Mary Sueing myself into the fanfiction that I <em>of course</em> wrote. While showing up to high school with my talking Stormtrooper keychain on my backpack certainly did not make me popular, Star Wars and its fandom truly helped define me in ways that I’m grateful for.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the idea of the gatekeeper existed back then. But at best, it was about knowing obscure lore, like the cargo capacity of a YT-1300 Corellian freighter, or the origins of Lando Calrissian’s administrative assistant, Lobot. It wasn’t whining over black or gay people existing in space and using the Force.</p><p>Leslye Headland is exactly the kind of showrunner and Star Wars fan the franchise needs – someone who loves the universe (Darth Plagueis!) and digs deep into lore (bleeding a kyber crystal!), but also clearly loves and understands the material enough to treat it like an <em>adult</em>—an adult who also happens to love incredible wire-work fight choreography. <em>The Acolyte</em> was a feast for those of us who had decades of theory percolating in our heads, but that doesn’t mean it was without faults. The show had some issues with pacing, the dialogue could sometimes be flat, and the story being told out of order sometimes made it confusing. However, you could argue those same risks were very Star Wars;&nbsp; telling a <em>Rashomon</em>-esque story nods to Lucas’ own <em>ahem</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160104-the-film-star-wars-stole-from" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">borrowing</a> from Kurosawa.&nbsp;</p><p>What does it mean if you can be a fan like myself, or like Headland, and have <em>The Acolyte </em>be so easily discarded, not just by so-called fans furious about its content, but by Disney? Under Disney’s stewardship, we’ve entered an era in which so many of us who loved the stories but didn’t feel represented by them could finally see ourselves in a galaxy far, far away. But Disney’s handling of these issues of representation hasn’t been a straight line; it’s gone through cycles, mirroring the way these things have also played out in wider culture.</p><p>We saw the first wave of this with Disney’s handling of the “sequel trilogy” and the frustrating cycles of hyping-then-sidelining characters played by John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran (<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/john-boyega-star-wars-racism-marginalized-1054189/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something Boyega has spoken out about</a>). But the online toxicity around Star Wars reached a crescendo with Rian Johnson’s <em>The Last Jedi </em>in 2017, notably the portrayal of&nbsp; Luke Skywalker as anything <em>but</em> The Most Special Boy, now a bitter man grappling with problematic legacies. Even white male saviors get the blues, which was apparently a bridge too far for some.&nbsp;</p><p>The toxic fan pushback against <em>The Last Jedi</em> led to the sidelining of Boyega and Tran’s characters in the final installment of the sequel trilogy, <em>Rise of Skywalker </em>in 2019, alongside a confusing reversal of many of the storylines that Rian Johnson had been setting up. With such infamously lazy examples of dialogue, as <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/somehow-palpatine-returned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“somehow, Palpatine returned,</a>" <em>The Rise of Skywalker </em>was by far the worst Star Wars movie to date. It felt like it erred on the side of nonsense just so it could take the fewest risks, a reversal of the more nuanced, progressive, and adult path that could’ve been taken.</p><p>Of course, just a year after <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> debuted, America underwent its so-called racial reckoning when the murder of George Floyd sparked widespread protests (in which John Boyega not only engaged in activism, but also during which he publicly called out Disney for his treatment), as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2021/george-floyd-corporate-america-racial-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a trend of corporations and institutions pledging a total of billions</a> to fighting racial inequity.&nbsp;</p><p>In the couple of years that followed, Disney refreshingly followed these wider commitments to diversity at the time, and came to the defense of two more of its Black actors and hosts: namely, in 2021 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55782460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when Krystina Arielle, host of official Star Wars YouTube show <em>The High Republic, </em>came under racist attack</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/moses-ingram-racist-star-wars-comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moses Ingram for her portrayal of the Sith inquisitor Reva in <em>Obi-Wan</em></a> in 2022. In both cases, Disney released statements standing by these Black women, for which <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/john-boyega-disney-defense-obi-wan-moses-ingram-racism-1235204528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Boyega even praised Disney</a>. Of course this time, when Amandla Stenberg, protagonist of <em>The Acolyte</em>, was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/20/the-acolyte-star-amandla-stenberg-slams-intolerable-racism-in-diss-track-after-weeks-of-anti-woke-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subject to the racist abuse from fans</a>, there was no such statement of defense issued from Disney or Lucasfilm; <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/the-acolyte-amandla-stenberg-song-fan-backlash-1235928616/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she was left to stand up for herself against the toxic fans</a>.</p><p>Disney’s commitments to supporting its diverse stars and creators, even in the face of vitriolic attack, has waxed and waned over the last few years, following the same pattern as the wider landscape. We’re now in an era in which there is a worrying tide of pushback against inclusion, from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/29/politics/affirmative-action-supreme-court-ruling/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">affirmative action in college admissions</a> to corporations <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90855309/what-happened-companies-commitment-dei" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abolishing DEI</a>. That so many of the diversity initiatives and supposed financial commitments that were set up in the wake of George Floyd <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/diversity-roles-disappear-three-years-george-floyd-protests-inspired-rcna72026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/08/19/silicon-valley-dei-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reversed</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaunharper/2022/10/17/where-is-the-200-billion-companies-promised-after-george-floyds-murder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaks to this too</a>, when it turned out that the work required was harder and more complex than they’d bargained for. The capitalist incentive for companies to pursue diverse representation has been well laid out many times: to expand a total addressable audience, bringing in new and untapped audiences that can <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/diversity-demand-people-color-women-audience-and-big-screen-hold-keys-industry-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look better for the bottom line</a>. Yet for many executives and investors, if these new audiences don’t materialize immediately in the face of systemic bias, <a href="https://www.reckon.news/honey/2024/01/rap-sht-ruled-out-why-bipoc-shows-keep-getting-chopped-while-whiteness-reigns-supreme.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these offerings seem quick to be dropped</a>.</p><p>We’re also in a time in which economic forces drive what gets made and who gets to make it – and one thing we know is that in a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/diversity/vc-funding-black-founded-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time of economic downtown, marginalized folks bear the brunt</a> of cuts across different sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In the games industry, there have been countless <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs and studio closures</a> over the last 12 months across the board. More recently, my own studio, Glow Up Games, has been amongst them, as we were unable to continue surviving against the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24058266/video-game-industry-funding-gap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">structural issues leading to the huge funding gap for marginalized founders</a>. Therefore, the ways in which the systems that be could do better in supporting creators telling stories outside of the mainstream feels particularly close to home for me.</p><p>There’s no one single explanation for why <em>The Acolyte </em>wasn’t renewed. The show<em> </em>was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/23/there-is-zero-reason-the-acolyte-season-2-would-need-to-cost-180-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive</a> to make, costing $180 million, and had <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-success-viewership-rotten-tomatoes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comparatively low</a> viewership against many other Disney Star Wars shows. However, comparing this to <em>Andor</em>, <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2022/10/andor-viewership-disappoints-ed1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which had an even higher budget at $250 million, and similarly low viewership</a>, it’s tough to overlook the fact that one large difference lays in how vitriolic the response to <em>The Acolyte</em> has been. It's even possible that the low viewership potentially resulted from the narrative surrounding the show.</p><p>The toxic enclaves in the Star Wars fanbase have taken <em>The Acolyte’s</em> cancellation as a win, regardless of the reason. The conversation around both the show and its cancellation has been about that fanbase, instead of a structural perspective on how to support different kinds of stories being told.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the reason for <em>The Acolyte</em>’s cancellation, Disney needs to ask itself which fans they’re validating and what stories they’re cultivating with the shows they produce and stand by. No single show, movie, or video game exists on hope or magic; they’re the work of creative people and investors with money, the place those people meet to create a vision. Institutions such as Disney need to understand that if you're going to invest in marginalized creators who are taking big swings, you need to afford them the same shape of the opportunities being given to the ‘safer bets’: <em>Andor</em>, for instance, was <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a42010654/andor-season-2-date-cast-episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly greenlit as a two-season show</a>. There needs to be a commitment to weathering the cycles of cultural pushback. This is true not just in movies or games and TV, but in any industry.</p><p><em>The Acolyte</em> felt like it was for <em>me</em>. It continued the threads that <em>The Last Jedi </em>only began to tease: the idea that the Force is much bigger than just the heroes we’ve become accustomed to seeing in Star Wars. It was a story that showed love for Star Wars while criticizing its sacred trope of the fight between space cops and space fascists. More than that, <em>The Acolyte</em> and <em>The Last Jedi</em> made a case for why expansive storytelling is critical in an era of omnipresent entertainment driven by multinational corporations, when fandoms that make space for everyone are necessary to survival.</p><p>In this time in which Star Wars is locked in an unwinnable battle over which fans <em>matter</em>, I find myself wondering what some of those other fans I was in community with as a Star Wars internet teen are doing now, especially many of those who were young women predisposed to obsessing and writing fic. Always quirky, often queer. It's <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/arts/television/leslye-headland-the-acolyte.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very likely that Lesley Headland was among them, too</a>. It feels like she was one of <em>us</em> who got just to begin telling her Star Wars story, found fans like me with whom it resonated deeply, and then had that opportunity ripped away. With every decision the company makes, Disney is telling fans, critics and shareholders what kinds of voices matter to them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/sonic-fights-keanus-shadow-in-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first trailer for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> movie has arrived, showing Team Sonic’s battle with Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/16/keanu-reeves-is-reportedly-playing-shadow-in-sonic-3-movie/">confirmed to be voiced by Keanu Reeves</a>. Sonic 3 is set to release in cinemas on 20th December 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer, but you’re probably best off not watching it if you’d like there to be any surprises left for the final film.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic the Hedgehog 3 | Official Trailer (2024 Movie) Ben Schwartz, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSu6i2iFMO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 sees Shadow unleashed upon the world, a darker counterpart to Sonic whose appearance was teased at the end of Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Would he be Robotnik’s latest lackey to get revenge on Sonic? Well, the trailer completely spoils that aspect of the story, but it’s a bit of a no-brainer that Jim Carrey’s Robotnik would return, and he’s larger than life as usual… especially with his waistline.</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves has become one of the most popular and beloved actors in Hollywood in recent times, thanks in no small part to his action-packed John Wick series, and honestly, I think he’s a great bit of casting for Shadow, thanks to the often quite neutral tone to his voice. He’s joining Idris Elba’s Knuckles, Ben Schwartz’s Sonic and Colleen O’Shaughnessey’s Tails in the recording booth, who all did a fine job for the second film.</p>

<p>Shadow’s appearance adding another layer to the franchise which has just introduced Tails and Knuckles to the film’s universe. Shadow debuted in Sonic Adventure 2 in 2001 as a new arch nemesis to Sonic with many of the same abilities and powers, but a darker and edgier tone. Shadow has since become a mainstay of the video game franchise, though as more of an antihero as opposed to a villain, even using guns in the 2005 spin-off game Shadow the Hedgehog – this was not a series highlight.</p>
<p>With almost perfect timing, Shadow is making a comeback in video games as well, with Sonic X Shadow Generations, an expanded remaster of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game with a whole new story for Shadow. We’ve just been hands on with this at Gamescom 2024 – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/sonic-x-shadows-generations-preview-what-no-guns/">read our Shadow Generations preview here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/14/best-sonic-games-top-10-movie/">The top 10 best Sonic the Hedgehog games of recent times</a></p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-review/">reviewed Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> earlier this year, giving it a great 8/10 score and saying, ”</p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog 2 kicks on from the 2020 origin story with a bigger and even more bombastic sequel, fleshing out the Sonic universe while riffing on superhero movies and globe-trotting adventures. With another film in the works (and a mid-credits scene to tease it), this blue blur is set to be a family-friendly staple for quite some time to come.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2014 <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> released the 5th edition of "The World's Greatest Roleplaying Game" and now as we wrap up 2024 players are able to get their hands on the first of the three new <em>D&amp;D 2024 Core Rulebooks</em>. The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024 Player's Handbook</em> is a reference book that allows players to learn the rules of the game and create their own character, ready to embark on an adventure!</p>
<p>For this review, we're only focusing on the <em>Player's Handbook</em>. When the 2024 <em>Dungeon Master's Guide </em>releases on November 12th, and 2024 <em>Monster Manual </em>releases on the 18th of February (in 2025) we'll be reviewing them separately.</p>
<p>The PHB is broken up into three different segments that ease the player logically into the world of <em>D&amp;D</em>, creating their characters, and then additional resources and references for items, spells, and more that the player or DM may need.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-intro.jpg?itok=gU4r4R5a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-intro.jpg?itok=El325zb1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Welcome to a whole new era of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></figcaption></figure><h2>How To Play <em>D&amp;D</em> In The Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024 Player's Handbook</h2>
<p>Opening strong, the book begins with an explanation of the History of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> how to use the book, and how to play the game.</p>
<p>Information is laid out in a logical way to provide context for the next instructions. The book describes the roles of those at the table and what kinds of adventures the party might go on before adding in information about the tools of the game (dice), how ability checks work, and how combat plays out.</p>
<p>From the third paragraph of Chapter 1 the 2024 <em>PHB</em> demonstrates one of the smart additions to the Player Handbook, scripted examples.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-roleplay-example.jpg?itok=nUYcsgaV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-roleplay-example.jpg?itok=FaUIKqpN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For those nervous to get into roleplay the book details social interactions nicely...</figcaption></figure><p>For anyone who has played <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> before, reading these rules will make sense as you have the context to frame the situations, but for a new reader wanting to understand their role as a Player and how they fit into the greater structure of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> these scripted examples do a lot of heavy lifting to introduce concepts.</p>
<p>The first example provided in the book of scripted play is a conversation between a DM and their two players. Here the DM describes a scene before the players ask to perform investigations. A nice addition here to their conversation isn't just the DM performing their roles, but also gives an example of the DM politely asking the players to not overload them with questions.</p>
<p>While there's no assumption that a player might be a problematic player, this does immediately set a tone to the players to be aware that your DM is doing a lot, and also gives DMs implicit permission that they don't always need to be responding to every players beck and call.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-combat-example.jpg?itok=ec1entlm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-combat-example.jpg?itok=5TS3q8Ml 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>...it also explains the how and why of combat</figcaption></figure><p>Later on in this chapter larger examples are provided for exploration and combat, in these we don't just get to read about the steps the DM and each player (and their character) are taking, but also we get to learn the rationale behind why they're making those decisions.</p>
<p>Some lessons that are highlighted during these examples are that it's worth rolling regardless of whether you have Proficiency, how light can alter how much you can see, and that it's important for a player to know their spells as their DM may not know them all.</p>
<p>The compression of eight pages of rules into two pages of combat example might not allow for everything to be covered, but for a new player hopping in it gives a good ground level of knowledge to then build upon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately after reading just the introductory chapter, I've been impressed about the books layout, starting with simple rules and then building upon them creates an excellent environment for learning.</p>
<p>One thing that I would have liked to see, as is common with other games where new editions expand upon previous rules, would be an indication of where something is new. While I'm very familiar with the rules of <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> I'm not going to say I know them all like the back of my hand. An indication that something has received a tweak, or is completely new would be helpful for those who aren't starting their adventures in <em>D&amp;D</em> with the <em>2024 Core Rulebooks</em>, but are interested in reviewing what's new.</p>
<p>That being said when something needs to be referenced, the book makes accessing that information easier than ever with an eighteen-page rules glossary at the back of the book. (Something that I will likely make a few copies of to always have readily available around my table)</p>
<h2>Character Creation</h2>
<p>Moving into the character creation section where in 2014<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> you'd pick your Race, then Class, with Background coming last. The new order of character creation is to pick your class, then your character Origin which is comprised of your background as well as your species.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>Contained in the 2024 <em>PHB</em> are twelve different classes, each with four available subclasses. Compared to the 2014 <em>PHB</em> (and the numerous additional sub-classes added over the past decade) there is a lot that has been paired down.</p>
<p>It was interesting reading through the sub-classes that remained (with a variety of tweaks) or the new sub-classes and how they offer brand new options for a class. The available sub-classes offer good variety in the types of archetypes that each of these classes can represent.</p>
<p>A good example of this is in Druid class. The available Circles are the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, Circle of the Sea, and Circle of the Stars. Depending on whether your druid wants to pull power from nature, from the animal inhabitants of the land, from the water of the world, or from the stars each is its own different take on playing a Druid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-druid-wildshape.jpg?itok=VZDN04bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-druid-wildshape.jpg?itok=9NvCFgOW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The druid changes are the only ones I feel missed the mark</figcaption></figure><p>These more unique identities from the classes help to make each character more unique in comparison to another, especially when you then factor in the differences that an Origin adds.</p>
<p>For the types of abilities you'll be obtaining through both your class and sub-class I was excited to read most of them. In terms of the overall vibe of the character customization changes in relation to Class and Sub-Class I'd be excited as a player to be rolling up a D&amp;D 2024 character.</p>
<p>In terms of abilities getting downgrades, I believe it's the Druid who has suffered the worst overall. Wildshape, a mechanic that's core to the druid experience, is being altered to be far less powerful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will still take on the physical traits and attacks of a beast that you wildshape into, but instead of using their HP as your own you will instead gain Temp HP equivalent to your druid level.</p>
<p>Wildshaping might offer a better AC than your standard form, but you won't get to have the entirety of the animal's HP on top of your own to survive with. A Crocodile's 13 HP might not be a lot, but for a squishy druid at level 4 it's far better than 4 Temp HP.</p>
<h4>Multiclassing</h4>
<p>A table for multi-classing spellcasters has been added that allows for fans of picking up multiple forms of spellcasting to have a better time with. To use this table you add up the levels of your different classes, some classes count for less of a level such as a Paladin being ½ a level and an Arcane Trickster being 1/3rd a level.</p>
<p>This lets you know that if you have three levels as an Arcane Trickster and 4 levels as a Bard you'd be level 5 on the Multiclass Spellcaster table.</p>
<h3>Origins &amp; Species</h3>
<p>Origins have taken over from the place of Backgrounds. Each Origin now influences a number of character traits that had previously been attributed to your race (now species) such as which Ability Scores you have proficiency in, your skill and tool proficiencies, and your starting equipment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-origin.jpg?itok=CBWvUIEF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-origin.jpg?itok=8s5DVbgu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every Origin features relevant artwork and the game mechanic information&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Origins also all provide a special feat that is specific to your Origin that has been designed to be useful to your character throughout their whole career.</p>
<p>With 16 Origins, each holding more weight on the build of your character it allows for a lot more versatility within the character.</p>
<p>For 2014 <em>D&amp;D</em> if you and a friend were both an Arcane Trickster there wouldn't be too much variance between your characters if you selected a different background. With Origins an Arcane Trickster that is an Entertainer vs an Arcane Trickster that is a Wayfarer will be more distinct.</p>
<p>Part of putting more mechanical weight on Class/Sub-Class and Origin is that it frees up the Species to have more variety outside of the mechanics. Your Goliath doesn't need to be the biggest and beefiest warrior on the block, they can have studied books all their lives and it won't be going against their entire way of life.</p>
<p>I enjoy this redistribution of mechanics and roleplay as a way to create more meaningful permutations of different characters. It allows the book to present to me only 48 sub-classes, but allow for thousands of character variants before we even get into roleplay decisions.</p>
<h2>Spells, Components, and Summoning</h2>
<p>A lot of the spells in the 2024 <em>PHB</em> have been altered in slight ways. Spotchecking a variety of spells that I know my players and I commonly uses I've found tweaks as small as altered wordings, while other spells add or remove entire aspects of the ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-spell-list.jpg?itok=5S7uugDa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-spell-list.jpg?itok=2R-YodWa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look closely as there are many slight differences</figcaption></figure><p>A quick example of this would be that Faerie Fire acts the exact same, Goodberry changes from being able to choose to create up to 10 vs 2024 always making 10, and Power Word Kill now does 12d12 damage if the target is above 100 HP.</p>
<p>Most of the spell changes that I've read have been -- at the very least -- positive for a player, if not an overall improvement. As so many of these changes are so slight whether you like, dislike, or are ambivalent to these changes will really be up to the player/those at the table.</p>
<h2>Monster Stat Blocks</h2>
<p>As a forever DM one of the nicest aspects of the <em>2024 PHB</em> is the insight that it offers to creature statblocks. Inside the <em>PHB</em> there are stat blocks for beasts for Druids to Wildshape into, creatures that can be summoned, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-stat-block.jpg?itok=TAuczE_C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-stat-block.jpg?itok=4gKBZDJY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>And yes, the cat now has darkvision</figcaption></figure><p>With the updated look important information like the creatures AC, HP, Initiative, and Speed are clearly laid out at the top of the stat block. We also get a detailed break down of the creatures stats, what their base modifier would be for anything, as well as their saves.</p>
<p>This quick glance to find the same info in the exact same place, and the math already being done helps to alleviate stresses for DMs and players alike, especially as they're summoning or transforming any of these creatures.</p>
<h2>Controversy! The Confused Loxodon In The Room</h2>
<p>Ultimately reading over the rules of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook</em> has felt most comparable to reading through the changelog of a video game. There's plenty of balancing going on, new abilities appearing while old ones change or potentially even disappear.</p>
<p>While I've enjoyed the vast majority of the updates provided by this <em>PHB</em> it rests in a strange place that it's not a full step to a new edition, and it's not even a half-step like we've seen<em> D&amp;D</em> take before.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-2024-phb-comparisons.jpg?itok=vyolYifa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-2024-phb-comparisons.jpg?itok=NvUi4bP2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new Fighter class page from the 2024 PHB laid over the 2014 PHB</figcaption></figure><p>As a book of mostly backward-compatible errata, there's a sense of hesitancy that all players can feel from Wizards of the Coast, that they don't want to create a new edition and lose the fanbase that has been very publicly growing but that they want to continue to update it.</p>
<p>This messaging has resulted in a situation that ultimately makes it harder for those who play the game. If I'm playing in multiple tables, I will invariably have some questions: which rules are they using? Would cherry-picking certain rules and spells make the players or the DM too powerful? How much 'fixing' of things does a DM need to perform to make the game feel fun? What's the impact of one player using 2014 abilities and another is using 2024 abilities?</p>
<p>For a casual table like mine, I don't imagine we'll have much issue progressing forward into these new rules tweaks during, or at the conclusion of our current campaign… but that doesn't change the fact that I've dedicated quite some time looking at builds and compatibility to reach that conclusion.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy the 2024 Player's Handbook?</h2>
<p>As a standalone product, a book that any person can buy off the street to learn how to be a player of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</em> I think this book absolutely nails what it's going for. Throughout the course of the book, you'll be taught, with plenty of examples, how to play the game. You'll be able to create characters that offer greater variety in gameplay mechanics with the new Origin system, and you'll learn all you need to about the different feats, spells, magic items, and more.</p>
<p>If you're happy with what you already have available to you with the 2014 Player Handbook and all of the expansions that have since been released though a lot of what you'll find here are changes, that I mostly found were improvement, with a few completely new elements.</p>
<p>By finding this weird place of not being a full or even half step the 2024 PHB would be my recommendation for a new player, but for someone who owns all the books you can likely wait until more of the core books, or even a few adventures have been released before you look at this more seriously.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting, and slightly complicated review to work through. While there's a lot going on in the almost 400 pages that is the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player's Handbook</em> the majority of it is small alterations if you compare it to what's previously been available.</p>
<p>Unless you're picking apart spells and comparing them you might not even notice or realize some of the subtle changes that are taking place. I can imagine for many you might end up unintentionally gaslighting yourself or suffer from the mandela effect when a spell comes up in a game and you just can't be certain if it's changed or not.</p>
<p>As a player the options that I have seen excite me, while the majority might not be entirely new sub-classes altering the way you play the game completely there's enough there to optimize or improve play. Of course, my heart does go out to the druid fans for such an incredible blow.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing what kinds of changes there are for <em>D&amp;D 5e</em> in this weird "update that isn't meant to be an update" then it's a fun book to pick up, but for the time being and immediate future it's likely not going to be a 'must have' at anyone's table.</p>

            <p>Nintendo Direct brings us a gift, and one in the form of exciting news about history's most squirrel stuffed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s. Can you really claim 108 characters when five of them are flying squirrels with different colour capes? Never mind all that. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars has a new release date: March 6, 2025.</p>
<p>I’ll get into details in a minute, but since it came up in Slack chat earlier, I’d first like to share with you the differences between the 1995 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>’s EU PS1 one cover art:</p>

</figure>
<p>Truly, astonishing stuff.</p>
<p>The remaster was originally set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-two-classic-suikoden-rpgs-are-coming-to-pc-as-an-hd-remaster">release last year</a> after being announced by Konami at the 2022 Tokyo Game Show, but never materialised. Today, we finally got a new date locked down via Nintendo Direct. Here’s the latest trailer:</p>
<figure>

<p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/">Steam page</a> highlights the following details:</p>
<blockquote><p>・All background illustrations have been upgraded to HD</p>
<p>・Updated effects breathe new life into the pixel art animation</p>
<p>・New environmental sounds effects to immerse yourself in this fantasy world</p>
<p>・Battle SFX are also now HD and add a new level of realism</p>
<p>・Newly added auto-save</p>
<p>・Battle Fast Forward</p>
<p>・Conversation Log</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a bit more detail on a few of these items in the Ninty trailer. Battles can now be bumped to 2x or 4x speed, and there's also single-button autobattle option - although I swear this was in the menu in the original anyway. Another detail the Steam page doesn’t mention: getting these both in a single package hopefully means the games carrying your save over will be nicely painless. It wasn’t too impactful, but there are a few secrets you can unlock in the second game if you’ve fully completed the first.</p>
<p>As Brendy will tell you from the time I tried to cram a Suikoden bit in his best JRPGs list despite them not being out on PC yet, these games are incredibly special to me. Everything I’ve seen so far seems positive. I don’t actually know what an ‘emu-lator’ is, but this seems like a far easier way to play them on modern hardware than enlisting the help of an emu.</p>
<p>If you need something to keep you going until next March, there’s always spiritual successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a>. “A turn-based JRPG that accommodates those familiar with Suikoden or those who don't know what a Suikoden is,” wrote Edders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-review">his review</a>. “Embrace the old-school quirks and there's a wonderful journey to be had here.”</p>
<p>Eiyuden director and Suikoden co-creator Yoshitaka Murayama sadly passed away earlier this year, though I do find it heartening that he got to see just how much Suikoden meant to people when Eiyuden smashed its Kickstarter goals.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former Call of Duty: Black Ops Executive Producer has joined Sony to work on a brand new game with Bungie for PlayStation.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/GirlGlitcher/status/1828312905097302244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GirlGlitcher</a>, Jason Blundell has taken on a role as the head of a new studio within Sony. This studio is developing a new game alongside Destiny 2 developer Bungie that is “an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe”.</p>







<p>The claim says that Bungie had been working on this game already before Blundell’s arrival, and, likely, before Sony started restructuring the studio. It was also doubled down that it’s not in the Destiny or Marathon franchise. </p>



<p>Blundell spent over a decade at Treyarch working on Call of Duty before leaving in 2020 to form his own studio, Deviation Games. Deviation was working on a new game for PlayStation Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deviation-games-hit-with-layoffs-with-playstation-game-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before it was hit with layoffs</a> and ultimately shut down in March 2024. Blundell had left Deviation in September 2022.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time since Blundell left Deviation that he was linked with Sony. Back in May, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-sony-forms-new-studio-of-former-deviation-games-devs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it was reported</a> that Sony had formed a new studio with former Deviation employees to work on an unannounced IP. It has yet to be confirmed that Blundell was working with this new studio, though all signs point to that <a href="https://x.com/JCbackfire/status/1736852589927702938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being the case</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony and Bungie for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

Today's double-feature of a Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase and Indie World brought a smattering of new announcements, as the Switch heads into its final Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
The shows were light on any real bombshells, perhaps to be expected with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> on the horizon. But in their place there was still plenty to keep you busy over the coming six months, with eye-catching indie games, retro game collections and a wave of ports.
</p>
<p>
You can watch the full show below, or recap it announcement by announcement underneath.

Moving over to games with bigger budgets, the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase began with... Tetris! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-is-getting-the-interactive-documentary-treatment-from-atari-50-studio-this-winter">In time for the game's 40th anniversary, Tetris Forever includes a raft of classic Tetris games</a> (Tetris! Tetris 2 + Bombliss! Tetris Battle Gaiden!) plus a new Tetris "experience" named Tetris Time Warp where you play as one of several classic Tetris styles at the same time. It's due later this year. (And also NES Tetris is coming to Nintendo Switch Online this winter.)

            <p>Amazon Prime Gaming is offering members the chance to scoop up three games set in Lord of the Rings' Middle-earth at no additional cost.</p>
<p>This latest promotion is all to celebrate the second season premiere of The Rings of Power on Amazon, which starts on 29th August.</p>
<p>The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Lego The Lord of the Rings, via GOG code</li>
<li>Middle-earth: Shadow of War, on Amazon Luna via the Prime Gaming offer wherever Luna is available</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite fond of the Lego games, so would recommend giving that a go if you haven't yet. Also, unlike the Lego Hobbit games, the Lego Lord of the Rings includes the whole story.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-review">Lego Lord of the Rings review from 2012</a> (again, what is time?!) called it "charming and delightful, faithful to the source yet cheekily irreverent, and packed with features that feed into each other in satisfying ways". In fact, Dan Whitehead said it marked "another highpoint in the Lego series".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home?filter=Game&amp;ref_=SM_FreeGameswithPrime2023_PRA">find more details on Amazon's Lord of the Rings game promotion here</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann recently said the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">still trying to find the "hook" for its Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, stating the team doesn't "just want to go and do the same thing over" with its Middle-earth game.</p>
<p>"While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there," Hartmann said. "So it's a little bit early."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For all the years of build up and anticipation, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/starfield">Starfield’s</a> launch last September didn’t exactly set the world alight. It took a bold step into sci-fi with its interstellar adventure, but felt like it didn’t quite explore its galaxy of possibilities as fully as it could have done. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/starfield-shattered-space-dlc-revealed-coming-to-xbox-and-pc-later-this-year/">Launching on 30th September, Starfield: Shattered Space</a>, the first big expansion for the game, looks set to take one of the dangling threads of potential and head down a dark and twisted rabbit hole.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starfield: Official REV-8 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rA1z1DbA_Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the version of Starfield that shipped, you can see the vestigial remnants of some of the many gameplay experiments and ideas that Bethesda explored through the game’s eight years of development. Some remain as gameplay elements with little meaningful purpose, like building bases to refine fuel for space travel that was eventually made practically limitless, while others were left as dangling threads waiting to be revisited, like House Va’ruun.</p>


<p>This bunch of fanatical space serpent worshippers were easily one of the most enigmatic aspects of the main game. Ostensibly one of the biggest factions in the Settled Systems, alongside the United Colonies and FreeStar Collective, they were almost nowhere to be seen, outside of historical context and having Andreja as one of your possible companions. The presence of Va’ruun’kai, their homeworld, was kept a closely guarded secret as they retreated into isolation.</p>
<p>Also weird as heck experiments. Shattered Space reveals the location of Va’ruun’kai and the capital city of Dazra in the wake of a reality tearing experiment by their leading scientists, with extra-dimensional beings flooding through.</p>


<p>Va’ruun’kai promises to be a dark and unsettling locale to explore, the planet shrouded in deep, dark reds and purples from its sky that lend it a deeply ominous tone, while Dazra itself has been engulfed in a spatial anomaly and surrounded by a suspended explosion. Still, Dazra is basically the one safe place left on the planet, with the Va’ruun evacuating other settlements and places from across the planet to reach its relative safety.</p>
<p>House Va’ruun is threatened on all sides, the most eye-catching being the enemies that can burst out from another reality, whether they’re new long-limbed bugs or humanoids that are reminiscent of Spider-Man villain Mister Negative or Destiny’s Taken. There’s the potential to explore some real cosmic horrors through this rend in time and space that they’ve created, especially if Bethesda choose to reveal more about the Great Serpent itself.</p>

<p>While the trailers look to lean in on the horror aspect, I’m not sure the expansion will really be all that terrifying. Battling these enemies, Bethesda is pushing the combat in a subtly different direction that might ramp up the pressure and challenge you in different ways. There could be more zero-G battles, you’ll have more hostiles to deal with when exploring the wider surface of Va’ruun’kai and you’ll probably want the Rev-8 to help outrun things, but also there’s a shifting emphasis on enemies that will bullrush you and try to get within melee range. If you went through the main game hunkering down behind cover constantly, that might no longer be an option in Shattered Space as you’re pushed to stay mobile and make use of the jet pack.</p>
<p>However, just as impactful to this expansion will be the threats to House Va’ruun from within. There’s a power vacuum at the top of this space empire and all of the sub-factions and lesser figures are vying to step up to the big time. You’ll no doubt have a hand in deciding you gets to lead House Va’ruun into the future, and there will no doubt be the full gamut of reasonable leaders and full-on galaxy destroying nutters.</p>

<p>With the galaxy of systems and planets already generated, Bethesda’s expansions to Starfield can take on a much more hand-crafted approach. Shattered Space is the first fruits of this labour, building within this established framework to expand the universe narrative and make this a game worth revisiting.</p>

			<p>After months of silence, <a href="https://wccftech.com/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars</a> has finally resurfaced, and with a final release date to boot.</p>
<p>In today's Nintendo Partner Direct, it has been confirmed that the collection featuring the first two entries in the beloved JRPG series by Konami will be released on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. Konami has yet to confirm the release date for PC and PlayStation consoles, but it will likely be the same as the Nintendo Switch release. A new trailer showcasing some of the remasters' features was also shared online, and you can find it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Suikoden I&amp;II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4m7YHLlDq40?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As showcased in the trailer above, Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars will come with plenty of improvements over the original releases, such as enhanced visuals featuring pixel sprites and environments with new screen effects and shadow animations, redone character portraits and more. The two games will both receive some gameplay improvements and new quality-of-life features such as a dialogue log, auto-battle, the ability to speed up battles, and more. For the rest, it will be the same classic JRPGs that fans have come to love. The second game, in particular, is considered by many the best entry in the series and one of the best JRPGs ever released, thanks to its excellent story and gameplay.</p>
<p>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune And Dunan Unification Wars launches on March 6th on Nintendo Switch. The game should be released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on the same day.</p>
