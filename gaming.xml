            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-ukraine-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1121391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Ukraine has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Ukraine' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Ukraine).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time since MercurySteam released an original game, but the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review/1900-6416751/" data-ref-id="1900-6416751">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> has finally revealed a first look at its upcoming dark fantasy action-RPG Blades of Fury. In the announcement trailer below, players are introduced to Aran de Lira as he prepares to face his destiny head-on against some dangerous foes. Luckily for Aran, he's well-armed with weapons of his own creation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOrS00j1Zo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8WOrS00j1Zo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the game's backstory, Aran is the firstborn of the King's Ward, and he's forced to take a stand after the recently crowned Queen Nerea uses dark magic to solidify her power in the kingdom. Thanks to Nerea's spell, all steel in the kingdom has been turned to stone, and only the evil creatures at her command have the divine metal that can obliterate any normal weapon used against them.</p><p>That's why Aran will have to forge his own weapons to counter the divine metal's power, and there are several different weapons that can be chosen. Players will have to determine which weapons are most effective against the wide variety of monsters they encounter in the game. Picking the wrong weapon could have grave consequences and leave Aran unable to defeat his foes.</p><p>MercurySteam has teased that certain details about the story will be unknown, and "you will know only what our heroes know; your intuition and courage must fill in the rest." Thankfully, Aran doesn't have to figure it all out for himself. His companion, Adso, can aid him during battles with suggestions about how to defeat the creatures. Adso also speaks the language of the ancient forger, which will come in handy as they brave dangerous castles and mazes.</p><p>Blades of Fire will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via the Epic Games Store on May 22.</p>

Thanks to some internal upheaval and an inflexible release schedule, the <em>Civilization VII </em>we all started playing earlier this month felt more like a playtest than a finished product. </p><p>The user interface, for example, had been completely overhauled relatively close to release, and just wasn't ready! And loads of other quality of life features that you expect from <em>Civ</em>, and that have shipped with previous games at launch, were also missing. </p><p>To give you an idea of just how incomplete <em>Civilization VII </em>was upon release, take a look at this roadmap for future updates Firaxis released today:</p><figure></figure><p>The fact "additional UI updates &amp; polish" is listed <em>four times</em>, one of them simply in the "more to come" timeframe, should give you an idea of how underbaked the game's menus and information screens are at the moment, and how much more time this game needed in the oven before being released.</p><p>Other coming additions, like auto-exploring, "quick move functionality" and the ability to rename your cities, are also Civ stalwarts that have featured in previous games at launch, and were extremely notable by their absence in <em>Civ VII</em>.</p><p>I want to be clear,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like I tried to with my impressions of the game</a>, that a lot of these problems aren't the fault of the <em>team</em>. Games change and evolve and throw out ideas all the time, that's game development. What stings here is that <em>Civ VII</em> was rushed out onto the market before some major changes were actually <em>finished</em>, which for the price 2K were asking--$70 in the US, an incredible AUD$120 here--is some bullshit.</p><p>Maybe by April enough of those updates will have been polished to make the game worth a revisit? That said, given how much work lies ahead, those holding out for a drastically-improved experience might be better served waiting for "beyond". </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Velan Studios, the team behind the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-to-shutdown-in-june-private-server-version-incoming">sadly ill-fated Knockout City</a>, has announced its PlayStation-published pitch-black FPS Midnight Murder Club is launching into PC and PS5 early access on 13th March. And as an added incentive to make a purchase, up to five friends can play for free.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club sets players loose in the pitch-black interior of Wormwood Manor - arming them with a revolver and flashlight, and then challenging them to be the last person standing. "You sprint toward your friends' shouting voices echoing through the mansion, only to bump into someone else hiding in a dark corner!", Velan enthuses in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/midnight-murder-club-early-access-dated-wildcards-mode-and-guest-pass-detailed/">bout of scene-setting on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Shots ring out, luring the other hunters to your location. Every flash of light is the promise of a deadly firefight."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club's choatic action comes in five distinct flavours. There's a Free for All mode, as well as Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, Headhunters, and the newly announced Wildcards mode. This last one lets everyone play cards in their collection to twist the rules of a match - perhaps giving participants super speed or causing them to explode in a fiery ball on death - with new cards unlocking once the match is over.

<p>
Perhaps the most notable aspect of today's announcement, however, is the news purchasers can invite their friends to play along at no extra cost. Friends will first need to download the free Midnight Murder Club Guest Pass Edition, and after that, purchasers can invite up to five of them to play public or private matches, in all current game modes, as much as they want.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Murder Club launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698870/Midnight_Murder_Club/">Steam</a> and PlayStation 5 early access on 13th March, and will cost $19.99 USD for the full game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-streamers-make-money-even-new/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-is-going-to-allow-every-streamer-to-make-money-even-new-users.1121295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-streamers-make-money-even-new/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The CEO of Twitch, Dan Clancy, posted a recent update on the site’s blog page detailing some <strong>major </strong>changes coming to the platform. One of the most monumental points was around monetisation, which has long been a sticking point for streamers on the site.</p>



<p>It was revealed that in 2025, <strong>every streamer, </strong>regardless of their status, will be able to earn via subscriptions and ‘bits’. These features have, until now, been locked behind the ‘Affiliate’ wall, but this year, <strong>everyone </strong>will be able to take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Does this devalue becoming a Twitch Affiliate? Perhaps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-are-a-coming">Changes Are A-Coming</h2>



<p>In the post on the <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch Blog</a>, the company’s CEO wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you’re just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while.</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2025, we’re excited to open up monetization tools—subscriptions and bits—to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage.</li>



<li>We’re also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>If you join Twitch <strong>right now</strong>, you’ll need to become an Affiliate streamer before you can accept bits and subscriptions. That means you need to jump through a few hoops first.</p>



<p>These new terms will mean that anyone can earn on Twitch regardless of their follower count or stream time.</p>



<p>The ‘most streamers’ clause is interesting, though. I’d assume it’s put there to suggest that streamers with infractions on their account can’t take advantage of these features.</p>



<p>Twitch is also preparing to offer more sponsorship opportunities to creators, and in 2025, the site wants to run more promotional events. </p>



<p>This year, it’s all about collaboration, and that’s reflected in pending changes being made to ‘Shared’ features, such as Hype Trains, Stream Together, and Shared Chat. It was also revealed in the blog post that mobile viewing is getting an upgrade, enhancing the options available to users consuming content via a mobile device.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>clips </strong>will be upgraded, with creators unlocking more ways to edit and share their content as quickly as possible across a diversified portfolio of platforms.</p>



<p>I hate to admit it, but this update is a massive W for Twitch.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-steam-next-fest-demos-to-play-right-now.1121292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/10-steam-next-fest-february-2025-demos-to-play-right-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam Next Fest is the all-digital event where you can play literally hundreds of demos on Steam for free, so you can find your next favorite game. But with so many demos to play and the event lasting only a week – it ends 3 March at 10am PT – it can be daunting to know where to start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's team has been downloading and trying out the best and most interesting demos, which we've compiled below. It's not a comprehensive list of everything to check out, more a starter list of demos you should definitely go to first and, if you want more, well, there’s hundreds of others to choose from.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Train 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I still play the Monster Train daily challenges on my phone to this day, and I’d just finished one when the announcement of Monster Train 2 and the demo popped up. So I was pre-grabbed on the roguelike, deck-building fantasy game series. But so far I like what I’m seeing of the sequel. It’s not a radical reinvention of the idea, but it’s layering on some new stuff like equipment and room cards where you have to upgrade on the fly moore, and building resources like Dragon’s Hoard and Valor are different enough from the original that it’s refreshing - <em>Dan Stapleton</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Dark Deity 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like Fire Emblem, you’ll like Dark Deity 2. As somebody who enjoyed the first game despite its rough edges, the second game is shaping up to be a significant improvement with even more room for player creativity. The standout feature is build flexibility, as each unit has four mid-tier classes and an additional four high-level classes. My personal favorite unit is the hunter who is given the choice of an orangutan, toad, lion, or hyena to fight with them. The story has you playing as the children of the first game's protagonist. I really enjoyed the sibling dynamic, along with Alden, a returning character acting as the chill uncle. The demo also showed off some early choices with branching paths which is promising for a more memorable and replayable adventure. - <em>Eric Zalewski</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Out of Sight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In Out of Sight you play as Sophie, a blind girl who’s trapped in a mansion and trying to escape. You see through the eyes of her teddy bear and you have to guide her through environmental puzzles to help her escape the building, while avoiding the adults who want to keep her there. Sophie carries the teddy (you) much of the time, giving you a first-person perspective as you play. But in order to climb or manipulate items in the environment, she has to set you down, shifting the perspective to third-person. It’s a clever trick that adds to the off-kilter vibes of this creepy puzzle game that reminds me of parts of Resident Evil 7, but with enough new ideas to make it worth a look. - <em>Chris Reed</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monaco 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can never rely on your friends, but sometimes that’s what makes hanging out with them so fun and funny. That’s a big reason why Monaco 2 is so much fun. It’s a co-op stealth experience where you’ll have to rely on your teammates to not get caught, and react accordingly when they inevitably do. Monaco 2 isn’t the next live service phenomenon, but when you’re itching for a new game to get deep into with your friends, it’ll be there for you. It’s got fun and often hilarious stealth mechanics, tons of ways to strategize, and an aesthetic that brings everything together. It’s definitely not one you’ll be able to enjoy on your own though, but who’d want to do a heist on their own anyway? - <em>Tyler Robertson</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: Humble Games is the publisher of Monaco 2 and shares a parent company with IGN.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Everhood 2</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Everhood, released in 2021, was an incredible indie mashup of Undertale, Yume Nikki, and Guitar Hero that asked players to meditate on life, death, and existence in a trippy, mushroom-filled world. I loved it, and it had absolutely no business getting a sequel. Yet here we are, and I'm already hooked by whatever the heck is going on in Everhood 2. The dance battles are better than ever, its wacky cast has me constantly on my toes, and I have no idea where this wild story about soul weapons and mind dragons is going but I am absolutely buckled up for the ride. - <em>Rebekah Valentine</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Haste: Broken Worlds</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the speed of a 3D Sonic game with stylings that seem to have come out of a Dreamcast launch title, Haste: Broken Worlds might just be it. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around landing perfectly on the back edge of slopes in order to fill a meter that lets you give yourself more hangtime. From the short amount of time I’ve spent with it, it seems to nail the “just barely hanging on” nature of the good “Fast Games.” The soundtrack is also a bop. - <em>Aaron Barrier</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Skin Deep</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Skin Deep is the perfect marriage of immersive problem solving and slapstick humor that has you protecting a spaceship crew of cats from strange pirates who also want you very dead. Much of Skin Deep's charm comes from just rolling with the absurdity of it all: Don't think too hard about why you're the lone unarmed human insurance agent on a ship of tiny felines, or why the pirates' heads slowly float back to respawn points when killed. How you defeat the armed pirates while sneaking through the sandbox-like spaceships is entirely up to you, but what really makes Skin Deep stand out is how all of your tools can also be hazards. Pepper can stun foes, but also gives away your position if you sneeze. Windows into space can be broken to create new entry points, but leave glass shards to slice up your feet. The dynamic of what helps you can also hurt you sets the stage for some truly hilarious bouts of unintended consequences that I cannot get enough of. - <em>Brendan Graeber</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Teenage Mutant Ninja Tturtles: Tactical Takedown </h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who LOVES the Turtles, but has never fully fallen in love with a turn-based tactics game, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown has the sauce. Fast, fluid actions taking place right as you hit the button make it feel less turn-based than other tactical games, and the potential of its story makes it one of my most anticipated games of the moment. Some fonts and UI elements need some work, but that’s why it’s a demo! That’s what Next Fest is for. - <em>Tyler Robertson</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Promise Mascot Agency</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Described as an “open-world narrative adventure mascot management simulator, “Promise Mascot Agency feels like a Yakuza side-quest, partly because it kind of is. Playing as an exiled Yakuza member named Michi, your new job is to help a cutesy mascot agency find financial success by hiring different mascots and sending them out to events where they can be as cute as they can be, bring in more fans, and unlock more jobs. It’s a very madcap kind of game combining the numbers go up stonks feeling of a management sim, but with the sense of humor and style of cult-Japanese games like Yakuza and No More Heroes. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Labyrinth of the Demon King</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a sucker for old-school, first-person dungeon crawlers and Labyrinth of the Demon King certainly scratches that itch. Developed by a lone developer, Labyrinth of the Demon King is a throwback to games like King’s Field, but with splashes of J-Horror like Siren thrown in for good measure. As a lowly footsoldier to your lord, you decide to enter the nightmarish realm of the demon king to try and avenge your master. But the hellish monsters and a nightmarish version of feudal Japan might not be worth your honor. Great visuals, classic vibes, and a lot of style makes this one demo to keep an eye on. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are just some of the demos we’re playing at this Steam Next Fest. Check out the games on our list and, again, there are hundreds of game demos currently available to play on Steam Next Fest until March 3. So let us know in the comments which demos you're playing.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, we got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-trailer-reveals-rooftop-running-gameplay-and-late-2025-release-window">first lengthy look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, Game Freak's futuristic new Pokémon game set in the familiar Pokémon X/Y locale of Lumiose City. But even though we saw a number of features such as running on rooftops, changes to battling, and Mega Evolution, we still have loads of questions about exactly when Pokémon Legends Z-A takes place relative to the other Pokémon games, and which returning characters we might see in Lumiose City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where the community comes in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, while most Pokémon games tend to be standalone affairs, the first Pokémon Legends game dealt with time travel. It also heavily featured familiar locations from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl set hundreds of years in the past, numerous characters who were clearly ancestors of characters in other Pokémon games...or, in one case, just a Pokémon Black and White character plopped down in the past by Pokémon God themself. With that in mind, fans are eager to know when Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set, if there are any time traveling shenanigans, and if we'll see any familiar faces in Lumiose City whenever this game takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the last few hours since the trailer debuted, fans have been combing it for connections to other Pokémon games...and they've found a surprising amount. The most obvious connection is the presence of AZ, which is called out directly in the trailer. AZ is a character who was granted immortality 3000 years before the events of Pokémon X and Y, so it makes sense that regardless of when Z-A takes place, he'd be around. In Z-A, he seems to run a hotel in Lumiose City, and he looks a lot happier now that he's been reunited with his beloved Floette.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are far more subtle ties. One of my favorites that fans have discovered is the potential presence of the Looker Bureau in Z-A. Looker is a fan-favorite detective character who first appeared in Pokémon Black and White, but has since made appearances in several other games. Several eagle-eyed fans have noticed that one office shown in the trailer looks nearly identical to the Looker Bureau in past games, which they believe confirms the presence of either Looker or his protege Emma in Z-A's Lumiose City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another really bonkers theory floating around is the connection between the two main protagonists and some other familiar faces. Now that we've got full character art for the protagonists of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, fans have pointed out that the two characters look suspiciously similar to Ethan and Lyra, the two player characters from Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. This has led to speculation that Legends: Z-A may feature a time traveling scenario where Ethan and Lyra are pulled out of their version of Johto and sent to a futuristic Lumiose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But another interesting, protagonist-related theory suggests a different origin story. Fans are also pointing out that the pair look somewhat similar to Kalos Pokémon scientist Professor Sycamore and the mother of the protagonist in Pokémon X and Y, named Grace. This one, especially the bit involving Grace, is a bit more of a stretch, but still a super interesting theory in light of past plays on ancestry in the Legends series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's most curious about all those theories is that some version of them could all be true at the same time. As multiple fans have pointed out, we have absolutely no idea where Pokémon Legends Z-A takes place in the timeline. Pokémon games over the years have had a very loosely sequential timeline that also occasionally involves alternate realities (don't worry about it, it's fine) and, again as in the case of Legends: Arceus, time travel back to the past. If AZ is running a hotel, fans are pointing out that this game must take place after the events of Pokémon X and Y.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's possible that could mean hundreds of years after, given AZ's immortality. The greatest evidence of this is Lumiose City itself, which is ginormous and futuristic in Legends Z-A in a way that would have taken decades to build. If that's true and this takes place that far into the future, that would mean the two protagonists, as well as whoever is running the Looker Bureau, are descedents several generations down the line of the characters they resemble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one more character that fans are obsessing over, and that's this creepy woman from the key art:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This woman looks like a Hex Maniac, which was a trainer type that appeared in Pokémon X and Y. While a number of returning trainer types have been spotted in today's news, this girl is particularly interesting due to an ongoing Pokémon mystery: the Ghost Girl.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pokémon X and Y, there's a <a href="https://gaming-urban-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Lumiose_City_Ghost" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scene you can view</a> by entering a building in Lumiose City and heading up to the second floor. When you arrive, the lights will flash, the music will stop, and a Hex Maniac will appear behind you, glide toward the front of the screen, and say, "No, you're not the one," before disappearing. It's a weird, creepy scene that to this day has absolutely no explanation. This girl is never seen again, does not unlock anything, and just appears to be a strange easter egg. So because that Hex Maniac has remained a mystery for years, the sight of one creepily wandering around Lumiose in Legends Z-A has a lot of fans hopeful this thread might finally lead somewhere. After all, if she's a ghost, she could have continued to haunt that building for hundreds of years...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming days, there will almost certainly be more new discoveries, easter eggs, and connections found throughout all the footage, art, and news we received today about Pokémon Legends: Z-A. We have a bit of a wait for the game's release, as it's currently planned for "late 2025." But in the meantime at least we have lots of new information to obsess over.

            <p>
PUBG creator Brendan Greene's "ambitious" three-game project will soon get underway with the launch of Prologue: Go Wayback! in "Q2" this year. And in the run up to the survival game's release, Greene's studio PlayerUnknown Productions has shared a first trailer.
</p>
<p>
For some backstory, Greene <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-announces-three-game-plan-one-of-which-has-a-demo-that-you-can-play-today">unveiled his studio's three-game plan last December</a>, explaining that each project would build on the last, culminating in something called Project Artemis. That started with last year's early access release of Preface: Undiscovered World - not one of Greene's three planned games, but rather an "immersive tech demo" giving players the opportunity to explore an Earth-scale world generated by machine learning agents in real-time.
</p>
<p>
With that project now out in the wild, things are about to step up a notch with the release of Prologue: Go Wayback!. This builds on last year's tech demo by introducing more traditional survival game elements into a wilderness generated by machine learning - enabling "millions" of maps and delivering what's being described as a self-contained "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre".

<p>
Go Wayback! promises a world where "emergent systems subtly influence gameplay", with players needing to brave unpredictable weather and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to reach the Weather Station and call for help to escape the wilderness. To that end, they'll begin with an old, weathered map and essential tools, utilising resources, foraging for food, making repairs, and building shelters to improve their chances of survival.
</p>
<p>
"No one will tell you where to go or how to survive," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">explains the blurb on Steam</a>. "There are no hand-holding mechanics, no fixed paths, and no guarantees. It's a world where preparation is key, and improvisation is often the difference between life and death." That's about all the information shared so far, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI6H_WNHUlU">Prologue: Go Wayback!'s first trailer</a>, which you can see above, gives an approximate idea of how it'll all unfold as players explore vast expanses of autumnal forests, crystalline lakes, and looming mountains in snow, ice, and driving rain.
</p>
<p>
Go Wayback! is the first of three standalone games that'll serve as "building blocks" for the studio's ultimate project, Artemis - "a massive multiplayer sandbox experience that leverages the technological advancements tested" across earlier games. "After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years," Greene explained previously, "each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product."

As Steven Petite says in our Metroid Prime Remastered review, "It's an experience that has aged like fine wine, and is every bit as intoxicating now as it was 20 years ago."</p><p dir="ltr">This Metroid Prime Remastered deal is a great entry point for new players, but those who already own the game have more Metroid Prime releases to look forward to this year. Obviously, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is the big one, but there's also the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330273?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</a> artbook that launches June 24. The hardcover book will include illustrations and concept art from the original Metroid Prime trilogy and the recent Metroid Prime Remastered, along with commentary from Kensuke Tanabe and members of Retro Studios' development team. Preorders are available at Amazon.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Nintendo also has an official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-2026-Wall-Calendar-Nintendo/dp/1419783483?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 2026 wall calendar</a> up for preorder. Despite being a 2026 calendar, it also includes a 2025 planner section, so you won't have to wait until next year to use it.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">While 2025 is shaping up to be a banner year for Metroid Prime, the entire series has been enjoying some well-earned attention over the last few years. The latest game in the mainline side-scrolling series, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-Dread-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097B1149G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metroid Dread</a>, was the first all-new entry in over 19 years when it launched on Switch in 2021. If you haven't played it yet, you can grab it for $51 at Amazon. You can couple it with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Metroid-Dread-amiibo-2-Pack-Switch/dp/B0979ZHC5B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metroid Dread Amiibo 2-Pack</a>, which includes figures of Samus Aran and the E.M.M.I. robot, for $24 (was $30).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MercurySteam has revealed the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mercurysteams-new-dark-fantasy-arpg-blades-of-fire-to-be-unveiled-this-thursday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Blades of Fire game. From its looks, it will be a single player action/adventure in the vein of Sony Santa Monica's God of War titles. The protagonist is one Aran de Lira, the firstborn of the King's Ward. In this fantasy world, the newly crowned Queen Nerea has cast a spell that turns steel to stone. Only her army of abominations wields the divine metal against which other blades shatter.</p>
<p>As Aran, players must find forging scrolls, develop the main character's blacksmithing skills, and craft weapons to suit their favorite fighting style. The chosen weapon family and the materials used while forging it will affect characteristics such as weight, length, durability, penetration, and edge quality.</p>
<p>There are seven different weapon families in Blades of Fire, as well as over thirty unique Forge Scrolls, allowing for a great number of combinations. Picking the right weapon for the job, depending on the enemy's armor, will be critical. The developers promise a unique and challenging combat system that allows players to target specific parts of the enemy's body.</p>
<p>On his journey to liberate the land, Aran won't be alone. His companion, Adso, will be crucial to your adventure as he speaks the ancient language of the Forgers. He'll also provide helpful tips on how to defeat enemies by analyzing them and making notes in his chronicles. It sounds like players will need the info since Blades of Fire features over fifty enemy types, including the Queen's guards, creatures, undead, and more. Each enemy has its own unique attack style, weapon and armor. Throughout the story, Aran and Adso will explore epic environments, including huge castles and labyrinthine palaces.</p>
<p>505 Games president Neil Ralley said:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s pedigree for creating unique and beloved games is just one of the many reasons we’re thrilled to partner with them on Blades of Fire. Their gaming system that transforms weapons customization into an outstanding combat experience is astounding, as is their commitment to telling the best story possible. We can’t wait to share it with the world.</em></p>
<p>The good news is that the game isn't far off at all. It's set to launch on May 22 for PC (via the Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game's pricing is technically $59.99, though there is a 10% pre-order discount. Additionally, pre-order customers will get two in-game armors for Aran as well as additional forging materials.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest is live</a> from now until March 3rd, celebrating upcoming games with dozens of playable demos. For many games with big aspirations, getting a demo into the hands of future players is crucial during Next Fest, and some are having greater success than others. </p>



<p>Here are the demos that are attracting the most players during Steam Next Fest for February 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-played-demos-at-steam-next-fest-february-2025">Most Played Demos at Steam Next Fest (February 2025)</h2>



<p>Player numbers are all current as of February 27th.</p>



<h3 id="h-mecha-break">Mecha BREAK</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>With 317,522 players at its peak, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mecha BREAK demo</a> is greatly outpacing the other demos available during this Next Fest. The third-person multiplayer mecha shooter has become very popular with the international audience, though critical reactions have been mixed. Many players enjoy the mix of games modes and the numerous customization options, but the demo still fields a Mostly Negative review on Steam, which is attributed primarily to the game’s monetization and server issues. Insider Gaming was invited to the NA offices of developer Amazing Seasun Games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-interview-mecha-break-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to talk to Mecha BREAK’s creator about the game’s development</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-fellowship">Fellowship</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/">Fellowship</a>, which has peaked at 16,721 players, is billed as a game for players that want to jump right into end-game dungeon content like you’d see in World of Warcraft. The game features “endlessly scaling dungeon runs,” and end-game WoW fans will feel right at home with the game’s user interface and group finder mechanic. Groups will need to kill packs of enemies to unlock the boss fight, which will feature unique mechanics and challenges that a team will need to overcome.</p>



<h3 id="h-among-us-3d">Among Us 3D</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us 3D</a>, which has peaked at 6,729 players, is exactly what you think it is if you’ve ever seen Among Us before. 3D uses the same first-person perspective as Among Us VR, but without the need of a VR headset. Among Us 3D features built-in proximity chat, meaning you won’t need to use other programs to manually activate it. There will also be some new and returning mini-game tasks. The game will launch with the Skeld II and Polus Point maps from Among Us VR.</p>



<h3 id="h-roadcraft">RoadCraft</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3456580/RoadCraft_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RoadCraft</a>, which peaked at 12,559 players, is developed by the same Saber Interactive who made Snowunner and Mudrunner. But rather than operating a vehicle offroad, RoadCraft tasks you with rebuilding and reconstructing areas that have been ravaged by natural disasters. In RoadCraft, players will be able to unlock over 40 vehicles to help them replace roads, bridges, and other critical pieces of infrastructure.</p>



<p>While these demos may be the most popular, there are still dozens, it not hundreds of playable demos you should try during this Next Fest. And don’t fret, because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-2025-steam-sales-schedule-revealed-by-valve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Next Fest is coming in October</a>.</p>



<p>Which Steam Next Fest demo are you putting the most hours into? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Some 35 years after experiencing an overwhelming sense of mild disappointment thanks to Ocean Software's Terminator 2: Judgment Day on the ZX Spectrum 128K, I get to tell you a new video game adaptation of James Cameron's movie hit is coming this September. But despite the furious march of technology, this one's also going to be 2D.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate is the work of developer Bitmap Bureau - the studio behind the likes of Xeno Crisis and 88 Heroes - and it's looking to deliver some good old-fashioned arcade-style side-scrolling action inspired by "iconic scenes from Terminator 2" and "original scenarios".
</p>
<p>
Its obvious selling point is its rather strikingly animated pixel art, but - as per Terminator 2D's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw">announcement trailer</a> - it's also got a bit where you get to wander around a bar as the T-800, smashing up baddies while unabashedly in the nude. As it happens though, the T-800 (nude or otherwise) is just one of several characters you can play as in Terminator 2D.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>
<figcaption>Terminator 2D: No Fate announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkMFYMG3QLw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Bitmap Bureau say the T-800 has been designed to emphasise his weight and power, with moves including a devastating shoulder barge. And while he's slower than Terminator 2D's other playable characters - Sarah Conner and John Connor - he also has high durability. As for Sarah, she's agile and reactive, excelling at melee combat with a sliding attack. However, she can also deploy her laser sight, locking her in place but significantly boosting damage.
</p>

<p>
John Connor, meanwhile, will be playable as an adult during the game's Future War missions. He's not as agile as Sarah, but can evade attacks with a tactical roll, and also emphasises mid-to-long-range combat, with a plasma rifle, pipe bombs, and three ammo types. And, of course, the iconic T-1000 is back as the game's main adversary - liquid metal abilities included.
</p>
<p>
Terminator 2D: No Fate - which also includes multiple endings, leaving players to decide humanity's future - launches for PlayStation 5, Playstation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via Steam and Epic) on 5th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-ai-disclosure-algorithm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and the hopefully-washed masses are once again partaking of more demos than any one person can reasonably get through. This time around, though, there’s been a recurring theme to people’s hours spent sifting diamonds from the rough: AI art.&nbsp;</p><p>Across sites like Twitter and Bluesky, numerous Steam users have turned up their noses at unpleasant surprises populating their Next Fest feeds.</p><p>"Looking at the Steam Next Fest page, it's so tiresome how many games with AI art there are," The CRPG Book editor Felipe Pepe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3lixnwg5v4k2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "And it's always the same crap: generic anime girl, grimdark fantasy guy with those 'Balenciaga AI' faces, or obviously fake pixel art."</p><p>"This Steam Next Fest has probably been the most AI infested ever, and it’s all been voice acting and art more than anything," a modder who goes by the handle Manny Calavera <a href="https://x.com/MannyCalavera12/status/1894395629377655087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Twitter. "It's rough."</p><p>This week, Valve also added a mandatory AI disclosure feature to game’s Steam pages, which made headlines when it forced Activision to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally admit</a> something that players have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long suspected</a>: AI cosmetics are becoming an increasingly prolific part of the world’s most popular first-person shooter. A quick perusal of Steam Next Fest’s “Simulation” section, especially, yields many similar disclosures from games with titles like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533100/Wrap_House_Simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wrap House Simulator</em></a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544050/Gun_Factory_Simulator_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gun Factory Simulator</em></a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371650/Car_Mechanic_Workshop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Car Mechanic Workshop</em></a>. Other games sport art that looks <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3458190/Pocket_Garden_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspiciously similar</a> to something generative AI would spit out, but they lack disclosures.&nbsp;</p><p>While it’s difficult to say for certain whether or not the latest Next Fest is more awash with slop than its predecessors, it wouldn’t be surprising considering the <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developers-still-aren-t-warming-up-to-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing use of AI</a> in game development circles – even if nobody is actually asking for this. But there’s also an under-discussed factor at play: Valve changed how Steam Next Fest functions late last year.</p><p>"If people think they are seeing smaller or weirder games in this Next Fest – and the one at the end of last year – Steam did switch to this different approach where they cut out the livestreaming elements of Next Fest [and] are showing you a more random selection of games for the first two-to-three days of the Fest,” Simon Carless, founder of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameDiscoverCo</a>, an agency that analyzes how players find video games, told Aftermath. “They will then show you personalized picks, based on what everyone else has been playing, later in the Fest."</p><p>It is unlikely, however, that Valve’s goal was to surface slapdash trash.</p><p>"This does lead to some odder, tinier games getting randomly surfaced,” said Carless. “But that's Steam deliberately trying to diversify and get more 'egalitarian,' as opposed to just showing the biggest trending games, which is something that was increasingly being gamed by studios launching a demo early and pushing it to influencers to get on top of the Next Fest charts for the first day."</p><p>In my experience, Carless' assessment appears correct. Several days into Next Fest, I'm now seeing far fewer suspicious recommendations, even in oft-criticized categories like "Simulation." Intriguing prospects like <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3482840/Wanderstop_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderstop</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promise Mascot Agency</a></em>, as well as meme-y but undeniably amusing concepts like <em>Silent Hill</em> soccer game <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3495990/FEAR_FA_98/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FEAR FA 98</a></em>, have risen to the top. Only once I scroll down do I begin to see dicier fare.</p><p>These days, Valve applies this general philosophy to most corners of Steam, explained Chris Zukowski, a video game marketer who <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly writes about Steam and discoverability</a>.</p><p>"Overall, this 'Give every game 15 minutes of fame and see who survives' [approach] is a fundamental aspect to the Steam algorithm in several different areas,” Zukowski told Aftermath, pointing to a survey of Steam’s Discovery Queue he ran across 75 games of different sizes.</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Zukowski</figcaption></figure><p>"Notice how Diamond, Gold, and Silver earners all start out with around 25,000 impressions on day one and two? That is the Steam algorithm testing the games. If a lot of people buy the game on day one and two, on the subsequent days, it is given even more visibility. If it doesn't do well, its visibility is cut,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Zukowski then pointed to the brown line on the graph.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those are games that had so few wishlists going into launch that Valve figures that the dev was too unsophisticated or just a shovelware scammer,” he said. “So they don't even give them the default 25,000 views on day one and two. This Discovery Queue algorithm is why I am not worried about an AI shovelware flood. If a scammer could churn out an AI-generated game per day, they would not have had enough time or spent enough effort gathering the minimum number of wishlists to qualify for the ‘15 minutes of fame’ at launch.”&nbsp;</p><p>For years, Steam users and developers raged against <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/asset-flip-simulator-highlights-a-huge-problem-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glut of "asset flips" and fake games</a> overrunning the platform. This was Valve's solution: to algorithmically create what are functionally two Steams – the one regular people see and the landfill. While games occasionally slip through the cracks in both directions, it's a relatively effective system overall, according to developers I've spoken to over the past couple years. But it does not solve the problem of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mhwilliams.bsky.social/post/3lj4eyb6txs2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 20,000 games releasing on Steam per year</a>; it only mitigates some of them.</p><p>Those who analyze Steam and similar platforms for a living aren’t sounding the alarm bells about an AI slop flood just yet. The bigger issue Steam developers face is the sheer number of high-effort, <em>good </em>games that come out on a daily basis. This is true of Next Fest as well. There are over 1,000 games in Steam's latest demo-palooza, and many of them look solid. Can an algorithm, no matter how much time Valve spends optimizing it to ultimately lure money out of your wallet, solve that problem? Should it?</p><p>For better or worse, the algorithm remains key, and Carless and Zukowski recommend keeping a close eye on it.</p><p>"The net result of [Valve changing its approach to the previous Steam Next Fest] was I think every game got less visibility. Even top-performing AA games got fewer wishlists during SNF. So it was less winner-take-all,” said Zukowski. “There is weird stuff on Steam, but most of it is filtered out by the algorithms.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What isn’t awesome and is in fact shitty, dumb, and greedy is that Xbox is going to charge PS5 players $100 to play the game a few days early, despite <em>Horizon 5 </em>being a game that released back in 2021. </p><p>On February 27, Xbox announced that<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>would launch on PS5 on April 29.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But if you spend $100</a></span> to buy the fanciest, expensive-st version— the Premium Edition—you can start playing the game on April 25. Xbox claims this is “early access,” but uh, I’ve been playing <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>on my Xbox Series X for years now. </p><p>This is all really silly for a few reasons. First, it lays bare the fact that the early access scams publishers have embraced recently are completely arbitrary and nonsensical. A game that you can play right now on PC and Xbox is going to be released “early” for some players on PS5. Give me a break. Second, when Xbox launched <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> back in 2021 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/4402249796243-Forza-Horizon-5-Announce-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it did charge $100 for early access</a></span>, which was still annoying but at least it wasn’t already out on multiple other platforms. Now, in 2025, it seems very strange to suggest that early access is just as valuable or useful. </p><p>Yes, I know that a lot of people who only own a PS5 might be really excited to play<em> Forza Horizon 5</em> and they might be willing to shell out extra money to get their hands on the game sooner. But you don’t even need an Xbox or PC to play <em>Forza Horizon 5.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/forza-horizon-5-standard-edition/9NKX70BBCDRN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can stream <em>Horizon 5</em> via Game Pass Ultimate on your phone or tablet instantly</a></span> and that will cost you a lot less than $100. </p><p>Ultimately, I’m probably wasting my time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w"> I’ve already written about how greedy and shitty early-access pre-order bonuses are </a></span>and how publishers are just delaying games for most people to squeeze out extra pennies from a few diehard fans who have no patience or self control. </p><p>And yet, despite me and many others pointing this out, a lot of people keep spending extra money to play games a few days early. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675?_gl=1*1i6zn7a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDY4MTkwMy4xNi4xLjE3NDA2ODI4NjkuMjcuMC4w">As a result, publishers keep pushing their luck</a></span>—adding more days, charging more money, or even offering multiple release dates depending on how much extra you pay.

The future sucks.</p><p>  <strong><em>Correction: 2/27/2025, 4:05 p.m. ET</em></strong><em>: A prior version of this article incorrectly claimed Forza Horizon 5 didn’t offer an early access launch option on Xbox in 2021.</em></p><p> . <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"If we continue focusing on our mission, Pokemon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary," he said. "But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pokemon will go downhill."</p><p>The Pokemon Company is privately held, but it regularly works with its minority investor Nintendo on all manner of projects in the gaming space, including the upcoming Switch game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>. The two companies also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">teamed up recently to sue Palworld developer Pocketpair.</a></p><p>Ishihara said The Pokemon Company's strength is its sole focus on Pokemon. Whereas big-time publicly traded companies have shareholders to answer to and have businesses that stretch across numerous different brands, The Pokemon Company is, as its name states, a company all about Pokemon.</p><p>"Pokemon is the only thing we do at the Pokemon Company," Ishihara said. "So whatever profit we make from Pokemon gets reinvested in Pokemon."</p><p>He went on to say that he's happy to not have public shareholders to answer to, because if he did, people might ask why the company doesn't make non-Pokemon projects. If someone were to ask him that, Ishihara said he would reply, "'We'll go bust when Pokemon is no longer popular.'"</p><p>The Pokemon Company made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/" data-ref-id="2900-6286">a number of announcements during the Pokemon Presents event</a>, including the reveal of a brand-new game: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529754/" data-ref-id="1100-6529754">Pokemon Champions. </a></p><p>Pokemon Day, February 27, is the celebration of the debut of Pokemon Red/Green in Japan on February 27, 1996. As such, 2026 will mark the 30th anniversary of the Pokemon series.</p>
