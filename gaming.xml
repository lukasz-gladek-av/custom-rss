                <p>Entertainment giant Disney is hiring someone to join its Digital Entertainment team to work on an upcoming Star Wars game that has the ambitious goal of being a "groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/associate-art-director-franchise-creative/391/88321654624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">job ad for an Associate Art Director</a> calls for someone who will work on the "ambitious and exciting new project."</p><p>"Working with top-class industry talent, this role is perfect for the seasoned visionary leader looking to create something epic--guiding and collaborating with a robust group of creative and production leaders focused around a wonderfully rich and cohesive product that is truly Disney," reads a line from the description.</p><p>The successful candidate will be the person who "inspires and informs our development teams to deliver the most authentic world-class Star Wars experiences."</p><p>This person will help "shape the overall visual direction, safeguard IP integrity, and foster creative collaboration across internal and external teams."</p><p>The person who gets the should will review art and visual design submissions with the aim of "ensuring all assets meet our brand and quality standards." The person will also give feedback and should have a "deep understanding of Star Wars lore."</p><p>Naturally, this person will also collaborate with the teams at Lucasfilm.</p><p>The job calls for someone with a lot of experience, including a minimum of seven years in gaming, film, or TV, and someone who has a "broad and deep" understanding of Star Wars. The person should also have "extensive game development experience" on "top-grossing, critically acclaimed AAA games on console and mobile."</p><p>What's more, the person who gets the job will be asked to travel globally to meet with partners spanning the world over.</p><p>The job requisition has lots of details about what the person will do and what credentials they should have, but it does not say much of anything about what the game actually is. From the sound of the job ad, the project will be developed externally, which makes sense given Disney doesn't do much internal game development and instead licenses its brands to external teams.</p><p>While this specific game remains a mystery, we do know about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">many in-development Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse, a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, a new game from Amy Hennig, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a third Star Wars Jedi game at Respawn. The latest rumor is that Creative Assembly is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-truly-special-new-total-war-game-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6536723/" data-ref-id="1100-6536723">making a Star Wars Total War game and that it may be revealed at The Game Awards.</a></p><p>The frontrunner to become the next Disney CEO, Josh D'Amaro, is a big fan of video games. He shepared the $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for the upcoming Disney x Fortnite project, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-possible-new-ceo-wants-to-do-more-with-gaming-report/1100-6536640/" data-ref-id="1100-6536640">wants to do more with gaming going forward.</a></p><p>Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity "toys-to-life" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bob-iger-disney-isnt-particularly-good-at-publishing-games-1183088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles</a> making and publishing games internally, admitting, "We haven't been particularly good..."</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-eyepatch-wolf-fake-video-games/</link>
            <guid>1374853</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>There’s a whole world of video games out there that even people who regularly read this very site have never heard of. The only issue? They’re not real – at least in the sense that you cannot plug in a controller and play them. But that doesn’t make them any less worthwhile and, in many ways, serves as a strength. On the latest <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, YouTuber extraordinaire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGoikgbxP4F3rgI9PldI9g?ref=aftermath.site"><u>John “Eyepatch Wolf” Walsh</u></a> tells us why he’s become obsessed with fake video games.</p><p>Walsh recently released a book called <a href="https://hollow-press.net/products/the-bizarre-world-of-fake-video-games-by-super-eyepatch-wolf-u-d-w-f-g-essays-i?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Bizarre World Of Fake Video Games</u></em></a>, which is about exactly what it says: meticulously crafted settings and rule sets for games that don’t actually exist. Walsh explains his fixation with fake games and how, as he sees it, they broaden the landscape of who can imagine and create games in the first place. He also gives us a history lesson about proto-fake games like the almost unnervingly strange <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>. Then we discuss more modern, regrettably AI-driven fake game trends like <em>Bird Game 3</em>, which has become <a href="https://www.polygon.com/play-bird-game-3-real-development-indie-ai-generated-unreal-5/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a bonafide TikTok sensation</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to the week’s biggest video game news: <em>Horses</em>, an otherwise off-the-beaten-path art game from a small indie studio, got <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>banned on Steam</u></a> for reasons that remain unclear, causing a series of cascading impacts on other stores like <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-santa-ragione-delisted-relisted-epic-steam/"><u>Humble</u></a>. What does it mean for a single storefront to essentially have sole say over what and what does not constitute acceptable art? And why is everyone losing their minds over a game that, according to Chris, is <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-indie-game-banned-steam-epic-review-impressions-santa-ragione/"><u>actually pretty tame</u></a>? Lastly, we share our wild animal horror stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make an art game so messed up that it’ll get banned from Earth.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> We, on our podcast and site, talk about real games all the time. What makes a fake game compelling? What is it about them that made you say “I’ve gotta write a book about this, I’m gonna do multiple videos about this, this is gonna be my obsession, this is gonna be my whole personality”?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Part of it is that people do go overboard talking about how video games are the most experiential medium. There’s so many different ways something can be experiential. A delicious plate of food can be experiential.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That’s the most experiential thing: eating food, right?</p><p><strong>John:</strong> But what games let you do is inhabit a fictional space. That’s fucking cool. And that’s why horror games are so distinct and interesting; they engage you in a way that a noninteractive medium can’t. I think what’s interesting about fake video games is the frameworks they build to make you feel like you are nearly interacting with the world.&nbsp;</p><p>So one of the games is this thing called <em>Bramble</em>. Imagine a <em>Dark Souls</em> game, but instead of fighting the different creatures you’re encountering, what you’re doing is building these little Amalgamoids, which are like fucked up little Pokemon, and they are fighting for you. It goes so in on the menus you create these little creatures with, how each specific one of them works and the rule sets they operate under, and the situations you can use them in – to the point that it’s very easy to imagine problem solving with these mechanics.&nbsp;</p><p>And then <em>Godhusk</em>, which is the follow up to <em>Vermis</em>, goes even harder on that. There’s this entire system about how you equip limbs and what different limb sets do to your body and help you navigate the world – in a way that would take so long to explain. You’ve just gotta read it. It’s incredible.&nbsp;</p><p>So that’s all kinda stuff video games can do. I think what’s interesting about fake video games – and why I always push back on this idea of, when I show people fake games, they’ll be like “I wish this was real” – is to me, this is more interesting because it’s not real. Because it’s collaborative. I think it’s Shigesato Itoi, the <em>Earthbound </em>guy, who was like “Video games are a collaboration between the player and the designer.” Because ultimately games happen in your head. Your console produces light, sound, and signal, but you’re the one who applies meaning to it. I feel like that is the same thing that happens with fake games.&nbsp;</p><p>But on top of that as well – and I say this with all the love and respect to anyone who has ever worked on a video game – fake games don’t have to go through the nightmare grinder of game development. Which means a different kind of person is able to create them. And so, not that there isn’t an infinite of interesting and weird indie games, but [fake games] let someone show you what they would do in a video game in a way that is so broad and strange and really, really out there – in a way that would be so much more difficult if these same people had to think about not even game design and light shaders and gameplay loops, but logistics like “How do you financially create a video game? How do you raise the money to make a video game and live on it?” And so, all of the sudden, the concept of a video game becomes something that so many more people can mess with.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-xbox-pc-march-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>REPLACED, the 2.5D pixel-art-based cyberpunk platformer that was first showcased at E3 2021 and was arguably one of the most exciting prospective Xbox exclusives at the time of its reveal, finally has a release date, and will arrive on PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, and on Xbox Series X/S this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement follows developer Sad Cat Studios' announcement in August 2025 that it could confirm, "<em>with confidence</em>," <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-release-date-spring-2026-cyberpunk-platformer/">that REPLACED would be out by Spring 2026</a>. That confidence has clearly not waned, and we now have a release date for a game that, by the looks of its release date trailer, hasn't lost any of the special quality players saw in that 2021 reveal.</p>



<p>The new trailer is the best look at the game we've gotten in the years since its initial announcement, and backed by an original song from the game's soundtrack titled "<em>Dusk</em>," it appears to be firing on all cylinders ahead of its March release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuUo7_VaboE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As to why Sad Cat Studios took as long as it did to get to this point, it wasn't because Sad Cat Studios was toiling away, working on the game non-stop and burning time. Development was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">interrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>, pushing it to the point we're at now, where a game that would have otherwise come out somewhere between 2021 and 2023 is out in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>We know that our community is incredibly excited to play REPLACED and it's no secret that it's taken longer than we initially thought to deliver that to you all - we apologize for that,</em>" said game director Yura Zhdanovich in a press release back in August when the studio announced the release window. "<em>We've always tried to do what's right for the project,</em> <em>which in turn means delivering to you a truly special experience."</em></p>



<p>We'll see what Sad Cat Studios has for players when REPLACED launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S on March 12, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary industry veteran and <em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has announced that he's made a return to Obsidian Entertainment, and it's the real deal; he's no contractor, but rather a "full-time employee".</p><p>In a video posted on his YouTube channel today, Cain explained that he's returned to the <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>Grounded </em>studio "in person" rather than remotely, and that this means he's no longer "working in other places", although there's at least one project on which Cain worked apart from Obsidian that has yet to be released.</p><p>Cain says that the period between 2020 and 2025 was "a weird time in the industry", and as such, there are games on which he's worked that he isn't sure will see the light of day, too. How tantalizing!</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Fallout </em>creator Tim Cain has returned to Obsidian Entertainment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Cain also says he can't elaborate on the project on which he's currently working at Obsidian, but that "you're not gonna guess right" if you try to guess what it is, so it sounds like a novel idea, whatever it might be.</p><p>He also says he's "a lot less retired now than [he] was before", so his previous state of "semi-retirement" is no longer applicable. Additionally, Cain's YouTube channel will remain operational, since "no-one at Obsidian has even remotely suggested that [he has] to stop it".</p><p>Tim Cain first joined Obsidian in 2011, going on to work on the studio's successfully Kickstarted RPG <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, as well as serving as one of the directors for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2019's <em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>.

<p>It remains to be seen exactly what Tim Cain will do with Obsidian now he's back with the company; let's hope that Microsoft sees sense and opts to give the studio another chance at a <em>Fallout </em>game. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1374790</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After indie narrative horror game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store"><em>Horses</em></a> was banned from Steam two years ago, it put the studio, Santa Ragione, at risk of closure. Studio cofounder and <em>Horses </em>producer Pietro Righi Riva had to make a difficult phone call to the game’s director, Italian filmmaker Andrea Lucco Borlera. “I was terrified for him,” Riva said in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “This was his first game and he put so much work, so much passion, so many years, and it was supposed to be his big breakthrough.”</p><div><p>But <em>Horses</em> has broken through even without Steam. Riva’s <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html">detailed accounting of the game’s multiple storefront bans</a> caught the attention of journalists, developers, and curious gamers eager to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/05/horror-game-horses-has-been-banned-from-sale-but-is-it-as-controversial-as-youd-think">just what was so objectionable</a> that the game couldn’t be sold on Steam alongside the likes of <em>Sex Standing</em> or <em>Sex with Hitler 2</em>. That attention has made <em>Horses</em> the video game cause célèbre of the moment, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3m73jkbnhxk2i">catapulting it to bestseller status on GOG.com</a>.</p></div><p>But while this all sounds like a happy ending, Riva isn’t ready to breathe easy just yet. “I’m relieved because with all this attention, I’m probably going to be able to give back most of the money [roughly half of $100,000] that I had to borrow,” he said. “But we’re not out of the [woods] yet, no.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: Santa Ragione Game Studio</cite></p></div><p><em>Horses</em> is a short, crunchy-looking game, boasting Dreamcast-era graphics with gameplay that’s no more involved than clicking things to put them in and take them out of your inventory. And while Santa Ragione has had success with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/saturnalia-review/"><em>Saturnalia</em></a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-review-an-artfully-told-oppressively-bleak-story"><em>Milky Way Prince</em></a> before the bans, it was largely a little-known developer. Riva is aware of how that looks, acknowledging that the bans have been instrumental in <em>Horses</em> punching through the noise.</p><p>“There is no way the same kind of interest would have happened,” he said. And despite that first difficult call, Riva says Borlera is quite pleased at what the bans have done for his game. “He’s extremely happy with the reception that the game is getting,” Riva said. “People are reading into the game and [...] engaging with it in a way that he hoped.”</p><div><p>“There is no way the same kind of interest would have happened.”</p></div><p>That engagement, though, isn’t enough to make up for the access Steam could have provided. While Riva is grateful for the support of gamers and storefronts like GOG, it’s not enough, and he’s still very much in fear of Santa Ragione’s future. “Even with all the publicity, all the reporting, all the reviews, everything else,” he said. “This still does not compare to the kind of audience we would have on Steam.”</p><p>Steam has an outsize influence on the PC video game market. The indie studios that cannot afford the costs of porting their games to consoles are at the mercy of Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16783394/you-must-be-18-or-older-to-enter-game-banned-porn-steam">vague</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/1/17417790/steam-pornography-rules-guidelines-porn-visual-novels">capricious</a>, and often <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/15/24297364/steam-extremist-content-moderation-us-senator-warner-letter">inconsistent</a> moderation whims. Though <em>Horses </em>has found a roundabout way to relative success without it, Riva said that journey has been traumatic, affecting not just him and his team but his peers and future projects.</p><p>“I think there is going to be, in my case, and in other people’s case, a certain degree of self-censorship,” he said. “It’s terrifying, and it’s going to make people make safer and safer games, me included.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/839164/horses-interview-santa-ragione-steam-ban-censorship]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It’s after 5pm on a Friday, but no force on this Earth can stop me hurrying back to my desk to report on a large financial transaction. Also, we should have written this up earlier, but we were busy deciding which are the objectively correct <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">100 best PC games</a>. </p>
<p>I’m not… sure we put any Warner Bros games in that list. I’ve just done a CTRL-F for “Batman” and got zero results. I know, WTF - Arkham Asylum is amazing. Mark needs to stop driving things and think about capes for a change. I’m sure Warner Bros aren’t too bothered about this gross oversight right now, though. Netflix have just revealed plans to buy their entertainment business for $82.7 billion in stock and cash.</p><!--more-->
<p>The deal follows an announcement in June that Warner would split in two, with one “Streaming &amp; Studios” operation including Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios and HBO, while the other, “Global Networks”, encompasses sports and TV news such as TNT and CNN. Netflix want to buy the Streaming &amp; Studios part, pending regulatory approvals in the next 12-18 months, which includes several game studios: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> creators Avalanche, Lego devs TT Games, Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm and Rocksteady of Batman Arkham fame, who also made Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. </p>
<p>As with any large corporate acquisition, it seems likely all this is going to lead to layoffs and cancellations as the acquiring company seek to recoup some of their outlay, and show the shareholders they're running a tight ship. Assuming the deal goes through, Netflix have said they hope "to realize at least $2-3 billion of cost savings per year" over three years.</p><p>Warner’s games division haven’t been doing well lately, and there have already been some major cuts. Suicide Squad was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">disaster</a>, leading to layoffs at Rocksteady this January. In February, Warner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">closed Monolith, Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego</a>. In March, Bloomberg reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion">that a Hogwarts Legacy expansion had been cancelled</a>. In May, Warner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">pulled support for comicbook Smash ‘em up MultiVersus</a><a></a> while announcing the end of major updates for NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat 1; they also revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">a 48% revenue drop for their most recent financial quarter</a>.</p>
<p>It’s naturally a bit worrisome in this context that Netflix’s press release announcing the proposed acquisition <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">doesn’t really mention games</a>, save for Squid Game and Game Of Thrones. The focus is firmly on broader “entertainment”, streaming and Warner’s various intellectual properties. Netflix already have a videogame business, of course, but they’ve experienced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">reversals of their own</a> in the past couple of years, and seem inclined to focus right now on TV and film.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>For one night in 2005, the Mojave Desert glowed green. Microsoft inexplicably launched its then-new console, the Xbox 360, with a release event in a hangar in the desert. A Microsoft executive told Gizmodo in 2005 </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/xbox-360-zero-hour-burning-man-as-interpreted-by-micro-138815"><span>that it was supposed to resemble Burning Man</span></a><span>, the art festival where Silicon Valley’s rich reenact the prelude to a </span><i><span>BioShock</span></i><span> game.. Another executive called it an “</span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-360-launch-event-zero-hour-photos"><span>Xbox 360 oasis</span><span>.</span></a><span>” Journalists and Xbox fans—it was both a press event and a player launch party—lounged on beanbags to play the hottest new console at one of dozens of stations. Microsoft served alcohol from paneled domes that are now synonymous with </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/31/950178368/yurts-igloos-and-pop-up-domes-how-safe-is-outside-restaurant-dining-this-winter"><span>covid-era outdoor dining</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>These sorts of big budget gaming events, where companies spared no expense on luring press and fans into weird places—all in the name of promoting new hardware or games—don’t exist much anymore. But 20 years later, an artifact channeling that bygone era has reemerged, once again, this time in the Colorado desert: a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-desert-statue-tga-diablo-4-2000649133"><span>mysterious demonic statue</span></a><span> with the bodies of the damned etched into its sides.</span></p>

 <h2>The Game Awards’ portal to hell</h2> <p><span>The Game Awards overseer Geoff Keighley posted a photo of the mysterious statue with a </span><a href="https://what3words.com/regal.inspiring.thickness"><span>geocode pointing people to an area of Joshua Tree National Park</span></a><span>, just off of Yucca Mesa Road. Tendrils glow red from the statue at night, illuminating the screaming skeletons of both humans and creatures. Several people who’ve visited the statue have posted about it on social media and Reddit. Apparently, a security guard watches over the relic—”cool dude,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pcvnhp/so_i_got_to_visit_the_statue/"><span>according to Reddit user TautSexyElfKing</span></a><span>—and the statue makes sounds. Another person instructed others to knock on the door, saying something else will knock back.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was very ambient and hellish sounding,” TautSexyElfKing said. “Almost like it was a doorway and on the other side was a large cavern with demons lurking about the other side. Maybe some light growling-ish sounds. There wasn’t anything I could make out in particular that would be a hint or anything”</span></p>

 <p><span>To the unaware, it looks like the kind of thing you might find at Burning Man, or maybe an altar for worshipping the devil. But Keighley’s post is a signal to gamers that this is an Easter egg—a marketing stunt. It’s working, not because it’s hyping people up for any specific game or console, but because it’s pushing people toward Keighley’s pride and joy: an end of year bash produced, owned, and hosted by the man himself.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statue itself is ambiguous enough that spectators can map it onto whatever’s at the top of their Game Awards World Premier wishlist. It’s off Yucca Mesa Road, so it must be for </span><i><span>Half-Life 3</span></i><span>. The demonic symbols are an obvious reference to </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span>‘s next expansion. No, wait—</span><a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder/status/1994865924206452744"><span>maybe that’s </span><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span>. It’s essentially a hell portal, which clearly means </span><i><span>Doom</span></i><span>. I don’t know, maybe </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>? Or, perhaps, </span><a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556"><span>Keighley is simply himself opening a portal to hell</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pdt9n9/what_if_its_not_teasing_a_game_at_all_and_geoff/"><span>intends to destroy the whole dang world</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no one is considering that Geoff is simply opening a hell portal <a href="https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6">https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Apparently everyone is wrong, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1pcf4dp/jason_schreier_says_that_the_game_awards_statue/"><span>according to</span><i><span> Bloomberg</span></i><span> reporter Jason Schreier</span></a><span>, who said it’s not </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>. “</span><span>I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one,” he wrote </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-7#post-148323163"><span>on a gaming forum</span></a><span>. </span><span>” Regardless of the answer, The Game Awards wins—the statue has gotten enough buzz that people will, certainly, tune in to see what the statue is teasing.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a little more easily digestible than, say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-two-year-mystery-is-over-this-is-frog-fractions-2-1790505179"><span>the </span><i><span>Frog Fractions 2</span></i><span> ARG</span></a><span> that went unsolved for literally two years spanning nearly two dozen games on Steam and a book in a California library. Then there’s the </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> ARG called I Love Bees, which spanned three months, jars of honey, and several pay phones,&nbsp; or when Electronic Arts launched copies of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>into space using weather balloons. (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/early-mass-effect-3-winners-may-have-jumped-into-legal-5888619"><span>The people who found the copies</span></a><span>, inevitably plummeting back to earth, could play the game early.)</span></p> <p><span>Keighley’s Game Awards statue doesn’t seem to necessarily be an alternate reality game. It’s hard to say if it’s really leaving any clues for gamers to decode or just there to power the hype cycle. It feels more aligned with the chaotic churn of algorithmic virality that everyone’s seeking these days—a weird thing in a weird place, easily photographed or videotaped and circulated on TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere. </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=game%20awards%20statue&amp;t=1764954890852"><span>It’s working</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The new AAA realty</h2> <p><span>Companies have done these sorts of things for highly-anticipated, big budget games like </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2GpQl"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>(big action figures in big boxes), </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/10p0i4x/giant_leviathan_axe_appeared_in_london/"><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span> (big axe in London), and </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/life-size-horizon-forbidden-west-clawstrider-statues-could-win-you-a-ps5"><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></a><span> (big mechanical monsters). The difference, of course, is that it’s obvious what these installations were promoting. The danger in the Game Awards statue is that people will end up let down by whatever game it’s tied to.</span></p>

 <p><span>Events like The Game Awards were born to market AAA games; Keighley fills the show with commercials for the latest and greatest big-budget blockbusters from the industry’s mega-companies, backed by a booming voice boasting a world premiere announcement or new gameplay trailer. The biggest of these, games like </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Marvel’s Wolverine</span></i><span>, barely need the extra eye-balls while everything else gets lost in the shuffle. Homegrown debut hits like </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Expedition 33: Clair Obscure</span></i><span>, meanwhile, come out of nowhere and dominate the zeitgeist without the help of giant marketing machines. While some companies hope to manufacture a fraction of that cachet with big showcase moments, it’s no longer obvious that they’re for sale. To hear some tell it, the old AAA gaming model has reached “</span><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the"><span>the end of days</span></a><span>.” We’re a long way from cosplaying Area 51 for a midnight console launch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I suppose that’s not Keighley’s problem. People might not remember whatever the statue ends up being for but they’ll tune into The Game Award to find out. He gets to hype his show either way.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> technically isn’t the first Nintendo-published Switch 2 game to offer 120FPS support, but I don’t count that weird paid tech demo known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-worst-games-nintendo-metacritic-drag-x-drive-welcome-tour-2000617517"><em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em></a> that launched with the system. No, <em>Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s first 120FPS Switch 2 experience, and it’s amazing. It is also a bit odd coming from Nintendo, but it makes me really hope this is an option in future games from the <em>Mario</em> company.</p> <p>Out now on Switch 2 and the OG Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> is the next entry in the popular sci-fi shooter series that is itself a spin-off of the 2D <em>Metroid</em> games.<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"> And while I found the opening hour to be a bit meh</a>, the game really picks up once you reach Volt Forge. But one thing that was great and remained excellent from the very start was <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s performance mode on Switch 2, which offers up 120 buttery smooth frames per second if your TV can handle it. Gunplay, platforming, driving, and even puzzle solving are just so much nicer at the higher framerate.</p>

 <p>And this isn’t some hidden mode. No, the moment you first boot up <em>Prime 4</em>, it asks you to select between two modes: a 4K/60FPS option and a 1080p/120FPS option. I’ve played the game both ways, and while the 60FPS option is great and looks a tad sharper, I’ve primarily played Prime 4 in the 120FPS mode because it feels so nice and smooth. At first, I was worried that the Switch 2 would struggle to maintain that high framerate. But in my hours with the game so far, I’ve only seen one or two dips, and that was only in the open world desert portions of <em>Prime 4.</em></p>

  <p>It’s tricky to share 120FPS videos on the internet. Even using YouTube is challenging, as the ability to watch 120FPS content depends on the video, your device, etc. So unfortunately, I can’t show you how good <em>Prime 4</em> looks running at a high framerate. <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-is-switch-2s-first-true-120hz-3d-showcase">But trust me, it’s great and totally worth the small trade-off</a> of the image looking a little softer compared to the 4K/60FPS mode. And yeah, it’s weird to even be talking about modes like this in a Nintendo first-party release. I’m not upset about it at all, though, as I’ve long wanted Nintendo’s visuals and tech to catch up with the rest of the industry, and this is a big step in that direction.</p> <p>Now all I can do is think about how great it would be for the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> to offer a 120FPS mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-us-all-remember-the-great-f-zero-gx-5920082">Can you imagine a new <em>F-Zero</em> running at 120FPS</a>? Or what about a <em>Smash Bros</em> sequel offering a high framerate mode? I know not all Nintendo-published games moving forward will support 120FPS, but I hope we get a few more every year as the company’s games often look and feel better than usual when you have all those extra frames.</p>

This gun has infinite ammo, and it can also be Pack-a-Punched.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing the map's LGM-1 quest will only reward you with one Wonder Weapon, no matter how many people are in your party.</p><p dir="ltr">To get another LGM-1 Wonder weapon for your party, you'll need to get lucky with the randomness of the Mystery Box or use a Wonderbar GobbleGum. However, the Wonderbar GobbleGum only guarantees your next spin of the Mystery Box will be a Wonder Weapon, but it could give you the Ray Gun instead.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Activate_power_for_the_map">Activate power for the map</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616796" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616796"></a><figcaption>Pack-a-Punch machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game holds your hand for this part, so all you need to do is follow the orange quest markers that guide you through finding the missing components to repair the oculus, and then complete these guided steps to turn on the power and activate the Pack-a-Punch machine.</p><p dir="ltr">Note: During these early steps you'll find purple Aether crystals around the map. <strong>Do not shoot these yet</strong>. They don't seem to spawn frequently, and you'll need them for the step below, which also requires you to save up salvage to get the Cryo Freeze ammo mod on your gun.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Find_the_parts_for_the_Wonder_Weapon">Find the parts for the Wonder Weapon</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Absolute_Zero_fragments">Absolute Zero fragments</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616797-purplecrystal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616797" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616797-purplecrystal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616797"></a><figcaption>Purple Aether crystal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616797-purplecrystal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, you need the Cryo Freeze ammo mod on your gun. Shoot the purple Aether crystals that spawn randomly all around the map. You need to be using the gun with Cryo Freeze, and this will cause the crystals to drop an Absolute Zero fragment part.</p><p dir="ltr">Shoot three different crystals and <strong>collect the Absolute Zero fragment parts</strong> for each. You also want to <strong>avoid shooting any additional crystals</strong> on the map, as you might need more fragments if you fail a later step.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Wiring_part">Wiring part</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616798" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616798"></a><figcaption>Outdoor light blinking in my match</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You also need to collect wires. This is done by shooting a blinking outdoor light, and an example of one is shown in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of outdoor lights, but only one light blinking each match. The blinking is very noticeable, so just walk around the exterior of the map until you find it. Shoot the lamp, and <strong>collect the Wiring part</strong> it drops.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Battery_part">Battery part</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616799-battery.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616799" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616799-battery.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616799"></a><figcaption>Battery from Ol' Tessie</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616799-battery.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You need a Pack-a-Punched gun for this step. Go back to Ol' Tessie in the spawn area of the map and shoot the hood of the truck. <strong>Pick up the Battery part</strong> that drops out.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damaged_Drone_part">Damaged Drone part</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616800-oscardrones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616800" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616800-oscardrones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616800"></a><figcaption>Shoot Oscar's drones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616800-oscardrones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This part requires Oscar, who is the map's new robot enemy type. Oscar starts spawning into your rounds after you've unlocked Pack-a-Punch. This robot will have little flying drones hovering above and trying to protect him. Shoot and destroy one of the drones and <strong>pick up the Damaged Drone</strong> part it drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, don't waste your bullets trying to kill Oscar in this step. This is a boss you need to keep around and use for the steps below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Oscar_trap_trials">Oscar trap trials</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three trials you need to do involving traps and Oscar. Again, don't waste your ammo trying to kill Oscar, but instead, you want to lure him to one of the three trap areas on the map to complete a trial.</p><p dir="ltr">These trials are best attempted at the end of the round when you only have one or two zombies left. This keeps you from getting overwhelmed with enemies. They can also be completed in any order, but you will need to have collected all parts mentioned above. Oscar will <strong>drop the LGM-1 Wonder Weapon reward</strong> after he's defeated in the last trial you complete.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Luminarium_trap">Luminarium trap</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616801" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616801"></a><figcaption>Battery Overcharge step in Luminarium</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lure Oscar to the Observatory's Luminarium and interact with the trap inside the room to place the Battery part. Now you need to survive in the room, while keeping Oscar nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a meter that appears on your screen for a Battery Overcharge. Keep Oscar close to the trap until the meter is full. You also want to make sure you're destroying the drones that protect him, as they make him invulnerable to the traps.</p><p dir="ltr">If he's invulnerable with drones when the Overcharge meter fills, you'll fail the step and need to repeat it on the next round.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Observatory_Dome_trap">Observatory Dome trap</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616803" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616803"></a><figcaption>Steam valve</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Head to the Observatory Dome (Pack-a-Punch) room. Oscar doesn't need to be inside the room for the first part of this step, so if you have a teammate, get them to lead Oscar and zombies away while you search for a broken steam valve.</p><p dir="ltr">The valve can spawn all around the inside of the Pack-a-Punch room, and you can hear an audible hiss when you're close. Find it, shoot it, and another valve will appear. Repeat this process of shooting the steam valves until you have done this for five valves. Make sure you're looking on the lower level and the upper level above you. Once all five are successfully shot, you'll get an audio cue.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616804" data-ratio="0.56265432098765" data-width="3240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616804"></a><figcaption>Align the sun with the telescope trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, you need to bring Oscar close to the Pack-a-Punch machine before you interact with the telescope trap across from it. When you interact with the trap, it will change your view to the viewfinder of the telescope, and you're looking up at the sky. You need to adjust the telescope to align with the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of your view from the telescope is just pink and purple colors in space, but move it until you see the sun. The sun seems to be positioned the same in every match, so move the viewfinder up and to the right. You'll see a yellow glowing orb, and that's the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you line up the sun, you're kicked out of the telescope view, and Oscar should be close enough to zap with the sun beam that shoots down inside the room. Again, this is the area directly in front of Pack-a-Punch, and the beam is going to be centered in between the PaP and the trap.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Museum_Infinitum___Absolute_Zero_fragments">Museum Infinitum - Absolute Zero fragments</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616805"></a><figcaption>Rocket trap activated</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lead Oscar to the Museum Infinitum room with the rocket trap. You need to get Oscar really close to the back of the trap, and then quickly interact with the trap controls to blast Oscar with the rockets. This is a much faster process than the Luminarium step, but you also have to time it correctly, because the rockets will only blast for a few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">This can be difficult solo, but with additional teammates, you can have one person at the controls while another baits Oscar to the trap.</p><p dir="ltr">If you fail this step, then you'll need to go collect three more fragments from the purple Aether Crystals and try again.</p><p dir="ltr">Once all three trials are complete, Oscar will drop the LGM-1 Wonder Weapon for you to pick up.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow.</strong></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing.</p><p dir="ltr">Your mileage may vary on how much you care about these characters--in my review I said they're mostly broad military archetypes--but it's clear that the game <em>wants</em> you to care about them. They're functionally your crew. They all stay back at base camp and help you out in different ways. When the time comes to break into the Lamorn's shielded tower, all of you go together. Your mission to reactivate the Master Teleporter is to open a way back home. The unspoken element of this is that you're trying to save them, too. They're all stranded far from home just like you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, as you start to activate the Master Teleporter, Sylux chooses that moment to attack. A major portion of the final battle involves fighting alongside all five of the Federation squad at once, providing emergency help when they're downed, and taking down Sylux's shields so that they can all concentrate fire on him. But just when it seems he's beaten and you can all go home, he reemerges. The teleporter is damaged and can only hold out so long, and it can only work if Samus is the one operating it. Sylux is dead-set on attacking Samus to the exclusion of all the others, and if she gets hurt, the teleporter won't have an operator. So in a moment of selfless heroism, they each grab onto Sylux, stalling him just long enough, as they tell Samus to escape. At the height of the dramatic tension, you have to press A to teleport, leaving your comrades behind as they cling to Sylux to protect you.</p><p dir="ltr">That is: The five <em>Federation</em> characters act selflessly and heroically, while Samus saves herself.</p><p dir="ltr">Now to be fair, the stakes of the moment make it clear Samus has no choice. In fact, if you abstain from activating the teleporter, you simply die and need to start one phase of the boss battle over again. So Samus is not actually being selfish, but she's not exactly being heroic either. This is living legend Samus Aran--her reputation precedes her. All of these characters knew who she was and implicitly trusted her. Throughout this campaign and many others, we've seen her do the impossible. So at this moment, it's just hard to buy the dramatic conceit that she couldn't have figured out any other way than to leave her comrades behind.</p><p dir="ltr">If Prime 4's ending is intended as the starting point for a new series, it immediately raises questions about what comes next. Sylux is still out there, albeit seemingly marooned on a dying planet without any way to escape. Sylux is still in command of the Metroids, and still presumably has the loyalty of his loose assemblage of space pirates. Your five Federation companions are there with him--he either killed them immediately after you escaped, or, more optimistically, they got away and went back to base camp. Except now the Master Teleporter has no operator and they have no viable path off-planet.</p><p dir="ltr">So what happens now? Will the entire series focus on this war with Sylux? Is Samus going back to Viewros to rescue her companions? Does she even know where Viewros is, or is it just one of billions of uncharted planets in the furthest reaches of space? The brief moment that we see a starmap strongly suggests the latter. But the ending as a whole leaves us with almost no clarity as to where Samus's story might be headed after Prime 4, and gives this revival a listless quality. As a result of the lack of any propulsive force toward the next chapter, we're left lingering with this final, unflattering impression of the great Samus Aran.</p><p dir="ltr">We do see a somber and genuinely affecting moment where Samus honors her comrades. But that doesn't offer much clue as to what the future holds. For the time being, it's a downer. The triumphant return of the Metroid Prime series left us with Samus failing to protect people who were depending on her, and with a small band of new characters getting the heroic climax. Regardless of how you feel about the characters themselves, I was left feeling like Samus had been pushed out of the spotlight in her own series.</p><p dir="ltr">When you're in the final area accompanied by your companions, you can talk to them each individually before proceeding to the final battle. They all make comments aligned with their personalities. Some are funny, others are more reflective. VUE apologizes for wrecking Betsy, the massive mech that you used to punch a hole through the forcefield. Tokabi remarks that this place feels sacred. As you move your way through, the troops start to talk about finding the teleporter, and how eager they are to leave. Armstrong, the enthusiastic private who has looked up to Samus since they first met, says just one thing: "Finally, we get to go home."</p><p dir="ltr">I'm sorry Armstrong, but no we don't. Not all of us. Not yet.</p>

Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">webcam compatibility has since improved</a>, but if you don’t already own one, you can now use your Pixel smartphone, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phone-as-switch-2-webcam-3622443/">according to <em>Android Authority</em></a>.</p></div><p>Despite Nintendo’s claims that the Switch 2 works with most USB webcams, our own testing confirmed that Pixel smartphones could not be used as webcams at launch, even with the device’s settings switched to the USB webcam mode that Google introduced with Android 14. Switch 2 users eventually found that Android phones and iPhones could be used as a webcam for the console, but with the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGH_VF-Gx4Y">additional USB-C to HDMI adapters</a>, and HDMI capture cables.</p><p>But extra hardware is no longer needed to use a Pixel smartphone as a Switch 2 webcam. We tested a Pixel 9 Pro connected directly to the Switch 2’s top USB-C port with a single cable and, after switching the USB preferences to “Webcam” mode, we were able to use the smartphone as the camera for GameChat. If you’re playing multiplayer games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>, GameChat lets you not only speak with other competitors around the world, but also see them superimposed over a livestream of them playing if you’re using a webcam.</p><p>It’s not known if recent updates on Google’s or Nintendo’s end are responsible for making this work (the Pixel 9 Pro we tested it with is running the Android 16 December release), but it’s a welcome upgrade for those who frequently travel with their Switch 2 and don’t want to lug a separate webcam everywhere they go.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/839133/google-pixel-smartphone-nintendo-switch-2-webcam]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 24-page 'World Databook', to give it its official title, is full of a lot of things you would expect from a classic instruction manual, including game controls and character introductions, but there are also rundowns of the game's main locales and mechanics, with a sneaky bit of lore peppered in there, too.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of pages, so you can get a taste for what's inside:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/databook/pdf/PDFmanual.pdf">full PDF</a> has instructions for how to print and fold the booklet, so you can rest easy knowing that it'll slot nicely into those under-utilised plastic clips that occupy the top half of all modern game cases.</p>
<p>Would opening the in-game menu and looking up the controls that way be an awful lot easier? Sure it would. But come on, where's the fun in that?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat, Hogwarts Legacy, And Batman: Arkham Are Going To A Company That Closed Its Only AAA Game Studio]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918</link>
            <guid>1374697</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Netflix is bidding <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">over $80 billion to buy Warner Bros.</a>, and it’s probably not doing it for the games. But the company will still come away with a ton of them if the merger goes through. Warner Bros. Games is one of the few major publishers left in the U.S. following years of big acquisition deals. What might be closer to a rounding error relative to the larger movie and TV portfolio still marks a huge shift for the industry. And Netflix’s incredibly chaotic fumbling of gaming over the last several years raises some alarm bells.</p> <p>The king of streaming confirmed during a conference call presentation about the newly revealed deal that games would be part of the transaction, but <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-netflix-is-acquiring-warner-bros-games">never discussed them outright</a>. Instead, they were relegated to the smallest square on a presentation slide outlining the various components of the merger. They were lumped in with “Games &amp; Consumer Product &amp; Experiences” alongside much bigger brands like HBO, DC, Harry Potter, and Superman.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650991"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650991">Netflix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Even with its massive success, the best-selling game of 2023, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, was clearly nowhere close to top-of-mind for Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters. The open-world wizarding game already has a sequel in development at Avalanche Software, and it’s supposed to have <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-hbo-harry-potter-tv-release-date-1851690168">some level of crossover</a> with the upcoming HBO <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot. The first <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> sold over 30 million copies. In revenue terms at least, that puts it way ahead of the global box office for something like James Gunn’s first<em> Superman </em>movie.</p>

 <p>Then there’s TT Games, the UK-based maker of the recent hit <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>. It announced a new adaptation of <em>Batman</em> earlier this year called <em>Lego Batman: The Legacy of the Dark Knight,</em> which acts as a best-of sizzle reel for the comic book hero’s peak movie moments <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">in an<em> Arkham</em>-style open world</a>. There’s no release date yet, but it seems likely to arrive sometime in 2026. If it’s anything like the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, it’ll be another top-seller.</p>

 <p>Netflix will also become the new home of <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. While a new movie launches next year, fans have been waiting for NeatherRealms to return to the DC universe with <em>Injustice 3</em>. The studio <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810">announced earlier this year</a> that it was done shipping new DLC for 2023’s <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> and would switch to focusing on its “next project” instead. Unless Ed Boon’s team is quietly at work on a completely new cross-over fighting game, a return to the alternate DC universe where Superman is bad still seems like the safest bet.</p>

 <h2>The fate of Rocksteady Studios</h2> <p>After that, things at Warner Bros. Games start to get really messy, thanks to years of seemingly short-sighted and chaotic executive decisions. Rocksteady Studios, once the team behind premier blockbusters like <em>Batman: Arkham City</em> and<em> Batman: Arkham Knight,</em> has been licking its wounds after the dismal failure of last year’s live service spin-off,<em> Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Encouraged by publisher leadership</a> despite misgivings from the studio floor, the multiplayer loot shooter lost over $200 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">according to<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The studio is reportedly back to focusing on the Arkham franchise that made it famous, but a new entry would still be years away during a time when AAA development is more expensive and precarious than ever. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games took an ax to many of its other studios, including <em>MultiVersus</em> maker Player First Games, WB San Diego, which was making a free-to-play AAA game, and Monolith Productions, which was working on a long-in-development adaptation of <em>Wonder Woman</em>. The latter had a storied history, including developing the <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> series, but <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/103578/full-backstory-revealed-on-why-wb-games-axed-monolith-productions/index.html">lost key leadership</a> after it was forced to pivot from a new IP to adapting <em>Wonder Woman</em>.</p>

 <p>All of this turmoil resulted in publishing head David Haddad being fired from Warner Bros. Games after a decade-plus tenure. The game division’s struggles may have also been compounded by whip-lash from above, amid Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s ongoing whirlwind tour through the unraveling conglomerate. Despite casually trampling on marketing plans by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23612615/mortal-kombat-12-announced-2023-release-date/">revealing projects early</a> during investor calls, Zaslav never seemed to be interested in providing Warner Bros. Games with a clear mission or mandate other than “help make stock price go up.”</p> <h2>The Netflix Gaming debacle</h2> <p>News of the sale might be more reassuring if Netflix management didn’t seem equally at a loss when it comes to games. The streamer snatched up a bunch of small studios, including notable indie darlings like<em> Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and <em>Cozy Grove</em> maker Spry Fox over the years. It loaded up its mobile app with tons of critically-acclaimed games from<em> Hades</em> to <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>. It sought big-name additions like the<em> GTA Trilogy Remastered</em>. It even plunged ahead with an AAA studio called Team Blue that pulled veterans from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>.</p> <p>But despite bundling top games with its standard subscription service, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/23/netflix-takes-slow-approach-to-video-games.html">almost nobody played them</a>. It started abandoning indie game deals, cutting resources, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio">quietly shuttered</a> its AAA team last year. Just this week, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox">Netflix announced</a> it was selling off Spry Fox, which it bought only three years ago, though the ambitious 3D Studio-Ghibli-meets-<em>Animal-Crossing</em>-chillfest called <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will remain in development. Instead, the company’s big focus moving forward will be party games and quick-turn-around licensed junk for its biggest streaming hits like <em>Squid Games</em> and <em>Bridgerton</em>. It’s the latest example of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">tech company racing into gaming and falling flat on its face</a>.</p>

 <p>So where does that leave Warner Bros. Games and its checkered portfolio of major games and studios? It’s hard to say. In some ways, it complements all of the areas of gaming where Netflix has already failed or retreated. It may not be high up on the list of synergies, but maybe the possibility of an eventual <em>Lego Stranger Things</em> anthology is still part of the streaming platform’s overall ambitions for the merger. Or maybe gaming, and AAA blockbuster gaming in particular, is so peripheral to Netflix’s broader business that Warner Bros. Gaming will find itself in an even more precarious position.</p> <p>Giant acquisitions are rarely as neat and tidy in practice as they appear on paper or in a PowerPoint presentation, even in the best of times, let alone when they’re thrown together in the midst of bidding wars, tumultuous legacy media transformations, and a race toward industry consolidation in order to achieve monopoly pricing power. The only thing worse is the alternatives: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/i-wanna-blow-this-up-how-bari-weiss-is-trying-to-overhaul-cbs-news-7c222dcd?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf__sU79yafyMQJEMfHCSs4fmigQ3B1FDTDxd4VSdFIXnEqE9fLO4kOIFOfdrE%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693321bd&amp;gaa_sig=YVIiDhsSG8Saq0NhdsXVZfrJk7xIcIWtlf4iFEqprJZt9Q0pE5poRMAJo7dIKNvDDygD-VXenQ654oZeVxoqcQ%3D%3D">the Bari Weis network</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">Microsoft</a>, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia</a> aren’t great options either.</p>

Heavily influenced by Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics, the game has captivated fans with its meticulously crafted war story and highly strategic battles, all played out to a beautiful soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just over a year following its release, a truly major collaboration between Sword of Convallaria: For This World of Peace and CD PROJEKT RED's open-world RPG The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has been fully realised and delivered to gamers. <a href="https://youtu.be/sEGNfoSPAXg?si=7s8jqQG1yfoKBR-5" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri now appear in Sword of Convallaria as playable characters</a>; allowing players to enjoy collaborative stories and quests surrounding the Lord of the Forest from another world.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-0-35-screenshot-1764947962246.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Geralt and Yennefer in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bartosz Sztybor, Franchise Creative Director at CD PROJEKT RED, explained his take on the collaboration and how it came together:</strong> “At CD PROJEKT RED, storytelling is at the heart of everything we do, and we take a hands-on approach even when collaborating with external partners. For our partnership with Sword of Convallaria, our Franchise Creative team worked closely with developer XD International to craft a story that captures the essence of The Witcher universe, both for the anime trailer and the collaboration quest. Working with a partner who shares our passion for The Witcher is always a privilege, and we’re thrilled with the results of what we’ve created together. We’re looking forward to sharing the fruits of this partnership with the community, and can’t wait to see their response!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>CD PROJEKT RED’s Satoru Homma, Japan Country Manager, offered further insight into their partnership with XD Games:</strong> “For the collaboration between Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, I was responsible for project management on behalf of CD PROJEKT RED. I am personally a huge fan of Sword of Convallaria, and I had a strong desire to see The Witcher 3’s characters — rendered in beautiful pixel art — playable within a tactical RPG. With the deep love and understanding Sword of Convallaria’s team holds for The Witcher 3, and under the thorough supervision of our in-house lore specialists, we were able to deliver grounded and authentic storytelling in the collaboration quest. I sincerely hope that The Witcher 3 players who may be unfamiliar with the tactical RPG genre will take the time to enjoy this content, which is infused with a deep appreciation for the world and its characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director of Sword of Convallaria, Guo Lei (of XD Games)spoke about this collaboration in more detail — as well as the circumstances that led to it becoming a reality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inspired by <em>Tactics Ogre</em>, which he played in high school, Guo always wanted to become a game creator. He is also a fan of <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and his favourite characters are Geralt and Yennefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo on Sword of Convallaria passing the first anniversary of its western release and how he feels looking back on the past year:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword of Convallaria got off to a successful start, but there was a period when we were searching for the right direction to go in. However, thanks to the support of our fans, we were able to turn things around and successfully celebrate our first anniversary. From now on, we will continue to develop the game with confidence and enjoyment for the fans who have high expectations for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding the game's content, the Global version saw the release of Iria, and the story of her stepping into the world that lies beyond was depicted on the first anniversary. In the future, Sword of Convallaria will enter its 2.0 story arc, taking players on adventures beyond Iria, and develop a story in which the player protects peace. We hope you will look forward to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>— On how the  The Witcher 3 collaboration came about:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guo:</strong> From the beginning, our team had already been acquainted with the CDPR China team. During one of these casual conversations, we mentioned that it would be exciting if we could one day work on something together based on Sword of Convallaria and The Witcher 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later, we had the opportunity to meet the CDPR Japan team in person at Tokyo Game Show 2024. During our discussions there, I showed them my personal love for The Witcher 3 and the interest in exploring whether we might create something together. They encouraged us to submit a formal proposal, which set the collaboration into motion. The Witcher 3 is a game that boasts worldwide popularity, so I was over the moon when he positively considered our proposal for a collaboration. After considerable effort, the collaboration was officially approved. From that point onward, both teams dedicated nearly a full year to development, ultimately bringing this collaboration to life in the form you see today.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-12-screenshot-1764948504837.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Play as Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, and Ciri in Sword of Convallaria</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What it was about </strong><em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em><strong> that particularly appealed to him:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">First of all, it's the sense of immersion that comes with being so realistic. You get the feeling that you're immersed in the world, something you can't experience in other games. Also, it's the story element. What's great about it is that it depicts so many stories that you can empathise with. It's very unique in that you make painful choices that change the outcome of the story. I was overwhelmed by how the fascinating characters play an active role in the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How the story was designed, its core themes, and the creative collaboration behind it</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted to create the worldview of <em>The Witcher 3</em> within the world of <em>Sword of Convallaria</em>. However, it goes against Geralt's beliefs to get involved in conflicts between nations, and in fact, if we were to depict an epic story involving <em>The Witcher 3</em>, we felt that it would be quite a high hurdle to figure out how to resolve it. For this reason, we decided to aim for a down-to-earth story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story revolves around the Leshen from <em>The Witcher 3</em> appearing and causing trouble, and Geralt and his friends teaming up with the Leader to defeat it. Behind the scenes, the story also depicts the malice of people. For example, when a problem occurs, people assume that it is the work of those from a different background to themselves and blame them. The theme of the story poses a question of morality, as Geralt and Yennefer intervene to try to resolve this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In The Witcher 3, Geralt and Yennefer are portrayed as unusual people who present differently from the average person. Naturally, they have differing personalities and ways of conducting themselves. We made it a priority to carefully express the various facets of these characters in the collaborative story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We made sure to communicate closely with CD PROJEKT RED. We created shared documents, edited those documents, and received feedback, all of which allowed us to proceed with development meticulously and efficiently. This resulted in a fun development experience unlike any other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How they approached reimagining The Witcher 3 characters into the pixel-based world of Sword of Convallaria:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher 3 has a realistic 3D visual style, but when translating that into pixel art, our first priority was to think about how to express the movement in a way that would satisfy players.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the designers also love The Witcher 3, so they had fun designing it  with care, for example, to make it clear the difference between a silver sword and a steel sword. As a result, I got the impression that the visuals went smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The regions that were  main target for the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Worldwide. Sword of Convallaria is available in four languages: Chinese, Japanese, English, and Korean. As with The Witcher 3, we have a global perspective and want game fans around the world to enjoy Sword of Convallaria Sword IP. Therefore, every region is important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had to say, we're particularly interested in English-speaking countries. We see the English-speaking world as a region where we still want to gain more fans for Sword of Convallaria. It goes without saying that The Witcher 3 has already gained many English-speaking fans, so we hope that this collaboration will help us further appeal to the English-speaking world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Aspects that particularly stood out for him during this collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this was a true collaboration. The fact that both parties were working together in the same direction was a feeling I'd never had before, and it was a lot of fun. It was a wonderful experience for us. So, this time, we were able to communicate directly with CDPR, and not only was it very efficient, but we also felt that everyone gained something from this project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The part of the collaboration that symbolised its success, or made him especially proud to be a part of it:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s necessary when collaborating with other artists is love for the work. I think that only when we have a strong love for the work can we create something that satisfies our collaborators. We ourselves had always wanted to collaborate with The Witcher 3, but it was thanks to CDPR that we were able to make it happen. We are truly happy. We have also prepared skins for Geralt, Yennefer, and Triss. We have created skins based on the scenes that moved us the most while we were playing The Witcher 3. Geralt usually wears armor, but for this skin we created one that realistically expresses the love between father and daughter when Ciri visits Geralt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Triss, in The Witcher 3, Triss and Geralt attend a dance party. However, the two of them aren't very interested in the dance party, so they sneak out midway through and enjoy a date in the garden. We recreated that atmosphere with the skin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each skin was created with love, so I hope all players will check them out.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/sword-of-convallaria-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-collaboration-teaser-1-26-screenshot-1764948378963.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yennefer stands in front of a portal in the Sword of Convallaria x The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Official Collaboration Trailer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"> 
<strong>His message to the Sword of Convallaria players who are looking forward to the collaboration:</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all of our fans. It is thanks to you all that Sword of Convallaria has grown so much over the past year or so, and that we have been able to safely reach our first anniversary. Thank you so much! Thanks to everyone's support, we were able to collaborate with The Witcher 3. How will Geralt and his friends play a role in the world of Sword of Convallaria? We hope that not only the Leaders but also fans of The Witcher 3 will enjoy the event.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Other results vary from game to game and from GPU to GPU. <em>Borderlands 3</em>, for example, performs quite a bit better on Windows than on SteamOS across all of our tested GPUs, sometimes by as much as 20 or 30 percent (with smaller gaps here and there). As a game from 2019 with no ray-tracing effects, it still runs serviceably on SteamOS across the board, but it was the game we tested that favored Windows the most consistently.</p>


<p>In both <em>Forza Horizon 5&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077,</em> with ray-tracing effects enabled, you also see a consistent advantage for Windows across the 16GB dedicated GPUs, usually somewhere in the 15 to 20 percent range.</p>
<p>To Valve’s credit, there were also many games we tested where Windows and SteamOS performance was functionally tied.&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> without ray-tracing, <em>Returnal</em> when not hitting the 7600’s 8GB RAM limit, and&nbsp;<em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> were sometimes&nbsp;<em>actually</em> tied between Windows and SteamOS, or they differed by low-single-digit percentages that you could chalk up to the margin of error.</p>


<p>Now look at the results from the integrated GPUs, the Radeon 780M and RX 8060S. These are pretty different GPUs from one another—the 8060S has more than three times the compute units of the 780M, and it’s working with a higher-speed pool of soldered-down LPDDR5X-8000 rather than two poky DDR5-5600 SODIMMs.</p>

<p>But <em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>aside, SteamOS actually did quite a bit better on these GPUs relative to Windows. In both&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em> with ray-tracing enabled, SteamOS slightly beats Windows on the 780M, and mostly closes the performance gap on the 8060S. For the games where Windows and SteamOS essentially tied on the dedicated GPUs, SteamOS has a small but consistent lead over Windows in average frame rates.</p>

                <p>Nvidia today is the world's most valuable company with a market cap of more than $4 trillion, thanks in large part to the AI boom of the past few years. But Nvidia's success was far from guaranteed.</p><p>CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang recalled recently how a $5 million gift following a failed business deal with Sega gave the company the lifeline it needed at the time, allowing the fledgling company to stay in business and eventually become what it is today.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hptKYix4X8&amp;t=5567s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Rogan Experience podcast</a>, Huang talked about how, back in the 1990s, he and his two co-founders were trying to drum up business for their start-up PC company. They traveled to Japan and pitched Sega management on the idea that Nvidia could build the company's Dreamcast console.</p><p>Nvidia wasn't able to get it done, however, discovering that it didn't have the technical ability to give Sega what it needed (Sega would end up partnering with VideoLogic for the Dreamcast). However, Huang still wanted the last $5 million that Sega was due to pay Nvidia for its work on the contract. He told Sega management that Sega could give Nvidia the money as an investment, but Huang frankly admitted that "it is most likely to be lost" given Nvidia's lack of business opportunities.</p><p>At the same time, if Sega didn't give Nvidia the money, Nvidia would go out of business, Huang said. The Sega management team informed Huang that, even with the $5 million investment, Nvidia would likely still go out of business. "It was completely true," Huang said.</p><p>But a top Sega boss apparently took a liking to Huang and decided to give him the money as an investment because "Jensen was a young man [the CEO] liked. That's it." Huang said there was about a 0% chance that Nvidia would be able to return Sega the money.</p><p>Nvidia took that money and used it to help build and grow its business in the world of video games, and when Nvidia went public in 1999 at a valuation of $300 million, Sega cashed out. "If he would have kept that $5 million investment, I think it would be worth probably about $1 trillion today," Huang said.</p><p>Nvidia continues to be a big player in the gaming space with its GPUs and it runs the GeForce Now cloud-gaming platform. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/how-nvidia-makes-money-4799532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">How Nvidia makes its money</a> today derives more from sales to AI companies.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-m-ultra-gen2-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-just-a-hair-from-perfection</link>
            <guid>1374661</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="67780ae09ad49"><a title="M-Ultra Gen2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67780ae09ad49/m-ultra-gen2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cosmox Gaming offers up a <em>lot</em> of arcade controllers, including the modular <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price">Hautepad X</a> at a more premium price and the remarkably affordable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-c16-and-c16-s-arcade-controllers-for-switch-1-and-2-affordable-and-unique-in-equal-measure">Hautepad C16</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the company has launched the <strong>M-Ultra Gen2</strong>, an aluminium-built leverless that sits somewhere in-between the two. If the C-16 is primarily aimed at beginners and the X is for the more hardcore enthusiasts, then the M-Ultra Gen2 is, theoretically, for <em>everybody</em>. It’s quite possibly Cosmox’s best controller yet.</p>
<p>Priced at just over <strong>£110</strong> (or <strong>$149.99</strong> in the US), the Gen2 is more expensive than the aforementioned C-16 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo’s Arcade Controller</a>, but still sits comfortably toward the more ‘affordable’ end of the spectrum. You wouldn’t think that after going hands on with it, though. With its aluminium build, the Gen2 is a solid, heavy device that feels a lot more comparable to the Hautepad X.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-13CJKg9tJk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7rywsjh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The surface is slightly textured, meaning it won’t attract any nasty fingerprints when handled over time. With models available in both black and blue, I can’t say for definite whether the black version also repels smudges and grime, but the blue model has remained completely spotless after my time with it.</p>
<p>Like the previous models, the Gen2 is compatible with the Switch and Switch 2 right out of the box – just hold down the relevant button to enable Switch Mode while plugging the device in, and you’re good to go. Naturally, you can use the controller with most modern systems, but just keep in mind that you’ll need an extra authenticator to use it with a PS5 or Xbox.</p>
<p>Speaking of plugs, you get a braided USB-A to USB-C cable, which can either go into the top of the controller or over on the left hand side. If you opt for the top, Cosmox has included a new security clasp to lock the cable in place. You just pull the small switch down to open it up, and the actual port is housed about an inch inside. Once the cable is plugged in and the clasp is locked, there’s no way of accidentally yanking it back out – very handy.</p>

<p>The 16 button layout is pretty standard, with four directional inputs, eight action inputs, and four additional programmable buttons. They utilise Shadow Hunting switches, which are comfortably the lowest-profile yet, and this makes actuation exceedingly quick. In fact, the low profile makes advanced techniques like sliding easier than ever, while they still allow for other methods like double-tapping a single button with two fingers.</p>
<p>So all of this combined with the relatively close spacing between the buttons themselves make general gameplay feel more comfortable than ever. Seriously, if you thought pulling off combos in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> was easy on the C-16, then you’ve seen nothing yet – I wouldn’t be surprised if the Shadow Hunting switches just become the new standard going forward. It's incredibly comfortable to use, and I’ve no doubt it’ll give you an edge if you play competitively.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from the C-16, all switches include customisable RGB rings which you can tinker with on the device itself via several button combinations. If you want to go even further, you can connect the Gen2 to a PC or Mac and follow the URL address displayed on the controller’s screen to reach the web configurator. Here, you can set the RGB rings to whatever colour you wish and remap the inputs, setting several profiles depending on what kind of game you’re playing.</p>

<p>As is the standard now for Cosmox, the Gen2 also features its own OLED screen to display button-presses in real-time along with your input mode and SOCD mode (plus you can upload custom pixel art via the configurator if you want to personalise it even more). It’s larger than ever this time, which is great if you’re after a bit more clarity, though I’d probably prefer it to be situated more in the middle of the device rather than toward the left. Symmetry ‘n’ all that.</p>
<p>And of course, you’ve got a tournament lock switch on the top left alongside one to toggle the RGB lights on and off. Over on the right are your function buttons like start, select, home, etc. Everything’s labelled nicely, including the main face buttons, but keep in mind that when you’re in Switch Mode, the labels won’t match up with the actual in-game inputs. You’re not going to be looking at the buttons much either way, so it probably won’t matter, but if you’re sensitive about this kind of thing, it’s worth keeping in mind. If it really bothers you, then just remap the inputs via the configurator to match the labelling.</p>
<figure data-uuid="36fb367f2eebd"><a title="M-Ultra Gen2 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36fb367f2eebd/m-ultra-gen2-8.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I can’t overstate just how <em>nice</em> the M-Ultra Gen2 feels to use. With each new release, it feels like Cosmox Gaming is making more and more small tweaks to achieve eventual perfection. It’s not <em>quite</em> there yet – the 8BitDo Arcade Controller’s ability to dynamically change the button labelling is still a marvel – but the way the buttons feel and the overall build quality of the Gen2 is incredible. Simply put, this is the company’s strongest effort yet, and one of the best leverless arcade controllers available if you’re on a budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887">Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</a>,</em> out now in theaters, doesn’t sound like a good movie. And sure, the first film wasn’t a cinematic masterpiece, but according to critics, the sequel is even worse. It’s already one of 2025’s worst-rated movies, beating out some real stinkers.</p> <p><em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is the follow-up to 2023’s <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s</em> and, like that movie, is a live-action adaptation of the popular horror game franchise that features a lot of evil animatronic figures and tons of confusing and bizarre lore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-movie-review-box-office-1850974086">The original film was a big hit at the box office</a>, but took a beating from critics and ended up with an abysmal <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys">33% on</a> <em>Rotten Tomatoes.</em> I bet Blumhouse and Universal would love for the newly released sequel to have that score. Instead, critics seem to hate this new entry even more, with <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sitting at a truly awful 12% on the review aggregate site. Ouch.</p>

 <p>Here’s what various critics think about this latest horror sequel:</p> <blockquote><p>“Clunky, overstuffed, and strangely lifeless, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> trades genuine scares for incoherent lore. Even the animatronics can’t save a sequel that feels more like brand maintenance than an actual movie.” – <strong>Dionar Hidalgo, <em>Algo Más Que Cine</em></strong></p> <p>“[Its] sole imperative appears to be boring its audience to death.” – <strong>Nick Schager, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong></p> <p>“<em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> plays best for die-hard fans; for everyone else, it’s a stitched-together sequel with few scares and even fewer surprises.” – <strong>Allison Rose, <em>FlickDirect</em></strong></p> <p><em>“Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is one of Blumhouse’s worst sequels, nothing more than a cynical cash grab that treats its audience and fanbase like mindless children.” -T<strong>yler Taing, <em>Discussing Film</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_nights_at_freddys_2/reviews">And it goes on and on and on.</a> The consensus is that the movie is primarily designed to appeal to younger teens who are already obsessed with the franchise and will pick up on all the lore, Easter eggs, and secrets buried in the PG-13 horror flick. So it will likely make a lot of money, like the last one. But for everyone else, including people who like good movies, <em>Freddy’s 2</em> sounds like a bad time and one to avoid.</p>

 <p>Compared to some other stinkers released this year, <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</em> is up there. It has a worse <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_trek_section_31">Rotten Tomatoes score than the awful <em>Star Trek</em> movie</a> we got this year, which most people thankfully don’t know about. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie">It also has a worse <em>RT</em> rating</a> than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">utterly awful Jack Black led <em>Minecraft</em> film</a>, which is wild. It even has a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disneys_snow_white">worse score</a> than <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney’s terrible <em>Snow White</em> remake</a>, which, yes, came out this year. Remember that movie? Probably not.</p> <p>Oh, and if you are wondering, no, according to <em>Rotten Tomatoes, Freddy’s 2</em> is better than the <em>Borderlands</em> movie. But just barely, as that disaster of a flick from Eli Roth has <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borderlands">a 10% rating.</a> Better than <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912"><em>Borderlands</em></a> isn’t much, but it is something to brag about, I guess?</p>
