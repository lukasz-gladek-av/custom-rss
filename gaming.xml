			<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Starfield should be revealed and released this year, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, NateTheHate, who has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that the PS5 version of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda is planned to be revealed this year, although the timing of the announcement is not yet clear at the moment. The leaker also expects the gap between the announcement and release to be minimal, so the game should be available on Sony's console this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Starfield is coming to PS5 &amp; intent should be announced this year. It's just a matter of when will the announcement happen.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925235866357608928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I would expect the gap between announcement and release to be minimal.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925247880534602007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 port has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-release-playstation-5/">rumored</a> for a while, but no concrete evidence of the port being actively in the works surfaced online. The only hint we have received so far is the appearance of the PlayStation 5 logo on a Creation listing back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">March</a>, which suggested that the game isn't too far from releasing on Sony's current-generation console. With the "Not-E3" season approaching, it wouldn't be surprising to see the port officially announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Starfield launched in 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X|S, followed by the Shattered Space expansion in 2024. While the expansion provides a tighter narrative, it doesn't add anything the base game needs to become a better game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, future expansions will do a better job improving the game, which has, in my opinion, a lot of unrealized potential.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

To make it a little easier to navigate its digital world, the device includes a full color screen and complements its three button controls with a dial on the side for zooming from a view of the entire planet right down to the cellular level of your virtual pets.</p><p>Launching in Japan first on July 12th, 2025, for $45, the Tamagotchi Paradise experience starts with you hatching an entire planet in an event called the Egg Bang. From there you can zoom in on your world to one of three different unique ecosystems called Tama Fields that include land, water, and sky. Which ecosystem you start with is dependent on which of three colored versions of the Tamagotchi Paradise you buy, but you’ll eventually be able to unlock all three Tama Fields as you play.</p><p>Each Tama Field will affect how the Tamagotchi characters grow and evolve through unique activities and foods. The game includes over 50 different Tamagotchis separated into 12 different species that can be raised from eggs, but Tamagotchi Paradise expands that with a breeding mechanic so two compatible characters can create new Tamagotchi with 50,000 possible combinations available. Two Tamagotch Paradise devices can also be physically connected, letting characters from each interact to potentially start a family or become foes that prank each other and even get in fights.</p><p>If caring for a planet full of virtual pets isn’t hard enough, the device’s dial even lets you zoom in on Tamagotchis to the cellular level, which is how you care for and cure them when they get sick. It sounds exhausting, but unlike kids, dogs, or cats, if the responsibilities become overwhelming, you can simply pop out the device’s AAA batteries for some respite.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it looks new and shiny on Switch 2, it didn't always look this way, as Nintendo originally planned for the game to be Switch title. Doing so would’ve required lowering the resolution and frame rate, which, amongst other things, is what prompted Nintendo to shift development to the Switch 2.</p><p>This news comes from a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">four-part interview series</a> with some of the leads behind Mario Kart World, including producer Kosuke Yabuki, programming director Kenta Sato, art director Masaaki Ishikawa, general gameplay design lead Shintaro Jikumaru, and music lead Atsuko Asahi. In the interview, the team discusses an assortment of topics, including the new character designs, the interconnected world, and how the game began development on Switch.</p>

<p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” Sato said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">Part 1</a> of the interview series. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases. It was a tough situation.”</p><p>Sato said Yabuki first suggested developing the game for Switch 2 instead of Switch around 2020, but the team had to work on provisional estimated specs as the console’s insides weren’t yet finalized. He also said that while developing for Switch, the team “often worried” whether it could find the right balance between planning and performance, and with everything happening in Mario Kart World, it struggled to get it running at 60 frames per second.</p><p>Yabuki added, “We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we’d decided to release Mario Kart 8 – Booster Course Pass, we thought that would give us more time to continue development. That’s when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.”</p>

<p>In the interview, Ishikawa explained that migrating to Switch 2 encouraged the team to make the art richer and explore what it wanted to achieve in Mario Kart World. And thus, the Mario Kart World we’ll be playing on June 5 became what we’ve seen in trailers and screenshots.</p><p>Speaking of which, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gallery/2025/04/17/mario-kart-worlds-official-screenshots-are-delightful">check out this massive batch of Mario Kart World screenshots</a>, and then read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting"><em>Game Informer’s</em> hands-on preview of Mario Kart World</a>.

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Deliver At All Costs</h5><p><span>May 22, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-at-all-costs-is-a-top-down-action-game-published-by-konami/">Deliver At All Costs</a>, it was through Steam Next Fest buzz from earlier in the year. I didn't see much of it, I didn't even check out the demo at the time, because I was busy going through a bunch of other Steam Next Fest games. But I kept seeing it pop up on the lists I would read of Next Fest demos to check out. It looked interesting, and like it would be a fun and funny game to play for a few hours.</p>
<p>That cursory knowledge of it made me jump at the chance to review it, and now that I've played it all the way through, I'm glad that I knew next to nothing about it before going in. If I were more aware of what to expect, I feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed the best parts of Deliver At All Costs as much as I did.</p>
<p>But those good parts don't last, and by the time credits rolled, I was left hoping Deliver At All Costs hadn't tried to do as much as it did, and instead stayed closer to the ground as just a wacky delivery game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Deliver At All Costs starts as a small story about Winston Green, a young engineering prodigy that fell into some mysterious trouble that's landed him in an island town, living in a motel where he's about to be evicted, struggling to find work like everyone else on the island of St. Monique after a project connecting the island to the big city has crumbled the local economy.</p>
<p>A radio ad has you rushing to a local delivery company for a job, and it's here where you first experience the...annoying, to say the least, driving controls. On the one hand, I get it. The driving is supposed to be annoying to some degree, and that's part of the comedy that comes from the kind of oddball deliveries you make in the first two acts of the game.</p>
<p>The obstructed isometric view, what often felt like far too many townsfolk walking around and cars on the road, the hundreds of objects and environmental hazards, are all meant to up the ante when you're trying to deliver a bomb without it exploding on your way to its intended home.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I get what developer Far Out Games is trying to do. But the grace period my understanding offered ended well before Deliver At All Costs did. I spent most of my nine hours completing the story frustrated at best and laughing through mild annoyance at worst when it came to the core of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Those 'best' parts came early in my nine hours, when I was going from delivery to delivery, watching the stakes get raised in new and comical ways. I was also increasingly intrigued by how the story was evolving. Even at best, it was never as cinematic and dramatic as it was clearly trying to be, but the voice acting and writing had their moments that made me want to find out what happened next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I also appreciated the characters around Winston at the start, like Norman, Johnny and Harald. Even Donovan and Bertha, as antagonists, had potential in my eyes when I early on in my journey with Deliver At All Costs. Too bad nothing ever came of that potential. I'll hold off on story details for the sake of not spoiling the experience of anyone who still wants to play the game through to credits, but the bottom line is that the story goes nowhere.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's a whole lot of setup and no follow-through, with an ending that feels so disconnected from what the game begins as. Frankly, I would call the whole thing confusing, but I skipped past that and went all the way to relief that the game was over and I that once this review goes live, I wouldn't have to think about Deliver At All Costs again.</p>
<p>The story doesn't just stumble because it's undercooked, though. It was often impossible to take any of the scenes seriously because the way characters move and talk in cutscenes looked awful, and again, disconnected. The camera would be close up in a characters face, almost as if to make sure you watched how the characters mouth moved in entirely the wrong way for the words they were saying and that nothing looked synched up.</p>
<p>When it happens once or twice, it feels like a bug. When it happens in almost every scene, it starts to feel like something the team either didn't notice, or more likely they did, and had no time to fix it so it was left unfinished. Which is the sum feeling I got when I hit credits. That so much about Deliver At All Costs was unfinished.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>



<p>That unfinished feeling also didn't go away with the other half of how the story is told, through Winston's journal entries for each chapter. Jumping into the menu, you can read about events that aren't depicted in the game, but in some cases are unfortunately far more interesting than the events that did end up being depicted through cutscenes or gameplay.</p>
<p>As if these were the moments left on the cutting room floor that Far Out Games still wanted to include, since they were narratively important, but didn't fit in the production timeline the studio had. Again, it felt like I was playing a trimmed down, unfinished and bad version of a fuller, better game.</p>
<p>Save for one area of the game, and that's the setting. Exploring St. Monique, Shellington and New Reed felt like getting to play in three massive diorama's of different kinds of towns and cities. Like everyone you'd pass on the road was a little plastic or wooden toy that had come to life, and you're driving around and smashing up each area like a kid would, if they were given free-reign in the massive miniature city their parent had meticulously crafted.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Each location is extremely detailed, and while I didn't love having the screen go to black with a title card for every time you exit and enter different parts of the map or the interior of the few buildings you can enter, what got me through that was knowing I'd be met with a bright, detailed, and charming area to wreak havoc in.</p>
<p>The setting and visual style is so good, in fact, that I could have forgiven the story's shortcomings a lot more if the gameplay was worth sticking around for. Unfortunately, it never meaningfully evolves, in both the main and side missions, the latter of which are almost frustratingly inconsequential, as some of them have you track down other cars that you can do basically nothing with.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also a pretty huge miss that, in a game where you're encouraged to drive through buildings, you can't freely use whatever gadgets you can stick to your company truck to cause even more damage when driving through buildings or terrorizing the town.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm disappointed to have to say that I wouldn't recommend Deliver At All Costs. It's a game that tries to do way too much, and because it fails at so much of what it tries, it sours the experience of the things it was doing really well when you first start playing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Deliver At All Costs has some genuinely fun and funny moments in its early hours, when you're bright-eyed and looking forward to how the game could potentially evolve, and what crazy tasks you'll be asked to complete while destroying half the toy-looking city. Which is what makes it all the more disappointing that it goes nowhere, and you quickly realize that all you have is a game with (at best) mediocre controls, a story that has no follow-through for all its setup, and gameplay that never improves beyond what you could play in the game's free demo.</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Charming art style and exceptionally detailed areas

The studio’s newest game, <em>Blades of Fire</em>, is a tough action-adventure RPG with Soulslike elements and a surprisingly in-depth weapon-forging mini-game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,195579,196411" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The initial experience can be daunting. Tutorials are few and far between; players are simply thrust into the action. Enemies can easily overwhelm you.You need to be methodical in dealing with them, striking when the iron is hot. On top of this, you’ll need to be mindful in how you create your weapons to maximize damage. Here are some tips for starting out. So let’s go over a few early best-practices.</p><h2 id="h28965"><a id=""></a>Always carry different kinds of weapons</h2><p>This might seem obvious, but having a variety of different weapons at your disposal can save you from death. Whether you have a lance, hammer, or greatsword, every enemy has specific, yet different, weaknesses. </p><p>It’s pretty easy to tell which enemies have which weaknesses once you have a decent selection of weapons: Just lock-on to an enemy and switch between your weapons until a green outline surrounds the enemy. A yellow outline means the enemy has no particular weaknesses or resistances to the weapon equipped; red means they’ll resist damage from that particular weapon. And you’ll definitely want to pay attention to red outlines as hitting an enemy with something they’re resistant to can also damage your weapon.</p><h2 id="h28966"><a id=""></a>Experiment with the objective and outline settings</h2><p>Initially, <em>Blades of Fire</em> will not show you where your next objective is. Instead, you’ll need to go into the game’s settings and click the option that says, “Show next objective.” You’re required to do this every time you reach the next objective. It’s not ideal, but if you’re totally confused as to where to go next, see if objective indicators are enabled.</p><p>Other useful features include the “Enemy Outline” and “Outline Intensity” options. When locking onto an enemy, you can choose whether their outlines will always be on or off. You’ll want them on at first to see what weapons they’re weak to. But you can adjust how they look. The Outline Intensity slider lets you adjust how bold the outlines are. I prefer max intensity so I can clearly see what weapons my enemies were weak to.</p><figure id="" data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mercury Steam</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h28967"><a id=""></a>Break everything. All the time</h2><p>Like any other Soulslike, enemies in <em>Blades of Fire</em> will respawn every time you rest at a save point. By defeating enemies, you pick up a steady stream of materials needed to continue forging and crafting your weapons. True to its inspirations,another way to earn more materials is to just destroy every box and barrel you come across.</p><p>Don’t expect an item every time you smash up a box. Many are empty, but over the course of a session, you’ll come across enough items for the spontaneous destruction to be worth it. Hitting these also doesn’t degrade your weapon as hitting an enemy would, so there are literally no downsides to doing so.</p><h2 id="h28968"><a id=""></a>Don’t fear difficulty options</h2><p>Soulslike games are difficult, but some have managed to stand out by actually offering difficulty options. like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan"><em>Khazan: The First Berserker</em></a></span>. While <em>Blades of Fire</em> isn’t exactly a Soulslike game, its combat and difficulty are core to their identity as difficult games. Enemies swarm you constantly, and it can be easy to feel like you’re drowning in death after death. If you’re not paying attention, even smaller, weaker enemies can pile on enough damage to kill you before you know it. But you can make the experience easier.</p><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> has three difficulty levels: Bronze, Iron, and Steel. Even on the lowest Bronze difficulty, I still ran into difficult challenges with enemies dealing tons of damage and my stamina always being an essential thing to manage. The core of the genre doesn’t feel sacrificed by an easier setting; it just makes the game more approachable. </p><p>Difficulty level also affects your recovery time and the cost of repairing weapons. If you’re up for an extra challenge, go ahead and pick from the harder difficulties. But if you want an easier but still simulating time, Bronze difficulty should more than suffice.</p><hr><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> launches on May 22 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Epic Games Store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Let's HOPE Battlefront 3 happens."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past month has seen the popularity of Star Wars Battlefront 2 soar, thanks in part to the success of Andor's climactic second season, and other Star Wars activity surrounding the franchise's annual May 4 celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years averaging a Steam player count of around 2,000 players, the game's popularity has been steadily climbing over the past few weeks, and is now close to topping its 10,000-player all-time concurrent Steam peak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does this mean a Star Wars Battlefront 3 is now more likely?

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super Premium Collection is currently listed for a staggering <strong>$259.99</strong></a>, nearly <strong>three times its $89.99 MSRP</strong>... that’s a 189% markup for those keeping score. Walmart, for comparison, was practically giving it away at <strong>$59.99</strong> last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're dead set on owning the set, <strong>TCG Player</strong> is slightly more reasonable right now, valuing the box at <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$224.43 (Market Price)</strong></a>. That's still expensive, but you’d save over <strong>$35 compared to Amazon</strong>, and at this price point, every dollar counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk alternatives. There are <strong>15 booster packs</strong> inside the Super Premium Collection, but you could build your own haul for less. Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles (12 packs)</a> will cost you about <strong>$137.98</strong>, or grab three for <strong>$206.92</strong> to net 18 packs — more cards for less cash, albeit without the collector's box and goodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or skip the gamble altogether. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-super-premium-collection-where-to-buy">Prismatic Evolutions</a> singles trending downward, this might be the perfect moment to snag specific cards you want without rolling the dice. The bottom line? Big-box stores are the worst place to buy Pokémon cards right now — and the secondary market knows it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards: What to Buy?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While a few top-tier pulls like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORO5B?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Roaring Moon ex SIR</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3qew?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Vaporeon ex SIR</strong></a> are holding steady, or even creeping upward, a bunch of Prismatic Evolutions heavy-hitters are absolutely tanking in value right now.

But here’s the thing: pulling a Special Illustration Rare from this set is brutal. Thanks to those Pokéball and Masterball reverse holos clogging the rare slots, your odds are garbage. Booster packs are running over <strong>$10 a pop</strong>, and most people will burn through a mountain of them with nothing to show for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL57mM?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sylveon ex SIR</strong></a>: easily one of the most striking cards in the set. It’s dropped <strong>28% in just a couple weeks</strong>, from <strong>$562.60 in early May to around $400</strong> for a near-mint copy right now. If you’ve been eyeing it, this might be the sweet spot before prices rebound, and you’re definitely not pulling it from a single $260 Super Premium Collection box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Pokémon TCG Sealed Products</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a weird spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're desperate for some big box retailer products, here you go. Just make sure to be savvy before buying, as <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdblo5?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9 times out of 10 TCG Player will be cheaper</a> in this climate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There are few more iconic video game characters than Pac-Man. One of the earliest and most recognizable video game mascots, Pac-Man was a massive and ongoing success, as cabinets remained mainstays in arcades and restaurants for decades after its original release. Bandai Namco is celebrating the anniversary of the game on May 22, 2025--a full 45 years after its first release in Shibuya, Tokyo.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the simple character has gone through several redesigns and revisions, from 3D platformers to pinball and even a kart racer. Bandai Namco has made the character broad and flexible, with oddball experiments like 2005's Pac Pix living alongside respectful homages like the breakout hit Pac-Man Championship Edition, which played very much like the original with new mechanics and mazes to test the skills of even the most dedicated Pac enthusiasts. But the original Pac-Man, along with Ms. Pac-Man that followed, is still the purest distillation of the idea, a game that has been ported countless times and been played throughout the years.</p><p dir="ltr">To mark the occasion, GameSpot spoke with Cyrus Rosenberg, SVP of licensing and business development at Arcade1Up, which has made a point of producing nostalgic, arcade-accurate scale cabinets of some of the most beloved classic arcade games around, including Pac-Man. The company has produced multiple cabinets based on Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, so we spoke with Rosenberg about working with the Bandai Namco license to create cabinets that replicate the feeling of plunking a quarter into an arcade machine in the corner of a pizza parlor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749" data-ratio="1" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man stand-up cabinet from Arcade1Up</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, Rosenberg says that it works with the licensor to obtain original arcade ROMs and then puts in the work to make sure they convert cleanly to its own modern-day boards. The importance, he says, is capturing the essence of how the game felt.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes they are readily available. However, we go through an individual QA process on all ROMs, on all different machines to make sure that they are arcade accurate," he said. "And the way I personally, as a fan of our product, like to speak about it is it feels closer to what we're seeing in the modern video game remasters: as you remember, not how it was. And what I mean by that is we have fresh artwork, there's no broken controllers, it is essentially a brand-new arcade machine. Which you may remember, but actually compare it to what was in the original arcade, they may have been a little worn down from use."</p><p dir="ltr">And since they're using the original ROMs as the basis for their conversions, that means glitches are intact too. In the case of Pac-Man, that means that the <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Map_256_Glitch" rel="nofollow ">original Map 256 Glitch</a> can be triggered, if you have the skills to reach it.</p><p dir="ltr">Replicating that level of responsiveness with new hardware is an important factor, and that includes becoming intimately familiar with the original arcade cabinet. Small factors like the joysticks should be made to match as closely as possible, or players would notice that it doesn't match. Arcade1Up machines are typically built to three-quarters scale, so they're slightly smaller than the original arcades--and easier to fit in your living room--but other than that, the company aims for direct accuracy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Very similar to our ROMs, we always start with the model of an original machine. So even when it comes specifically to Bandai Namco products, there were some games that required a four-way joystick, some that required an eight-way joystick, but we always make sure they are a match to what was in the original arcade when it comes to format. Pac-Man's screen for example is a vertical screen and we made sure that the selected games list of ROMs that would match both the four-way control stick as well as the vertical screen itself. So again, while many of our arcades are about three-quarters scale, they do match the experience of an original arcade."</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Arcade1Up uses original artwork for its cabinets and converts them into the new form factor. Rosenberg says its key mission is "retro and authenticity," and so there could be minor shifts from artwork placement from the original cabinets, they should always be recognizably accurate to how the artwork appeared back in 1980.</p><p dir="ltr">Rosenberg says this approach to authenticity as a guiding principle was the result of feedback--fans wanted to see the same care and affection put into the cabinet hardware as the software.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an example of fan feedback really directly influencing our company," he said. "In our original launch in 2018, we had a design that we called the shark fin just internally. And what that really was is a standard format size arcade across all of the different units. However, almost one of the very first pieces of feedback we got on our initial launch was that people wanted to match the original cabinet shape. Now, when it comes to the history of arcades at large, there are only a certain number of those shapes so that there would be some crossover. We match the design for both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man as much as possible. So while size is not retained, the shape absolutely is one-to-one."</p><p dir="ltr">Ms. Pac-Man will be celebrating its own anniversary in 2027, and it's often known as the superior retro Pac-Man game--it was famously an independent project brought to Midway and adapted into an official Pac-Man game. That occasion is sure to make gamers nostalgic all over again. But as well-crafted as that improved iteration was, the original stands alone as the trailblazer. Even 45 years later, the original game holds up beautifully with a simple elegance that most games can't hope to replicate, and in its own way Arcade1Up is helping to maintain it.</p>

			<p>According to a report from<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-september-release/"> Insider Gaming</a>, the first major DLC release for Assassin's Creed Shadows, 'Claws of Awaji' is due to launch this coming September 2025.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji isn't the first new bit of story content we've seen for Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in March. That came from the update that arrived earlier this month on May 6, with a new story quest, 'The Works of Luis Frois'.</p>
<p>There's also going to be more story content coming in June, according to Ubisoft's current <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/">roadmap</a>, with a new quest and the addition of a new ally to add to the league of Assassins you build over the course of the game's story. Both the quest that came earlier this month and the new one coming in June were added to the game as part of free updates.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji will be the first bit of paid DLC content, and is expected to include an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">additional 10 hours of gameplay</a>, a new region to explore, and new weapons for players to rush head-first into battle with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Digital Deluxe Edition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_x9A5c2_TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And regarding more coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, Insider Gaming also claims that the previously rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/">co-op mode</a> will arrive sometime next year, and that while you might have assumed that a co-op mode in Shadows meant that you and a friend could play as Naoe or Yasuke, the mode will include more than just the game's two main protagonists.</p>
<p>On the co-op mode, Insider Gaming claims a source told them that, "<em>While they're obviously central characters [Naoe and Yasuke], there's a deeper narrative tied into the co-op that will expand the experience beyond just the two of them.</em>"</p>
<p>One of Shadows' main mechanics is the ability to call-up other members of the league during gameplay, which now feels like a precursor to this <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/">upcoming co-op mode</a>, if it is the case that you'll be able to take control of other league members in the yet-to-be-announced co-op mode.</p>
<p>While the fate of Ubisoft still feels very <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">uncertain</a>, Shadows has been the company's bright light for the year so far. It is currently the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">second-best-selling game in the US for 2025 so far</a>, with no signs of it slowing down.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-themed-booster-pack-coming-next-week.1196247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack, with Generation VII's cosmic Ultra Beasts headed to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Landing on May 29th,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>follows on from other themed booster packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow"><em>Shining Revelry</em></a>; it's not a full expansion like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Guardians</em></a>, but it'll still come with plenty of new cards for you to collect.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new Ultra Beasts for you to collect, including the ultra-jacked Buzzwole, the all-consuming Guzzlord, and the ethereal jellyfish-like Nihilego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=pzm2HdDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=-fiEAP6j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also expect other stars of Generation VII to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis</em>, including the likes of the legendary Pokemon Tapu Koko, the experimental creature Type: Null, and Alolan Diglett.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives a glimpse of an adorable full-art Rowlet card, in which everyone's favorite little spherical owl has situated himself in a hanging basket. I wish it was possible to be as comfortable as that Rowlet is in real life.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's essentially a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game. You can collect cards, trade them with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">up to a point, at any rate</a>), and battle to see who's the better trainer.</p>

<p>While the tabletop card game has some rather complex mechanics,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>is designed for mobile, so it streamlines things to allow you to get into and out of games quickly.</p>




<p>Released in October,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">an instant success</a> for The Pokemon Company and for developer DeNA, so you can expect to see new booster packs and expansions appearing in the game for the foreseeable future, at least.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie has been the center of several controversies lately, and last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">it was accused of using stolen art assets</a> in its upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. While Bungie has responded to the accusations--saying that a former artist was responsible and that it was investigating further--there have also been recent allegations that the studio's work culture has become tainted by toxic leadership.</p><p>Speaker to former IGN editor Destin Legarie--who now runs the independent games coverage channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>--former Bungie employees spoke out about the state of the studio, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly berate staff. It's also claimed that Bungie's leadership brought up the idea of adding a subscription service to Destiny, but this idea was strongly rejected by the developers.</p><p>Another example of the corporate culture at Bungie was that the studio's management allegedly expressed concerns over armor sets that could be earned in Destiny 2's PvP mode Trials of Osiris, because its design looked too good and could "impact" sales of cosmetic DLC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," one of these former employees said to Legarie, while another alleges that Bungie's current problems stem "from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p><p>Bungie has faced numerous problems over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">including mass layoffs</a> following the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that it plans to spin out Coffee Stain into its own entity by the end of the year, and that the group itself will also be undergoing a name change by that time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on the official Embracer website, Coffee Stain Group will be spun off "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers" by the end of the 2025 calendar year.</p>

<p>By that same time, Embracer Group will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment, completing the company's plan to spin itself off into three separate companies, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=L6LnZdIB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=JBm-3Fs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain will soon become its own entity.</figcaption></figure><p>Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh says the move to become its own entity will give the company "the clarity and control" to navigate a "competitive" industry landscape. He goes on to say the goal is still "supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain".</p>

<p>For his part, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says Westbergh's "strategy and leadership" will help Coffee Stain in "attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents".</p>

<p>As for Embracer itself, despite its new name, Fellowship Entertainment won't just be stewarding the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>IP (although that'll certainly be a major part of its mission statement).</p>

<p>The company will take with it other IPs like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>, for which a new game is currently in the works from developer 4A.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=D6GIwXz- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=x_vBraWs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fellowship Entertainment, formerly Embracer Group, will take properties like&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>with it to its new name.</figcaption></figure><p>Studios under Fellowship Entertainment's stewardship include the aforementioned 4A Games, as well as porting studio Aspyr, publishers Plaion and THQ Nordic, and&nbsp;<em>Remnant&nbsp;</em>developer Gunfire Games, among many others.</p>

<p>Embracer isn't technically going away, however; CEO Lars Wingefors will establish a new privately-owned company by the name of Embracer AB, which will hold shares in the three entities spun off from the former Embracer Group (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Asmodee</a>, Coffee Stain, and Fellowship).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Embracer's business strategy means for the studios under its wing, but for now, it looks like nothing in the immediate term will be changing. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/as-the-game-industry-cuts-back-accessibility-is-feeling-the-impact.1196211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game consultants like <a href="https://laurakbuzz.com/">Laura Kate Dale</a> came into 2023 with a lot of hope. Since 2020, accessibility in games had become a mainstream discussion, bolstered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4">high-profile releases like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a>, and it appeared things could only get better. Yet, as the year drew on, she says, “there started to be signs that, behind the scenes, accessibility advancement was slowing down.”</p><p>Now, that momentum has come to a relative standstill. Consultants speaking to <em>The Verge</em> paint a picture of repetitive conversations, fighting to maintain basics that should already be established, and a sense that the broader industry has taken its foot off the gas after the early months of the incipient covid-19 pandemic provided a real sense of hope that accessibility was here to stay.</p><p>“The gaming culture of that time is a reflection of catering to the disabled experience, because accessibility was sorely needed by <em>everyone</em>,” says Kaemsi, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaemsi">an online broadcaster</a>. “The rise of accessibility back in 2020 was almost a promise that, when we started recovering from the lockdowns, the world would start considering everyone in all facets of living, and all we needed to do was give people a chance to recover from having to deal with such an unprecedented time.”</p><p>But as that recovery set in, the world instead brute-forced a return to 2019 norms. Following lockdown successes such as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, the bubble burst. As industry-wide downscaling started partway through 2023, dedicated accessibility roles were among the first culled to save cash, according to Dale. “Gigs started to be cancelled without clear explanation,” she adds, while those accessibility champions that remained were told “their budgets were shrinking, or they were expected to fight harder to justify any new or more experimental investment in accessibility.”</p><p>Things are yet to improve. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">Layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619293/warner-bros-games-wonder-woman-canceled-studios-shut-down">studio closures</a> continue, while consultants who led the charge in 2020 are still fighting the same battles years later to maintain basics. “It can feel a little defeating to focus energy on fighting for standardizing things already proven to work and proven to win positive headlines from the games media,” Dale says.</p><p>Despite the media’s value as a way to start, and maintain, accessibility conversations, those positive headlines are also disappearing in a media landscape reckoning with its own calamity (most recently evidenced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/660635/polygon-valnet-vox-media-new-owner-interview"><em>Polygon</em>’s sale to Valnet</a>). As <a href="http://stevesaylor.net/">consultant and content creator</a> Steve Saylor suggests, outside tired cyclical discourse such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139208/another-crabs-treasure-review-xbox-switch-ps5">difficulty in Souls-likes</a> and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yellow-paint-game-design-debate">yellow paint</a>, accessibility topics have mostly fallen out of public consciousness. “There’s no nuance to that conversation,” he says. “People understand accessibility is important, but they’re not willing to learn more beyond that.” </p><div><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough.”</p></div><p>But that coverage is also critical for moving accessibility forward, providing publishers with a marketing incentive for accessibility features. “The less publishers are imagining their big stab at getting similar press coverage, the less they seem willing to take a chance on a feature nobody’s tried to offer before,” Dale says. She points to the extensive coverage <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>received for its accessibility prior to release as a major motivator for others to follow suit in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>Now, she adds, accessibility consultants are increasingly employed in scaling back accessibility, with the least backlash, to help mitigate the industry’s lockdown-era overspend. This creates an environment that isn’t conducive to change and improvement, and saps energy from an already frequently exhausted community. Professional opportunities have dried up to the point that many advocates are looking elsewhere for work, where only a few years before there was hope accessibility could become a full-time pursuit.</p><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough,” says Saylor, before adding that he’s barely had consultancy work over the past year. “I don’t know when it’s going to pick back up again. It’s been getting worse since 2023.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Even when the call does come, often those offers will end up being rescinded. “I’ve had at least three major AAA studios offer me accessibility consulting work in the past 18 months,” Dale says, “only for them to cancel the planned consulting work because the budget for that work was withdrawn by management.”</p><p>“People in the accessibility community are tired,” Kaemsi says, summing up how many speaking to <em>The Verge </em>feel. Nor does it look to be improving in 2025. As relations fray between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">Donald Trump’s government</a> and other nations, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/22/nx-s1-5336792/european-countries-canada-travel-warnings-us">with many countries issuing travel advisories to the US</a>, “it’s getting harder and harder to even potentially cross the border,” Saylor, who lives in Canada, says. “90 percent of my work was in the US and if that’s gone, I don’t know what that means for me going forward.”</p><p>Similarly, with so much of the gaming industry tied to the US, federal-level attacks on anything resembling inclusion in the name of pushing back against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656653/brendan-carr-fcc-anti-consumer-harassment-dei-trump">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies</a> (DEI) are making it dangerous for many advocates to continue fighting for inclusivity.</p><div><p>There is still some cause for hope</p></div><p>A side effect of so many consultants leaving the industry is that they’re also taking much of their knowledge with them. While many studios are maintaining features implemented in previous games, Dale says “knowledge of <em>why </em>those features are implemented, and why they’re handled in a specific way, is being lost.” </p><p>Per multiple sources, this has only worsened as the industry embraces contractors instead of full-time work, in which consultants are employed for a single project and then let go, often without leaving a record of their knowledge and practices behind, making communication even harder. </p><p>Dale cites multiple occasions where she was brought in to consult on separate projects for a studio only to find information wasn’t being disseminated across teams. “The end result is me being brought in to teach the same lesson more than once, a sign that somewhere along the line that knowledge isn’t making it from one project to the next,” she says.</p><div><p>Yet there is still some cause for hope. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games">Games like <em>South of Midnight</em></a>, which includes among its impressive accessibility suite the ability to skip boss fights, prove that accessibility remains a concern for many studios. In announcing the Switch 2, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessibility%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo has signaled its first stuttering steps</a> toward a more holistic approach to accessibility after years of stubborn resistance. Elsewhere, major publishers, including Nintendo of America, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633405/esa-accessible-games-initiative-nintendo-google-microsoft-ea-ubisoft">have agreed to share clearer and consistent information about accessibility on storefronts</a>.</p></div><p>These are small wins in spite of a broader industry slowdown around accessibility. If repetition is one signal of how profound that rut has become, it’s also perhaps an important tool for arresting this decline.</p><p>“Being repetitive, asking for features nobody is delivering, and asking for teams to try features until it’s embarrassing not to offer them,” Dale says. “That’s the only way things are going to change.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But outside of Star Wars, Fortnite is introducing a new character, Iridia Vayne, and the game is giving players a chance to win her skin for free. But you'll have to move quickly to catch this giveaway.</p><p>Starting on May 23, Fortnite players are invited to put a team together for Celestial Strike Quest, a new Party Up that will be releasing new quests daily until May 31. To unlock Iridia Vayne, teams will have to complete nine quests that alternate between earning XP in creator-made experiences and experiences that were created by Epic Games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1MD74TYHRg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V1MD74TYHRg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once the complete lineup of Celestial Strike Quest has been released, players will only have until June 7 at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET to complete the event and get the Iridia Vayne skin. There are also other items that can be earned along the way, as detailed below.</p><ul><li>Complete 1 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quest: “Alien Boy” Jam Track by Oliver Tree</li><li>Complete 2 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Victory Plume Spray</li><li>Complete 3 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Slashers Pickaxe</li><li>Complete 4 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Confident Iridia Spray</li><li>Complete 5 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Peacock's Dream Wrap</li><li>Complete 6 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Scabbard Back Bling</li><li>Complete 7 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: High Five! Emoticon</li><li>Complete 8 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Origami Battalion Emote</li><li>Complete 9 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Iridia Vayne Outfit</li></ul><p>Given Fortnite's history of bringing free skins back as paid items down the line, it's likely that Iridia Vayne's skin will also become available in the Fortnite shop in the near future. If you don't mind spending money on it, you can always wait. Or you can play with a few friends and make it your mission to unlock every reward being offered in this quest.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">drew an unfair-labor-practice complaint</a> from SAG-AFTRA, the guild that represents actors in Hollywood.
