		<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is sticking with the action RPG gameplay where gear and loot are a key part of your progression through the game. Weapons and gear come in various types and apply to different gameplay styles, but a basic tanto isn’t going to be anywhere near as good as a legendary tanto, and comes without perks.</p>
<p>Alongside levelling up and gaining Mastery points, you’ll need to look out for legendary chests and more. Here’s what to look for to get the best gear and loot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>.</p>

<li><strong><a href="#section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in AC Shadows</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section1">Assassin’s Creed Shadows loot tiers and perks explained</h2>
<p>Shadows has a loot system that uses the familiar common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary item tiers. The higher the tier, the more powerful the piece of equipment, generally speaking, though if you’re particularly lucky and get a good drop, an epic item could be more powerful than a legendary one.</p>


<p>Uncommon items and up come with a perk that can make a big difference, like increaseing armour when health is full, or boosting your damage per adrenaline chunk filled, whilst rare items and better can also be inscribed with another perk of your choice at the forge in your hideout.</p>



<p>Generally speaking the most consistently powerful gear you can count on finding is legendary gear. The stats are betters, the perks are better, and they probably look cooler too. The most consistent way to get it is by opening legendary chests.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to find legendary chests, but most reliably they are found in castles. To open a castle’s legendary chest you first need to defeat all the Samurai Daisho in that castle which can be a little time consuming, but you’ll also find a bunch of resources which you can later use to upgrade your equipment and earn Mastery points, so it’s time well spent!</p>
<p>You can also find legendary chests out in the world, and there are a few things to look out for. First, if you see some soldiers threatening a civilian and kill said soldiers, the civilian will reward you with your choice of either a scout support or some world information. The world information can sometimes give you information about a legendary chest nearby, or a kofun, which is a cave to explore with a legendary chest at the end.</p>
<p>You can also get locations for these chests in kakuregas, which are like outposts where you can fast travel to and restock your equipment. You can get radiant missions from here as well as areas to search for nearby content, such as legendary chests and castles.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Levelling up weapons and gear in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>
<p>Remember to pick up as many resources as possible as you play, as on top of the loot’s tier system, they also have levels. Once you’ve built a forge at your hideout you’ll be able to upgrade your gear’s level to ensure it’s still useful after you’ve levelled up a bit. When you upgrade the forge you’ll also be able to inscribe another perk onto rare or better equipment, giving you another modifier of your choice. These perks can be very useful and can be unlocked by completing certain challenges in-game, such as a certain amount of assassinations, as well as be rewards for completing certain quests.</p>
<p>One of the earlier legendary items I found was a tanto for Naoe that, after using a weak point attack (by holding R1 until charged) against a vulnerable enemy, would trigger another vulnerable state afterwards, allowing me to use another weakpoint attack and deal even more damage. As she’s a character that’s much more focused on speed, a skill like this was very useful, so I’ve focused on upgrading it ever since. Once you find an item with a trait that works well for your playstyle, you can keep upgrading it like this until you find a replacement that works even better, or that is so good that it changes how you play.</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it. Looting in Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes with the standard item tiers, but you need to keep a look our for Legendary chests to find the best gear, and then keep on top of upgrades to all your weapons and items.</p>

		<p>With the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get to play as not one, but two characters whilst assassin-ing your way around feudal Japan. Joining forces to thwart another evil plot, Naoe and Yasuke are both very different in just about every way, from their backgrounds and motivations to combat style, tools, and weaponry. As you switch between the two of them at will, you’ll need to adjust your playstyle to account for their strengths and weaknesses, and depending on your preferred playstyle you might wonder, can you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows only as Naoe or Yasuke?</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">Who are Naoe and Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Naoe – the sneaky Ninja Assassin</h3>
<p>Naoe is a trained shinobi who is out for revenge in typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, which means she’s both stealthy and sneaky, and your go-to for anything involving either of those two things. In addition to being small, quick, and not wearing clunky, loud armour, she also has a grappling hook to help reach rooftops and vantage points, and a set of tools – kunai, shurikens, bells, and smoke bombs. Naturally this combination of things makes her ideal for sneaking into a castle and methodically assassinating every poor guard who happens to be on duty.</p>
<p>She’s not useless in combat either. She doesn’t deal huge amounts of damage and might have a bit of a tough time taking out the implausibly giant guards, but she is capable provided you make full use of parrying and posture attacks on vulnerable enemies. She can equip two of a katana, a kusarigama, and a tanto/hidden blade combo to fight with and will need to be light on her feet to ensure she doesn’t get boxed in by enemies. The kusarigama will help with that, as its upgrades give improved crowd control.</p>



<h3>Yasuke – The towering Samurai</h3>
<p>Yasuke, meanwhile, is an actual samurai. And by actual, I mean he is based on a historical figure. The slave of a Portuguese Jesuit before Lord Oda Nobunaga took an interest in him, he became the first black samurai in history.</p>

<p>Yasuke is built for combat. In addition to being head and shoulders above most other people in the game, he can absorb much more damage than Naoe can, thanks to his full suit of samurai armour, and carries more rations to quickly restore health. He can choose between a long katana, a naginata, a kanabo, a yumi bow, and a teppo, which is a shotgun-like rifle.</p>
<p>Yasuke doesn’t have any tools, not even a grappling hook, and if you want a ranged weapon you’ll have to use one of your two weapon slots for a bow or teppo. The bow itself can be silent, but guards tend to find it a bit suspicious to see a giant pointing a bow at them. Yasuke’s biggest weakness is how profoundly un-sneaky he is – when he moves he makes more noise than Naoe, as he’s wearing a lot of armour, he climbs much more slowly, and when attempting a leap of faith he bounces right out of the haystack, though still without taking damage thankfully. However, Yasuke doesn’t need any of this. Stealth? He just wades into a camp and fights everyone at once. Climbing? Please, Yasuke can literally sprint through closed gates, breaking them into pieces.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Who is better in AC Shadows: Naoe or Yasuke?</h2>
<p>As fun as Yasuke is to play as, rushing right into the thick of the action and battering enemies, his impressive lack of stealth does make Naoe the better fit for the stealthy assassin fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series. Naoe is the better all-rounder.&nbsp;She can climb quickly, do the leap of faith, attack from range with her tools, and she has a wrist blade so she can assassinate properly as well, whereas Yasuke can only do “his own type of assassination” which usually involves a beheading and lots of noise. More importantly, Naoe can handle herself in a fight far better than Yasuke can handle stealth. It still won’t be easy when you’re fighting off half a castle as her, but at least she can drop a smoke bomb and run away to hide again.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Can I play as just one character in AC Shadows?</h2>
<p>The game is clearly designed to necessitate the use of both characters, as Naoe and Yasuke both have important roles through the game’s story, but if you have a favourite, then you can largely stick to playing as just one or the other.</p>
<p>You can switch at any time when in the open world, and major story missions are broken up with decision points to let you choose which character to play as for the next section, so you can simply pick to play as your favourite of the two at those points. The one sticking point is when you need to talk to specific NPCs as a particular character, forcing you to switch for at least a short time.</p>

<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, there is a dual-protagonist system similar to the one found in 2016’s Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate. It’s just as fluid, and you can switch between characters at the press of a button. However, the hulking samurai figure of Yasuke isn’t immediately available, but this guide will answer when you play as him in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Read on to find out when and how to unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but be prepared to put in the work.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-do-you-unlock-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">When Do You Unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>In the opening of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you get to control Yasuke for just a few minutes – but that’s enough to see what he can do. Naturally, you’d want to return to the role of the masterful warrior as soon as possible, but that’s not how this game works.</p>



<p>You’ll need to play as Naoe for several hours before you can unlock Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows – around 8 to 10 hours into the game. That’s how long it took me to get to a point where I could play as Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and that was by following the campaign and ticking off a few side quests along the way.</p>



<p>There’s a key turning point in the story – which I won’t reveal – that makes Yasuke available for open-world play. Once you’ve unlocked him, he remains around permanently, and you’ll be able to switch between him and Naoe relatively easily.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-an-assassin">Is Yasuke an Assassin?</h2>



<p>It’s obvious right off the bat that Yasuke isn’t a traditional assassin. This isn’t a spoiler, as this has been revealed in the run-up to the game’s release, but Yasuke is a samurai warrior with ties to Oda Nobunaga. Naoe is the ‘shinobi’ character with ties to the assassins as we know them, but Yasuke doesn’t fit that bill at all.</p>



<p>He’s clumsy when it comes to parkour, and he doesn’t have eagle vision or a hidden blade, so he’s not a typical assassin.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-rtx-remix-developers-respond-to-concern-from-some-fans-that-it-ruins-the-original-games-atmosphere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotly anticipated <a href="https://za.ign.com/half-life-2-rtx-an-rtx-remix-project" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> launches its demo today, March 18, and IGN sat down with its developers to discuss how they reimagined Valve’s 20-year-old masterpiece using Nvidia's RTX Remix tech, and debate the concern from some fans that it negatively impacts the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The modding team Orbifold Studios used RTX Remix to modernize Half-Life 2, adding full ray tracing, remastered assets, and DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation. It is free DLC for Half-Life 2 owners, and its demo is out now on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not everyone in the Half-Life community believes RTX Remix actually improves upon Half-Life 2. Various complaints based on early gameplay footage revolve around RTX Remix’s new lighting, which some have said “strips away” the original’s atmosphere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The iconic Ravenholm area is dimly lit in the original, but some fans say RTX Remix makes Ravenholm too brightly lit, reducing the effect of its horror ambience. “Ravenholm has gone from ‘moody’ to ‘obvious tech demo’,” one commenter said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The feeling is the pursuit of realism with RTX Remix pulls away from Valve’s original art direction, that artistic choices made by Valve over 20 years ago are negated by RTX Remix’s impact on lighting. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a point IGN put to David Driver-Gomm, co-lead of Half-Life 2 RTX Remix at Orbifold Studios, in our interview, the video version of which is above. In his response, Driver-Gomm said the modders were absorbing the feedback now, and insisted Half-Life 2 RTX was not a finished product by any means, so could be tweaked in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you have different tools, you make different decisions and you make some that are born of necessity and you make some that are born of art, and we have to try and unpick why they did what they did,” Driver-Gomm explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Did they do this because it was intentional or did they do this because there was a limit, right? That was done because that was what the engine at the time allowed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then when we come and we remake the zombie to a modern fidelity, we use modern technologies like ‘hair cards’ in order to achieve an end result that we hope would kind of be in the artist's mind's eye at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are going to be a wide variety of opinions. There's going to be a lot of people who feel like something would be done differently, and a lot of that feedback is stuff that we are taking on board and working with organically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then to a certain extent, some of it is just, we all love this game, so we all have very different opinions on how it should be treated and how the art should come across.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm then said that Orbifold Studios’ mod is its interpretation of Half-Life 2, and any mod team is free to have a go at making an alternative using the RTX Remix technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s moddable,” Driver-Gomm began. “Remix is out there, Half-Life 2 works with it because we're doing it. There is always room for people to put in their own interpretations, and I feel like that is the healthiest way to approach it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Half-Life 2 RTX is an interpretation, right? We're pretty proud of it. We think we're doing a lot of research to get it pretty on point. If people disagree, which is entirely their right to do so, then they have the tools to go and make that alternative interpretation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lighting isn’t the only complaint from some Half-Life 2 fans. Others have pointed to perhaps over-eager clouds of smoke emerging from fire and explosions may obscure the player’s vision. At one point in IGN’s demo gameplay, below, at 3:50 mark, Father Grigori’s shotgun blast and reveal is obscured by smoke, potentially causing the player to miss a key story moment in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Driver-Gomm said the team is already looking into the smoke issue, and explained their process there: “We have Source particle experts on the team and you can see the result of that with things like our new fires and our new explosions. In places where we haven't yet been able to author something different, we've been working with the base game materials and that's kind of how we've ended up where we are with that smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Again, it's an evolving process. Mods are not a thing that's like one and done and that's it, it's finished, right? That's never been mods. It's never going to be mods. It's always living and breathing. It's always responding to feedback. It's always deciding, does this person have a point or do I feel that my vision is worth pursuing, and hopefully the results will win out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is a complicated thing. We know we're doing something that a lot of people feel very strongly about here with remastering Half-Life 2, and key moments like that are things we are actively working on to make sure match up with the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But this is a demo. This is not the full final game. This is not us saying that this is it always and forever. The point of this demo is to go, we've done a pretty strong foundation here. We've covered a huge amount of assets, we've covered a huge amount of the environment. We want to see what the people think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the demo for Half-Life 2 RTX Remix now released, thoughts inevitably turn to whether Orbifold Studios will take on Episode 1 and 2 next. Driver-Gomm kept his cards close to his chest, but did say if his team doesn’t continue on, another could.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Episode 1 and 2 have a lot of assets which are shared with Half-Life 2, right?” he said. “Once we finish Half-Life 2, those will already be done by 70% for Episode 1 and about 50% for Episode 2. We'll have to see when we get there, but there's absolutely nothing stopping a community effort, even if we don't, from just picking up where we left off and wrapping up the work to be done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is a year-and-a-half old now, and we're still happily muddling through our second, third, seventh, 10th playthroughs. But with developer Larian choosing to step away from the series, that leaves Hasbro to sort out what it's going to do with Baldur's Gate in the future. Fortunately, it sounds like it won't be too long until we hear at least <em>something</em> about what's going on for the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference this week, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">with Larian moving on</a>, Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub also acknowledged that the pressure to get the next Baldur's Gate right is immense, and even bleeds over into other Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related, non-Baldur's Gate projects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/another-dungeons-dragons-video-game-in-production-at-hasbro">the game Hasbro announced last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm never one to shy down from a challenge," he said. "And I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke with Ayoub on a number of other topics, including Magic: The Gathering, its partnership with Saber Interactive, and Hasbro's overall game strategy. Keep an eye out for our full interview sometime next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-review.1138044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been a long time coming. Despite the clamouring of their fan base, Ubisoft held off for years on giving the people what they want, an Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan. Then, after finally announcing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the game was delayed at the last minute… and then delayed again. Thankfully the wait is over, the latest entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise is finally here, and it is utterly resolutely brilliant. Indeed, it might just be the best game in the storied series to date and Ubisoft’s best game in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Cinematic TV Ad" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxtJFdnMo7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, how do you like your Assassin’s Creed? If you prefer the stealth-focused and closed environment approach of the early games in the franchise, then Shadows is likely not for you. If, on the other hand, your preference is the open-word action RPG approach established by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a>, then you’ll find that Shadows is the epic culmination of everything you enjoyed since Bayek’s Ancient Egyptian adventure. Though, after the first eight hours or so of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this wasn’t the case.</p>


<p>Shadows is a slow starter, and while the drawn-out opening is full of great emotional beats and outstanding character performances, setting-up protagonist Naoe’s quest for vengeance, it is distinctly lacking in open-world activities and gameplay variety. When you’re not watching its admittedly very beautiful cut scenes, you’ll spend your time travelling from village to village murdering people, with a distinctive lack of tools and abilities to make it interesting to do so. During this opening section of the game, the limited areas of Japan you visit feel sparse, empty, as if something is missing. That something is Yasuke, and by the time the African Samurai strides into the game everything clicks, the open world reveals itself, activities and encounters fill the environment, the gameplay evolves, and finally Assassin’s Creed Shadows kicks into gear.</p>


<p>Yasuke plays in a completely different way to any protagonist in Assassin’s Creed history. He’s an unstoppable tank, like Batman from the Arkham series, as if the Doom Slayer was lifted from Hell and plonked into feudal Japan. Clad in robust armour, Yasuke shrugs off most attacks, smashing through opponent’s defences to complete a strike, even if it means taking some damage on the way. Later, Yasuke’s extensive skill tree can be harnessed to allow him to reclaim health from attacking, but in the early going you’ll be too busy grinning with glee as the mighty samurai boots an unwitting thug, sending them careening with rag-doll hilarity through the wall of a nearby temple. Combat is punchy and reliably structured around parries and dodges to expose an enemy to counter attack. Nothing groundbreaking here, but eminently satisfying, and I found myself playing as Yasuke far more than I thought I would, just to throw it down with another Daimyo or two.</p>
<p>Of course, many will lean towards playing as Naoe first and foremost, as she fulfils that more traditional role of the Assassin’s Creed avatar with stealth and athleticism. That means all your expected tropes, with free running, flipping, and leap of faith-falling aplenty. The extra time in development has clearly served Shadows well, as, for once, the free-running works perfectly. No more accidentally leaping off cliffs, Naoe goes where you want her to go, when you want her to go there, with smooth and precise animation. That’s not to say that this Shinobi doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Crawling through low cover is now an option, as is swinging on a grappling hook, allowing for different approaches on a target to be carried out – Yasuke simply can’t access rooftops and vantage points in the same way. More intriguing is that Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed where light and dark in the environment influences your likelihood to be seen. It now makes complete strategic sense to wait until dark before infiltrating a fortress, snuffing out candles as you making your way past hordes of enemies, practically invisible. To reach your victim unseen is a satisfying thrill, one that is sure to scratch the itch of even the most ardent stealth enthusiast.</p>

<p>Each player character has an enormous amount of differing abilities, weapons, and tools to mess around with. Yasuke’s shotgun-like Teppo is tremendous fun, thanks to the ability to switch weapons mid-attack meaning you can parry attacks from a sword, before spinning the rifle into position and blowing a foes’ face off Meanwhile Naoe’s standout weapon, the dagger-like Tanto, is far more exciting than it sounds, thanks to they way in which the Ninja slams it into to her victim with wanton abandon. Actually, this must be the goriest Assassin’s Creed yet – watching Yasuke slice off both his opponents arms before hacking off their head is quite the sight.</p>
<p>What really makes Assassin’s Creed Shadows tick though, is the option to freely switch between the leads depending on the situation you face and how you want to deal with it. A veritable army of Samurai blocking your way? Yasuke will carve a bloody path through them, but, if you’re not feeling the need for a fight, you can switch to Naoe and creep past them instead. It’s a shame that whilst the game encourages experimentation with its two player characters, offering open combat encounters to play around in, it makes it so darn clunky to swap between them, forcing you to dip into the menus to do so. This is particularly aggravating when you encounter a quest-giver for a specific hero, demanding you switch hero before you can interact with them. This is something they can hopefully refine in an early patch.</p>
<p>It’s in the depiction of feudal Japan that Assassin’s Creed Shadows truly delivers. Frankly, there are moments of jaw-dropping visual beauty here. You can spend ages just soaking in the vistas that stretch many miles into the distance. Blossom trees blow hither and thither in the wind, each branch moving independently of the others as blossoms float down to coat a woodland path. Seasons change and the environments with it, submerging villages in snow, or causing flowers to bloom in the summer. Waves lap against the shore, the sunlight sparkling across the water. Stunning is a word that doesn’t quite do justice to the environmental detail on display here, but it’ll do.</p>

<p>Unusually for Ubisoft, this glorious open world isn’t covered in icons and intrusive HUD nonsense. While you can still scan the surroundings from high-up vantage points, this doesn’t automatically fill your map with navigation points, instead insisting that you mark points of interest for yourself, and only a handful at a time. It’s less immediate, but it means you’re encouraged to explore the world more dynamically, search for your next target, find yourself distracted by an intriguing cave that you decide to explore, discovering an awesome new weapon hidden deep within.</p>
<p>Events occur organically around you, often dictated by the season. A peasant might need rescuing from some thugs, a passing Ronin might challenge you to a duel, or you might spot a lovely dog to pet and bring home to your hideout. There’s a wide range of activities to undertake, delightfully many of them avoiding combat to bring different experiences to the player. A forgotten crumbling temple becoming a free-running playground, a meditation point that brings transport your character into past events, taking the time to paint a playing bunny, clambering to the summit of a big waterfall to try and see if Yasuke can do a leap of faith – you’re definitely going to want to try it. In short, the world of Assassin’s Creed Shadows feel alive, with a historical and cultural authenticity that blew my mind.</p>

<p>The historical plot is smart and well-researched, brilliant evoking a Japanese Samurai cinema vibe with Assassin’s Creed’s own distinctive style. During your adventure, you’ll meet a who’s who of important figures from the period in their adventures, Oda Nobunaga and Hattori Hanzo are two early stand outs, but there are many more infamous characters expertly woven into proceedings. Thankfully, there’s also a minimum of modern-world nonsense here, with the option to explore digital anomalies and AI shenanigans if you want, but mostly letting you stick with the awesome feudal Japan setting. With all that going for the storyline, even a few blatantly obvious plot twists doesn’t change the fact that this is my favourite Assassin’s Creed setting and storyline by far.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin's Creed series</a> may no longer have the luster it had with the games starring Ezio Auditore, but there's no denying that there's still no video game series like it. While the stories featured in many installments may not be one hundred percent accurate to the time period they are set in, the ability to explore some of the world's most incredible places while getting to interact with real historical figures is something that very few games can offer at this quality level. With the introduction of role-playing game mechanics, some of the uniqueness of the series was inevitably lost, but the market seemed to appreciate this direction, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, even with its issues, achieved financial success, selling the highest number of copies during its launch weekend for the series.</p>
<p>Following the return to the series' roots with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the franchise doubles down on the open-world RPG formula this year with Assassin's Creed Shadows. While an entry in the series set in Feudal Japan was something that fans have been asking for for a very long time, the game has been very controversial since its reveal due to the choice of protagonists, mainly Yasuke, the first known African man in Japan who served Oda Nobunaga whose status as a proper samurai is still debated to this day, and other cultural mishaps, which include using a stolen flag design in concept art and a collectible statue of the game featuring a damaged torii gate resembling the ruined gate of Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki linked to the tragic 1945 atomic bombing.</p>
<p>While some of the complaints that have been raised are justified, I feel it would be a shame if the discourse surrounding the game were only limited to them, as I have found Assassin's Creed Shadows to be a solid game that improves on the series' RPG formula in a lot of ways and that takes full advantage of its incredible technical achievements to improve its open-world gameplay to make the experience more about exploring and living the world, rather than going from one map marker to the next.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250307184718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set in late 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the final phase of the Sengoku period marked by social upheavals and the unification of Japan under powerful warlords, which culminated with the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate by Ieyasu Tokugawa. The turbulent political situation of the period serves as the backdrop of Naoe's story, a female shinobi from Iga whose father has been killed by the Shinbakufu, a group of powerful individuals that move in the shadows to take advantage of the chaos enveloping Japan to further their own unclear ends.</p>
<p>Set on avenging her father and recovering a mysterious box Naoe's father told her to protect at all costs, the young shinobi embarks on a journey of vengeance that will get her to meet and act together with some of the most powerful men of Japan, and their servants, including the African warrior Yasuke, who will join Naoe in her quest for vengeance for his own personal reasons, which tie into the Brotherhood and Templar Order story previously seen in the franchise. The two will be joined during the course of the adventure by other individuals who will get to be part of the League Naoe has to put together to take on the powerful Shinbakufu.</p>
<p>While the premise is relatively straightforward, the story of Assassin's Creed Shadows is enjoyable, with some surprising twists related to the Shinbakufu that keep the player hungering for more until the mostly satisfying ending. Unlike Assassin's Creed Valhalla, whose story really started dragging on a dozen hours in, Shadows' story is much better paced and, clocking at around 40 hours, doesn't overstay its welcome, although some fatigue will inevitably start to creep in after 20 or so hours as some scenarios and individual storylines start to feel kind of repetitive. Still, there are definitely some remarkable moments in the adventure that make it worth experiencing, especially for history buffs who love the Sengoku period, as every major player of the late 16th century is present in some capacity.</p>
<p>Being the main characters, Naoe and Yasuke obviously get the most development, which is delivered in a series of quests that delve deeper into their pasts and how they got to the fateful day when the armies of Oda Nobunaga attacked Iga. Further development is offered during main and side quests, which delve deeper into their bond as well as into both their new and already established relationships. Those who like one of the two characters more than the other also have the choice of initiating quests with their character of choice, although there are times when both will be present or when either one of the two protagonists is required to proceed. Many other characters appear as the story dictates, but they receive limited development, which is not surprising considering their brief screen time, although the allies that get to be part of the League have a slightly bigger role than the characters who appear in the regional main quests, and thus stay a little longer in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Like in the prior games since the RPG shift, Assassin's Creed Shadows also allows players to make choices during pivotal moments that can heavily influence a character's relationships and how the story moves forward. Those who want to have a more traditional Assassin's Creed experience, however, can play the game in Canon Mode, which makes the story proceed as the developers intended. This is definitely a nice option to have and one of the many included in the game that further bridges the gap between the action RPG entries in the series and the classic formula that powered the first few entries in the franchise.</p>
<p>One thing that modern Assassin's Creed doesn't seem capable of bringing back properly is the modern-day story, and, as such, it is not surprising that Assassin's Creed Shadows fails in this area as well. The game serves as a starting point for a new modern story, but given how little importance it has in the game, it's clear that the developer focused more on getting their historical fiction set in the late Sengoku period right. For some people, they will have failed, as the two protagonists will continue to be controversial choices, especially Yasuke, who did appear already in other video games set in the late Sengoku period but never as a proper samurai, and details here and there remain inaccurate, but generally, Ubisoft, at the very least, attempted to address some of the controversies, such making it impossible to climb on torii gates, although this is only one of the many issues in the setting.</p>
<p>Would a traditional Japanese samurai have made for a better protagonist? Perhaps, but that would have required telling a different story. A key part of what makes Yasuke's story interesting is how he fits into a society so unlike the one he was born into, and his ambiguous historical role gave the developers more creative freedom to fill in the gaps. At the same time, the Assassin's Creed series has always taken liberties with real history, which led to plenty of inaccuracies, like the Icelandic Vegvisir magical stave appearing prominently in Valhalla when there is no known historical evidence that it was used during the Viking Age, so Shadows really isn't doing anything different in this regard.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311183830_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with its story, Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't exactly push the boundaries of the third-person action RPG formula established by its predecessors but introduces some choice improvements that really enhance the experience. While the player will still need to explore a huge map roughly the size of the map in Assassin's Creed Origins, heading towards certain locations to initiate and complete quests, how the player goes on to do this has been slightly changed. To start and continue a good portion of the game's quests, players first need to find where exactly to go, as the game doesn't provide a precise location from the get-go but only a few pointers, leaving players on their own to find out where they have to go.</p>
<p>The scout system can also be used to search an area on the map, but scouts have limited uses each season and can only be replenished by spending money, so searching on your own will be the way to go most of the time. And the most fun, to be honest, as it makes the experience more immersive than before, requiring players to look at the map and engage in a bit more organic exploration in the vein of<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/"> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">sequel</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a>, to name a few open-world games that mostly avoided the excessive use of map markers. Similarly, some of the game's side activities, such as those that involve hunting down the members of certain groups, also require the player to put in some work to find their locations, which makes these side activities more engaging than most of the others in the game. Those who prefer playing Shadows as if it were any previous entry in the series can just skip all of the above and turn on Guided Exploration Mode.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no way to completely turn off the map indicators, so you will still know beforehand the general location of points of interest, which include towns, enemy strongholds like castles, temples, individual challenges for Naoe and Yasuke, painting spots, and more. The vast majority of these locations are entirely optional to explore, but Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an incentive to do so by tying character progression with the Knowledge System. To learn additional skills on the twelve skill trees, six for each character, the player needs not only Mastery Points, obtained by leveling up and completing certain side activities, but also Knowledge Points, which unlock a new portion of the skill trees once certain point thresholds have been reached. Focusing on exploring the locations that are encountered while going for the main story objectives provides a decent amount of Knowledge Points, so there's thankfully no need to go out of one's way to explore every inch of the map to unlock fundamental skills for both main characters.</p>
<p>When it comes to variety, Assassin's Creed Shadows provides some in the moment-to-moment gameplay with a solid main quest design centered around the two protagonists and the open-world design technical advancements. After a certain point in the story, which coincides with a well-known moment in Feudal Japan history which takes place at Honnoji Temple, the player can switch at will between Naoe and Yasuke and becomes able to approach quests in two very different ways. As a shinobi, Naoe is extremely agile and comes with advanced parkour capabilities, which include a handy grappling hook that makes it very easy for her to stay concealed and eliminate targets with a bit of finesse. Yasuke, on the other hand, fully embodies the combat-oriented approach seen in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, coming with very average parkour abilities but a wealth of combat options that allow him to take on multiple enemies at the same time with ease, something Naoe sometimes struggles with due to her weapon options and skills. As such, every quest has been designed so that it can be completed with any playstyle, providing an unprecedented level of flexibility for an Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>Empowering the two different playstyles available in Assassin's Creed Shadows are some noticeable improvements for both stealth and combat mechanics. The former, in particular, has benefitted the most from the incredibly dynamic world Ubisoft created for the game, where sudden weather condition changes aren't just aesthetic but impact gameplay considerably. For starters, enemy visibility is heavily impacted by the time of day but also by certain weather conditions, so infiltrating a stronghold at night with a heavy rain downpour can prove to be beneficial for Naoe, who can use Eagle Vision to pinpoint enemy locations and mark them on the HUD with the Observe mechanics, no matter the visibility.</p>
<p>The lighting of any given area can also have a tremendous impact on stealth, so turning lamps and lanterns off can be incredibly beneficial and prevent enemies from being alerted by your character's shadow. All of these elements are further influenced by the current season, which can provide certain advantages or disadvantages, such as vegetation providing more cover, more frequent weather conditions changes, and so on. The enemy AI has been slightly improved as well, as they react to sound, which includes footsteps on nightingale panels, and group up when investigating anything that caught their attention. At Expert difficulty, enemies are even more observant, and even roofs become unsafe, requiring players to really be careful navigating enemy territory as any slip-up will result in getting discovered and potentially overpowered. The best thing about all of these features is how they dynamically interact with one another, forcing players to adapt to any given situation, elevating the typical Assassin's Creed experience in some surprisingly good ways, and making the Shadows' stealth mechanics some of the best in the entire series.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309175824_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The combat improvements are slightly less substantial than those made to stealth, but they are still quite noticeable, building upon the existing foundation to deliver something a little bit more involved. Both protagonists can unleash light and heavy combo strings, powerful Posture attacks, and special skills that require Adrenaline, block, dodge, and parry enemy attacks, but it's how they accomplish all of the above that differs. While competent, Naoe is not that great at fighting enemies head-on, thus her weapon of choices, which include Katana, Nanto and Kusarigama, don't deal the same amount of damage Yasuke's powerful long Katana, Naginata spear and Kanabo war club.</p>
<p>Her superior agility, however, makes her better at dodging enemy attacks, whereas Yasuke's heavier fighting style allows him to take a few hits, though he is still capable of sidestepping and backstepping to avoid attacks. By unlocking skills on the 12 skill trees and completing companions quests, it is possible to learn additional combat abilities for all available weapons, which include different combo strings, timed button presses for increased power and some passives, and become able to call in allies to fight alongside Naoe and Yasuke and even assist them when they are undetected, which, together with the many types of gear available coming, in their Legendary highest level of rarity, with some rather useful perks, expand combat options and make the experience quite varied. Some of the skills also allow both characters to use the environment to their advantage, adding more depth to the experience.</p>
<p>All of this wouldn't matter much if we were in the same button-mashing territory of some of the previous entries in the series, but this isn't the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Button mashing here leads only to dragged-out fights and higher chances of defeat, as enemies not only tend to block a lot, forcing players to use the slower Posture attacks to break their guard, but they also parry and counter reckless attacks. To get an opening, the player needs to pay attention to how they attack, deflecting or blocking their regular white and blue-coded attacks, and dodge the red-coded unblockable attacks. When defending properly with the correct timing, enemies become Vulnerable, allowing the player to deal increased damage. With enemies often ganging up on the player and even canceling their attack animations with sudden guards, the combat experience in Assassin's Creed Shadows can get rather intense, which is something I wasn't expecting. The excellent animation work in combat and some brutal finishers from Yasuke also contribute to making fighting enemies head-on as satisfying as assassinating them from the shadows.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311195407_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another major part of the Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is the Hideout mechanics. A few hours into the game, Naoe will get the chance to start building a haven for her allies to help her, and later Yasuke, in her war against the Shinbakufu, adding a variety of facilities that offer different services like a forge to improve equipment, a dojo to train allies, a Kakurega to improve safehouse management, and more, and introduce some beneficial effects like increased experience points and the like. By improving the Hideout, it will also level up and introduce some other beneficial effects that can be more or less useful. Those who want to combine looks with functionality can also freely arrange the buildings any way they see fit, decorate them with all sorts of items, connect them using some of the Engawa roofed corridors available, and so on. To do all this, however, players will need to use a lot of resources besides mon. These are mostly found by completing side content, such as the seasonal regional contracts, which often involve stealing resources or killing all enemies from enemy camps that are randomly generated on the map, bloating the already inflated wealth of side content even more.</p>
<p>While the typical open-world bloat has indeed been reduced over past entries, Assassin's Creed Shadows still features way too many side activities clearly designed to extend the playtime and get players to spend money on cosmetics and additional gear that add little to the experience. At the start of my playthrough, I tried to explore a bit more and see what was hidden below all those question mark indicators on the map, but I quickly changed my mind when all I found were similar enemy camps that provided small rewards that, ultimately, have little positive impact on the experience. My time with the game got way more enjoyable when I started doing things a little more organically, exploring whenever I felt like it when going from one main story quest to another, engaging with the additional system only when truly required, or halting my travels whenever I saw some villager in need of help, or a Shinbakufu ronin ready to fight.</p>
<p>This also made me appreciate more how dynamic and living the world is, as there are a lot of little details scattered around that enhance immersion, such as groups of women grieving their dead, people talking about their lives, and so on. Ultimately, the additional content is there for those who really want to fully complete the game, but I feel the vast majority of players would get bored of the game pretty quickly if they were to go after absolutely everything they see on the map, as the rewards aren't really worth the effort. Unfortunately, there are times when completing side content is essentially required to level up so as to be able to take on story quests, so avoiding side content almost completely is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows also marks the launch of the Animus Hub, the project previously known as Assassin's Creed Infinity, which will act as the immersive point of entry for the entire series, allowing players to quickly access any of the previous games they have purchased, access regularly released missions to obtain Keys that can be exchanged for rewards and more. The rewards offered for the current projects are decent enough, so these additional missions are definitely worth pursuing for those who are wholly invested in the game's many mechanics and systems. Those who feel the game is already bloated enough, even without the Animus Hub Projects, will end up ignoring them to keep the experience slimmer and more focused on story-related content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313193816_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before the game's launch a few months back, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Shadows would be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, and after having seen a good portion of what the map has to offer, I can say that is not only the most visually advanced entries but also one of the most visually advanced open-world games to date. Besides being extremely polished with little to no visual glitches, this rendition of Feudal Japan looks outright stunning, thanks to the great usage of ray-traced global illumination. With the Diffuse Everywhere option, and high ray tracing quality, the game's atmosphere is unparalleled at all times of day and weather conditions, making it a joy to traverse the game world bordered by dense vegetation, get up high on viewpoints, and see some of the most amazing vistas seen in open-world games to date. Ray-traced global illumination, lighting, and the density of the game world are only some of the remarkable visual features of the game, as particle effects are just as impressive as RTGI.</p>
<p>Whether it's leaves blown in the wind, pouring rain, or snowflakes, these effects do a great job highlighting the great attention to detail that has been poured into the game, which, at times, rivals that seen in Red Dead Redemption 2. The tech used for rendering hair is also one of the highlights and something that very few games have got as right as Ubisoft has in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Unfortunately, there are some stiff animations here and there that really feel out of place in such a beautifully rendered world, as do some mediocre facial animations, but thankfully, the vast majority of them are fine. Some are more than fine, such as combat animations, which feel incredibly smooth and well deliver not only the extreme agility and the extreme strength of the two main characters, but also their lack of. Yasuke's heavy parkour animations and clumsy leap-of-faith animations are great examples of this.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows PC 4K@60 Gameplay DLSS Quality, Frame Generation, Ray Tracing High" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkqOwIONdxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Experiencing Assassin's Creed Shadows at its best, however, has a cost, and only the most powerful system configurations are able to run the game at maximum settings, full ray tracing, and native 4K resolution at 60 FPS. Thankfully, the game scales really well across different system configurations, sporting a great variety of visual settings to tweak with a handy preview that highlights how each setting affects the visuals. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and the settings in the screenshots below, the game ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) with no visible stuttering, often hitting the 120 FPS mark, except for cutscenes, which are sadly locked at 30 FPS to retain a cinematic feel. The in-game benchmark also returned excellent results with unlocked framerate, hitting an average of 117 FPS, 99 1% low, and 93 0.1% low. Seeing the essentially bugless high level of technical polish on display here, there's little doubt that delaying the game multiple times was definitely the right choice, one that more publishers should consider to deliver solid PC ports.</p>

<p>While the Assassin's Creed Shadows visuals do their best to make players feel immersed in this amazing rendition of Feudal Japan, the same cannot be said for the game's audio features as a whole. The game's soundtrack is mostly fine, alternating between some rock-oriented and traditional-sounding pieces as the situation requires, but the English voice acting is most definitely not. Accents are all over the place, and the insertion of Japanese words into the English script sounds really forced at times, ruining immersion. Thankfully, the game offers an Immersive Mode where characters speak in their native tongues, Japanese and Portuguese, for the most part, where voice acting is of really high quality. Needless to say, Immersive Mode is the one to pick for the best experience.</p>
<p>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kill-team-blood-and-zeal-expansion-brings-ferocity-and-faith-to-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. The aptly named <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>, will not just introduce new factions to the skirmish game, but the introduction of two new mission decks.</p>

<h2>The <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qtq917vz/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-how-the-latest-expansion-set-changes-the-game/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop goes into detail about the <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> expansion. First, the expansion will introduce new units to the game: Khorne's bloodthirsty Goremongers and the militant Sanctifiers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=CTR09X2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=0r-bG8NT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But the big draw in this set is an exclusive set of 32 cards. Those cards are divided into two new mission categories: Blood and Zeal. Zeal mission cards represent protection and guidance, reducing wounds or preventing death. Alternatively, Blood cards are aggressive, providing bonus damage, extra movement, and even double Fight and Shoot actions.</p>

<p>Players can draw and play from either of these decks during the Strategy phase and whenever an opponent scores Victory Points. In addition, these cards can be used with any faction in the game. In addition, you can score additional Victory Points if you played the most Blood or Zeal cards during a match. This means no matter what you play, you have some extra options at your disposal.</p>

<p>These cards play into another new feature in <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. There is a shrine statue in the set; a focal point of supernatural power. While controlling the statue, your operatives can perform two new actions. Praise/Blaspheme lets you remove cards from your hand or discard pile and draw a new one. Hallow/Defile, allows you to draw a new card into your hand.</p>

<p>This means controlling the shrine statue can grant players a major advantage. It can lead to valiant standoffs or devastating slaughter depending on how the dice go.</p>

<p>These new mission decks will not stop with <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. The post continues stating each new Kill Team battle box will contain new mission packs. It mentions an upcoming box, Kill team: Brutal and Cunning, which will facilitate attacker/defender scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has a new patch that makes a raft of changes to the Paradox city builder's UI and systems such as traffic and garbage, while adding two new Easy and Normal difficulty modes and ten 'birthday parks' to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-celebrate-10-years-of-cities-skylines-with-a-roadmap-of-anniversary-goodies">celebrate the first game's 10 year anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The developers have also made some "quality-of-life improvements related to homelessness". That's "quality-of-life" in the vacuum-sealed software development sense of the simulation being nicer to operate, rather than quality of life in the sense of having a roof over your head. I would probably have gone with some slightly less dystopian phrasing, Colossal Order.</p><!--more-->
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 patch 1.2.5f1 adds a homelessness stat to the population info view, and makes homeless 'households' visible and selectable in park Selected Info Panels. "These changes make it easier to track homelessness, find homeless populations in your city, and check the situation for individual homeless citizens," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/604150552688854681?l=english">changelog</a> explains.</p>
<p>They've also tinkered with the game's systems to reduce homelessness in general. As of this new patch, "if the homeless in your city are generally employed, they simply need affordable housing," the changelog continues. "If they are also unemployed, they will need jobs suitable for their education level before they can leave the homeless status behind."</p>
<p>Colossal Order have also changed the logic for newly adult citizens leaving their childhood homes. Rather than leaving as soon as they reached adulthood, and becoming homeless if there were no affordable new homes to be had, they'll stay until certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Firstly, they'll need a job before moving out. Secondly, households will provide kids flying the roost with some starting funds for a new house: if there isn't enough cash to spare, the younger generation will stick around and contribute their incomes to the household. Thirdly, they'll now check for available homes before moving out. If there aren't any to be had, they'll leave the city and become commuters. That's to say, their housing needs will become another city's problem.</p>
<p>Going by the most recent Steam reviews, the big story with Skylines 2 is still the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">technical state at launch</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">shortage of features</a> versus its much-updated predecessor, but there have also been some headline-worthy twiddles for the economic and social systems. Last June, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-achieves-ultimate-catharsis-by-deleting-landlords-to-fix-spiralling-rent-prices-in-its-next-patch">solved the problem of soaring rents by deleting landlords</a>, a crowd-pleasing "quality-of-life" adjustment if ever there was one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like no matter where you go, Mappa is right there, ready and waiting with an anime something-or-other you weren't expecting. This time, you'll find the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, of all places, specifically in its first expansion pack Lost Colony. Studio Wildcard revealed a teaser of the expansion yesterday, set to be released November this year, showing off one of "numerous" anime cutscenes that it will feature focusing on the character Mei Yin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you couldn't recognise her voice from all the grunting she does in the trailer, Michelle Yeoh is reprising her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated series, and she'll be joined by Madeleine Madden as Helena Walker from the show too. The expansion will also include Moana's Auli'i Cravalho as Meeka, that little kid hanging out with Vin Diesel in Ark 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-stars-vin-diesel">reveal trailer</a>. And yes, Wildcard wants you to know that her presence alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a>, Genesis, and Lost Colony "leads into the events" of the sequel. Wildcard has been pretty quiet on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> since its announcement in 2020 outside of a few delays, so this at least marks some sign of life.

<p>
Lost Colony will feature the kind of additions many expansions do like new abilities, gear, building systems, things like that. Story wise you're being hunted by, uh, demons, it seems, which there appeared to be a taste of in the teaser above, in a "vast occupied city" called Arat Prime, the "birthplace of the Arks."
</p>
<p>
Ark 2 itself has been delayed numerous times, and was technically meant to come out last year, but considering Wildcard released a <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-440-ark-survival-ascended-content-roadmap-r2429/">content roadmap</a> earlier this year that featured plans for Survival Ascended all the way up to December 2026, and nothing for its sequel, you're probably safe to place a bet on it taking a while longer.

And the answer is yes. The extra power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S seems to have let Ubisoft’s artists and devs go wild. </p><p>This time around, Ubisoft has implemented  seasonal shifts and created four versions of its digital Japan for each season. So when winter arrives there’s snow and ice everywhere, changing how the world looks and feels. Summer brings lots of bright, sunny days, green fields, and bugs. Spring is filled with flowers and rain. And fall, my favorite season in the game and real life, changes Japan into an orange and red collage complete with strong wind blowing colorful leaves all around. </p><p>The end result is not only the best-looking <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game ever, but one of the most visually impressive open worlds ever created. As I played through <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>for review on my big dumb 4K TV, I constantly took screenshots because everything looked so good. The first time the game shifted into fall, when walking below some orange foliage I was bathed in an orange glow from the sunlight piercing the leaves above. It looked amazing, and wasn’t something I was expecting. The <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games have looked fine for a long time, but they never really wowed me until <em>Shadows</em>. And so, because I have so many screenshots, I decided to show off my favorites. Don’t worry, there aren’t any spoilers in here.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1e88a17141671edde8de85fad7598d7" data-recommend-id="image://e1e88a17141671edde8de85fad7598d7"

<p>The use of AI in video game development has been—and continues to be—a hotly debated topic among developers and players. </p>



<p>In its annual gaming report, Unity claims that 79% of the developers polled feel at least somewhat positive about AI’s impact on the gaming industry. More specifically, of the 300 respondents to the question, 48% felt somewhat positive while another 31% said they were “extremely positive” towards its use in game development.</p>



<p>“After ChatGPT hit the market, generative AI tools were suddenly everywhere, and a lot of game developers and other creators seemed apprehensive at first&nbsp;–&nbsp;but today, 79% of devs polled report feeling positive about using AI in gaming, while a mere 5% are apprehensive,” the report reads.</p>



<p>“Developers would benefit from AI tools that simplify playtesting and automate bug detection,” Pixonic marketing director Sola Saulenko said. “Additionally, AI-powered solutions for localization and quick translations of ad copy, or even generating initial sketches for concept art, could save significant time and resources.”</p>



<p>As far as the use of AI tools is concerned, that has held steady across the industry despite a growing positive sentiment. According to the survey, some usage of AI, for example in adaptive difficulty, as dropped while other areas such as automated playtesting has slightly increased.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Unity Gaming Report – AI Usage Survey</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Devs report picking up AI tools at a similar rate to last year, but AI applications and use cases have matured considerably in the interim,” the survey reads. “They’ve grown faster and are better trained, and we as users have honed our ability to guide generative AI toward desired results as AI use has grown normalized.”</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding adoption of AI tools, only 4% of those asked said they aren’t planning to use AI tools in any capacity in 2025.

<p>When you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll regularly come across buildings identified as ‘Kakurega’, but what are they and how do you unlock more of them? In this guide, I’m going to dive into the topic of Kakuregas and highlight how they help your playthrough. They’re super important, and you’ll want to acquire as many as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything about what a Kakurega is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-a-kakurega-do-in-ac-shadows">What Does a Kakurega Do in AC Shadows?</h2>



<p>Kakurega are small buildings that you’ll unlock all across the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and they serve as micro ‘bases’. They’re points at which you can restore your supplies, regenerate your Scouts, amend your Hideout, and accept Contracts. They also act as fast travel points, which is almost certainly what you’ll end up using them for.</p>



<p>Each Kakurega offers a tactical location at which you can generate more side missions or unlock more Scouts to search for objectives or smuggle back resources to your Hideout. I’ve covered everything you need to know about Scouts in another guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-more-kakuregas-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Unlock More Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>If you want more Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll need to have plenty of Mon, which is the money in this game. To unlock a Kakurega, you’ll first need to discover it on your journey, and once it’s marked on your map, you need to pay 800 Mon <strong>for each Kakurega </strong>to unlock it.</p>



<p>I’m not sure how many there are, but I managed to unlock more than a dozen in my first few hours of play – they’re <strong>everywhere,</strong> and they’re extremely helpful. </p>



<p>You’ll start the game with a core Kakurega in your Hideout in Tomika’s Homestead, but that isn’t one you’ll frequently visit – it’s much better to acquire Kakuregas on the road as you uncover the map.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally here, almost six months after it was supposed to be released. As a fan of the franchise since day one, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this open-world adventure set at the heart of feudal Japan, an era that players have been requesting for <strong>many years</strong>. It’s finally here, and I’ve already logged stacks of time exploring my authentic, dual-protagonist journey.</p>



<p>This game is great, but it’s not perfect. It’s one of the best ‘modern’ Assassin’s Creed games in the series, boasting the RPG mechanics and the gargantuan open-world environment we’ve come to expect from these titles since 2017’s AC Origins was released. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to land well with every fan – myself included.</p>



<p>Read on and check out my full Assassin’s Creed Shadows review to understand what I mean.</p>

<figure></figure>







<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has one of the most stunning worlds in franchise history. If there’s one thing I can say quite openly, it’s that 1579 Japan look <strong>gorgeous</strong>. The ability to move through seasons only adds to that beauty, allowing players to transition from the incredible colours of autumn to a world blanketed by a layer of snow in winter.</p>



<p>The world might feel overwhelming at first, but the pacing helps with that. Like in previous games, certain areas are considered off-limits until you’re tough enough to venture into them. And I mean <strong>off-limits</strong> – I found myself getting thoroughly humbled with a one-tap death from some hulking samurai because I crossed borders far too early more times than I can count.</p>



<p>It looks flawless on the surface, and everything from the weather systems to the dynamic day-night cycles works well. This is where my gripes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows start to surface, though.</p>



<p>For instance, wildlife is everywhere, but it seems far too random to make sense, and you can’t kill animals in this title, so the fauna doesn’t serve a purpose. Also, NPCs are going about their lives everywhere, but as with previous titles, they’re repetitive and <strong>never </strong>show any facial expressions, which always rubs me the wrong way.</p>



<p>If you choose to play via the non-guided mode, you’ll have to naturally explore the open world and find your objectives based on clues and tips, which is nice enough if you’ve got the time to do so. Exploring Japan in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nice enough, and there’s plenty of scenery and hidden locations to uncover, but ultimately, it’s <strong>yet another enormous Assassin’s Creed map</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-variation-by-design">Variation by Design</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The dual-protagonist system is decent enough, and it offers a good spread between tactics. In 2015, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released with a similar operating model, but Jacob and Evie Frye didn’t feel different <strong>enough</strong>. In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke and Naoe are <strong>poles apart</strong>, and they couldn’t be more different if they tried.</p>



<p>Yasuke is cumbersome but immensely powerful and imposing. Naoe is at the other end of the spectrum – she’s light, agile, and stealthy, but much more susceptible to succumbing to a brutal death at the hands of enemies. I’ve stressed that Naoe is the most entertaining character to play as in series history. She’s so fast and fluid, and her combat mechanics are intense and so refreshing.</p>



<p>It’s a very intentional split, and you’re often given the choice to play through certain sequences as either character, but open-world exploration can be completed as you see fit. If you prefer the heavier hand of an armoured samurai, then opt for Yasuke, but if you want to control a speedy shinobi, then you’ll pick Naoe.</p>



<p>Even stingers, responses to each character, and parts of the soundtrack are unique depending on who you play as, which is another neat touch. </p>



<p>The acting between each character is also superb, with special props being given to Naoe’s actor, Masumi Tsunoda, who makes her major video game debut in Shadows.</p>



<p>There are plenty of weapons to get to grips with, abilities aplenty, and stacks of skills to learn. The ability system works similarly to every Assassin’s Creed game since 2017, but these aren’t demigod warriors, so they’re a little more bound to realism, which I love. I was never a fan of the mythical stuff.</p>



<p>One complaint I have about the combat mechanics is that finishing moves become very old, very fast. In a single fight, you might see the same finishing move play out several times, which isn’t a good look. The game has some of the best stealth mechanics in history, but the open combat sequences could be a bit better.</p>



<p>Also, Yasuke might be a phenomenal powerhouse, but my word, he is clumsy. As you sprint around, he’ll clash with <strong>everything </strong>from barrels to fences and from screens to doors, falling head over heels through every breakable object in the world.</p>

<h2 id="h-authentic-but-empty">Authentic but Empty</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’ve explained that the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is beautiful and a wonder to explore, but the meaningful content spread around the world is quite thin. Most of the side objectives I picked up as I explored were simple tick-box quests such as ‘Kill 100 Enemies in <strong>This </strong>Region’ or ‘Find 10 Things in <strong>This </strong>City’.</p>



<p>The core campaign is great and extremely cinematic. The soundtrack and the visuals mixed with the set pieces and acting all win top points from me, but it’s the side stuff that needs sharpening. There’s just not a lot of weight to the filler content. The side contracts, the Shadows Projects, the collectable hunting – it’s all just bland and quickly becomes boring.</p>



<p>Do I really want to kill 100 bandits in a certain area five times to unlock a new hat? Probably not.</p>



<p>There is a <strong>lot </strong>of side content, from assaulting enemy castles to finding spontaneous missions from NPCs, but once you’ve done it all a few times, you’re left not wanting to do it again – but you <strong>need to </strong>if you want to unlock everything. </p>



<p>If you want to eliminate every target that pops up, you’ll be in for a pretty tough time, too. As I dug into Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I found myself constantly finding more circles of enemies to assassinate:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a similar story with the base-building elements of the game. You can build a full-fledged Hideout complete with multiple, open-ended buildings, ornaments, trees, rocks, and so on. It’s great, but I feel that the requirements for constructing certain buildings are unrealistic and such a grind, casting a pall over a feature that I was looking forward to.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent hours in photomode capturing every angle of this idyllic, incredible world, but there’s only so much depth you can get from snapping photos in a fairly empty world.</p>

<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s enough meat on the bones here to justify the purchase, and the game’s visuals, stunning world, and cinematic campaign all contribute to my recommending the title. However, the cracks in the game’s foundations are evident, the flaws that have existed for years are front and centre, and it’s not enough of a change from the formula that we’ve known for years to feel <strong>all that different</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is technically sound and authentic and represents a world that fans of the franchise have wanted to explore for many years. The artistic choices are great, the soundtrack is impressive, and the ambience is stellar, plus Naoe makes for a phenomenal lead, but there are just too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.</p>



<p>Buy it, but don’t expect anything too different from the last game – or the one that’ll probably follow this one.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest open-world epic in Ubisoft’s flagship franchise, and it teleports players to Japan in 1579. It’s a game set at the height of a disruptive, conflict-laden era, and with a dual-protagonist system fronted by both a samurai and a shinboi, the player finds themselves at the heart of that conflict.</p>



<p>I’m here to give you the ins and outs of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows story before you jump in.</p>



<p>Without further ado, what <strong>is </strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows about, and where does it fit into the overall landscape?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-explained">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Explained</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows opens up in and around 1579 in feudal Japan. The legendary daimyo, Oda Nobunaga, is seeking to unify the clans of Japan with an iron fist, but he’s being challenged by foreign oppressors and rebellious organisations lurking in the country’s shadows.</p>



<p>The game, which explores the late Sengoku period, tells the tale of Oda Nobunaga and those close to him, revealing plots and shady cabals working to bring down the would-be ruler and overthrow him and his people. The player will assume control of two protagonists – an honourable African samurai named Yasuke and a young but capable shinobi named Naoe.</p>



<p>Their stories, which start entirely separate, will intertwine as the game unfolds.</p>



<p>Players will explore nine regions of Japan, all of which are steeped in history, architecture, art, politics, and culture. From the hills of Iga to the monasteries of Yamato, and from the mountains of Tamba to the seascape of Wakasa, players will dive into a massive open-world environment in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, the player will be charged with taking down vast arrays of enemies. They’ll need to disrupt conspiracies, eliminate malicious groups, and topple powerful warlords. They’ll do this by assembling a network of confidants, utilising a range of period-accurate weaponry, and striking from every angle.</p>



<p>Players will ultimately learn about Naoe’s familial connection to the Assassin Brotherhood, discovering how and why she has acquired a hidden blade and why she has the typical talents of an assassin, like eagle vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Boasting an expansive roster of playable heroes and villains from across the Marvel multiverse, many with bespoke mechanics, Marvel Rivals presented developer-publisher NetEase games with a myriad of technical challenges to overcome, especially when optimizing the hero shooter for consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tieyi Zhang, a senior graphics engineer at NetEase Games, hosted a talk at GDC this year to demystify the process behind one specific mechanic: Doctor Strange's portals. If you haven't seen these portals in action in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Doctor Strange can open a portal from where he's standing to anywhere on the map within a certain distance. That portal will (in most circumstances) show where players will end up after passing through once the portal is placed. They work and look very similar to those seen in the recent Doctor Strange movies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although teleporting a player from one point of three-dimensional space to another already presents technical challenges for the device rendering the environment, the talk mostly focused on a greater challenge: how NetEase managed to render multiple angles of the same environment at the same time with minimal frame loss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhang walked the audience through the many steps of the rendering techniques used to produce the effect, discussed the inspirations behind the effect, and showed the differences in frame rate between various iterations of the technique during his talk.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/save-the-saves" target="_self" data-discover="true">Converting saves, a cross platform journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He started the talk by showing how the mechanic functioned when using a tool baked into Unreal Engine called Scene Capture 2D, which works like a virtual camera without any optimization changes. He introduced the tool, saying, “For those of you who are familiar with [Unreal Engine 5], the go-to solution for portals is the Scene Capture 2D component. As a built-in tool, it is perfectly documented and supported by many tutorials,” before going on to praise the tool’s “Consistent visual quality in creating captured content.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the tool’s apparent reliability, the frame rate dropped drastically as Doctor Strange passed through the portal in the videos shown in Zhang’s slideshow. The example shown onstage exhibited a doubled required rendering time, causing the game’s frame rate to plummet to roughly half. However, this could vary in extremity based on the complexity of lighting in the scene. Regardless, given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competitive bent, dropped frames during a match can be fatal, especially in such a competitive landscape where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/15-percent-of-steam-users-played-2024-s-game-releases">less than one fifth of active PC players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> play new titles.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/deep-dive-crafting-detailed-and-dynamic-water-in-planet-coaster-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Deep Dive: Crafting detailed and dynamic water in Planet Coaster 2</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It Takes Two"><span>It Takes Two</span> offered a guiding light</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, the engineer dredged up a surprising point of inspiration for his solution to this framerate issue: 2021’s widely acclaimed co-op hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Hazelight’s use of Unreal Engine to render two simultaneous views without drawing an overwhelming amount of power from the computer or console running it led Zheng to utilize a similar rendering technique for the portals. Zheng joked about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s largely airtight framerate, quipping, “Does this game use some kind of magic? I don't know!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using lagless split screen rendering techniques pioneered by Hazelight and EA’s heavy hitter, Zheng worked out an optimized, frame-efficient solution that took advantage of tech that’s usually reserved for local split-screen co-op, essentially placing another player into the game in order to render the view from the other side. This approach allowed NetEase to use the GPU on board the device much more efficiently, drastically decreasing dropped frames. But NetEase pushed things even further by skipping roughly every 5-10 frames per second within the portal, conserving the computer’s power even more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doctor Strange’s portals have proven to be one of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’ most beloved mechanics, with players finding clever placements and strategies that highlight just how versatile this tech can be, including a now-patched exploit that allowed players to essentially trap their opponents inside of a map’s geometry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/6-steps-to-a-successful-playtesting-process-for-an-indie-developer" target="_self" data-discover="true">6 steps to a successful playtesting process for an indie developer</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.
