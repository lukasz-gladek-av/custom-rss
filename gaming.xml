		<p>Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026,” the team wrote on a certain <a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">social media hellscape</a>. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”</p>


<p>The Amy Hennig-led superhero game was announced back in March of last year, having originally been teased in 2021. Plaion had been partnered with as the game’s publisher, and 2025 was the stated launch target, but we’ve had nothing since the cinematic reveal trailer last summer. We could get a gameplay reveal this summer, but it did feel like details were thin on the ground for a game expected this year.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s much better to take your time, get things right and try to release the best game possible… but depending on how big of a delay this ends up being, Skydance do risk slipping back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">that GTA 6 window</a>, which itself has just been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>

<p>The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-to-lay-off-3-of-its-total-employees.1188201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is about to lay off thousands of employees across all of its divisions, a new report released today claims.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CNBC</a>&nbsp;(which cites a statement given to it directly by Microsoft), 3% of all employees will be laid off "across all levels, teams, and geographies". That's CNBC's wording.</p>

<p>As CNBC points out, Microsoft counted 228,000 employees on its books as of June last year. That would mean that roughly 6,800 employees will be losing their jobs in the largest round of company cuts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-gaming-employees-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs-at-microsoft" rel="nofollow">since January 2023</a>, when around 10,000 staff members were laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=AdIDYF6M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=08Y7Teu9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of Microsoft's divisions, including Xbox, will presumably be affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement as loaded with corpo-speak as you'd expect, a spokesperson told CNBC that the layoffs are part of "organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>These cuts aren't related to performance, according to Microsoft; instead, they're about reducing "layers of management", as CNBC puts it.</p>

<p>Despite Microsoft wanting to "best position" itself for "success", it seems the company is already achieving that success. Back in April, the company celebrated a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buoyant third quarter</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, with revenue up 13% year-on-year and operating income up 16%.</p>

<p>Xbox's "content and services revenue" was up 8% in that same period, so whatever Microsoft's motivation is for laying off thousands of its employees, it can't be to turn around struggling fortunes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=uRU3z3jE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=bzJM5mfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's upcoming Xbox slate includes&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come just a couple of weeks after EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">announced sweeping cuts</a> to its own workforce, with&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> among the EA subsidiaries most affected by the layoffs. Other studios hit by cuts in recent months include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a> and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft again</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the staggering number of employees the tech giant has laid off in recent times didn't stop CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> in 2024. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Microsoft's Xbox division is gearing up (no pun intended) to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>later this year, and upcoming major titles include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: E-Day</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable</em></a>, although neither has a release date as of yet.</p>

As the name implies, the new SteamOS Compatibility system will rate how compatible games are with third-party devices, similar to how Valve already rates the compatibility of games for its own Steam Deck.</p><p>The new rating will only show up on devices running SteamOS that aren’t a Steam Deck and are designed to quickly indicate to users if all of a game’s features and functionality, including any anti-cheat tools it may be using, are fully supported by the OS. Games will be marked as either “SteamOS Compatible” or “SteamOS Unsupported” in the Steam Store and Steam Client.</p><p>The rating “does not include testing results for performance and input, since we will not know (and have not tested) how all titles will run on all potential hardware,” as Valve points out in an announcement shared to its community pages yesterday. But the company expects “over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate.”</p><p>Because the new ratings are “automatically generated from Steam Deck verification results without additional testing,” Valve says that developers don’t need to take any additional steps to ensure their games are compatible with third-party SteamOS devices. “If your title already has a Steam Deck Compatibility rating, an automated process will use that data to give it a SteamOS Compatibility rating.”</p><div><p>The Legion Go S will be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">first handheld gaming PC to trade Windows for SteamOS</a>, the gaming-focused operating system that powers Valve’s Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Anyone that's played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Souls</a> game knows how it tells its stories. You meet a wide range of characters, all of which mostly just talk at you in varyingly cryptic ways. There's also tiny bits of lore offered up from weapons and items too, all of which build up a messy picture. But in something like the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, where the main focus is gameplay that encourages you to constantly be on the move, I've been left wondering how its story will play out. As it turns out, it's quite different from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first">IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki set the scene a little bit explaining that "Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention - it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition."
</p>
<p>
That opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, the preset characters you play as. As opposed to Elden Ring, where there is a main plot so to seek, you'll mostly be trying to learn about the Nightfarers' respective pasts through Remembrances.
</p>
<p>
In Nightreign's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a>, you can check out the character you play as' Remembrances through a journal. Sometimes these are just logs, other times you'll be taken to specific areas to live out memories. Once you've spoken with an NPC within a Remembrance, you then get a task to complete. These vary from character to character, like how Wylder might need to go find a particular item in a cave, or how Raider has to win 1v1 boss fights.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'll have to wait and see how I feel about this structure when actually playing the game. I'm confident all the Nightfarers' backstories will have that classic FromSoft appealing vagueness, I just worry that they'll just feel a bit tacked on rather than properly woven in. Happy to be proven wrong, I do like the sound of each character needing to do different things, so I'll cross my fingers that it works out.

            <p>
Mark Barlet, founder of high-profile gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers, has been accused of fostering abuse at the non-profit for more than two decades. 
</p>
<p>
In a wide-ranging report published today by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">IGN</a>, former colleagues claim Barlet used sexist, racist and misogynistic language in the workplace, including about other employees, and made comments offensive to other disabled people.
</p>
<p>
One source claimed Barlet repeatedly referred to her as the company's HR representative, as she was the only woman in the business. The source claimed Barlet would then also make offensive remarks regarding her breasts in front of colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Barlet, who left the charity last September following an investigation by an external law firm, denies all claims of abuse and harassment. 
</p>
<p>
"After thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," Barlet said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
Other claims involve wasteful spending of the charity's funds by Barlet, involving first class air travel and extended hotel stays following business trips, and an expensive office charger for his Tesla.
</p>
<p>
In response, Barlet said his travel was justified by company policies, his extended trips were to cover additional business meetings, and his Tesla charger was just a "plug".
</p>
<p>
Regardless, it's claimed that an April 2024 investigation by  external payroll and HR firm ADP advised AbleGamers' board to part ways with Barlet, after concerns over his spending. 
</p>
<p>
This advice was reportedly ignored, prompting multiple employees to file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, prompting the latter invesigation that did then result in Barlet leaving the charity in September 2024 - albeit reportedly with a severance package. 
</p>
<p>
Since his departure, Barlet has started a new accessibility firm, AccessForge, while employees who spoke out about him claim they were subsequently forced out of AbleGamers by its board in retaliation.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, employees still at AbleGamers claim they have been repeatedly dissuaded from sharing their experiences for IGN's report. It's alleged that the charity's Steven Spohn has told staff not to speak out, for fear of "ruining the charity's reputation".
</p>
<p>
Neither Spohn or AbleGamers responded to IGN's requests for comment.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-h%C3%85g-capisco-is-a-great-chair-for-people-who-sit-weird.1188171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is an understatement to say that I have gained a reputation as a “chair guy” on account of the fact that I have <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found multiple Herman Miller chairs on the streets of New York City</a>. The Aeron is not my favorite chair, though she is indisputably an icon. My favorite chair is the weirdest one of all: the HÅG Capisco 8106, an ergonomic little freak chair designed for people who just can’t sit in one place.</p><p>The HÅG Capisco looks bizarre. Unsurprisingly, it was designed by a Norwegian industrial designer, Peter Opsvik, who also designed several chairs for children, kneeling chairs, and a lounge chair named “<a href="https://www.opsvik.no/works/industrial-design/garden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garden</a>” that looks like a tree with a bunch of orbs (AKA <a href="https://star-trek.design/seating/globe-garden-chair-by-peter-opsvik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the chair Worf uses</a>) I have often described the Capisco as “the art Delia Deetz makes in <em>Beetlejuice </em>but you sit on it.” Joe Rogan uses them in his studio, which is a bizarre reputation for this chair, but this is one of those rare instances where I agree with Rogan (along with his love of submission grappling and doing a lot of psychedelics).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Joe Rogan Raves About the HAG Capisco Chair – Find Out Why It's a Game Changer!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiwvBLp0OfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Unlike a traditional chair where you just sit in normally, the Capisco is meant to account for multiple seating positions. Some other, “normal” office chairs have elements of this flexibility. For example, the <a href="https://www.knoll.com/shop/en_us/home-office-ergonomic-work-chairs/generation-chair-by-knoll/1093.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knoll Generation</a> (which I once salvaged half a dumpster's worth of in midtown thanks to a reader tip) has a flexible back that allows the user lean on the top while side-sitting. But the cross-shaped back of the Capisco allows you to sit in ways impossible in other seating: forwards-facing, sideways, perched up high, and backwards with the seat back pressed against your chest – the “let me rap with you” position, or Riker maneuver as it is often called. (This chair has, in fact, <a href="https://star-trek.design/seating/capisco-chair-by-peter-opsvik-for-hag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been featured on <em>Star Trek</em></a> multiple times as well as <a href="https://focus.flokk.com/the-design-history-of-the-h%C3%A5g-capisco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Expanse</em></a>.) You can actually combine the backwards position with the lockable tilt mechanism, allowing you to face your desk leaning forward like you’re driving a Kawasaki motorcycle. This is appropriate, because Peter Opsvik based his design of the chair on <a href="https://www.opsvik.no/works/industrial-design/hag-capisco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the posture of horseback riding</a>, a dynamic and constantly shifting saddle that meets the rider as weight distribution changes.</p><figure><figcaption>$150 on Facebook marketplace well spent. Just needs new seat foam. </figcaption></figure><p>I own two Capiscos. The best-known model is the HÅG Capisco 8106, but my first was a “Puls” model I got cheap on Craigslist from a startup guy in Tribeca who got it with a Covid stipend and said his “wife hates it.” The Puls is a budget friendly version that swaps much of the fabric back out for rigid, injection-molded plastic. This is far more useful if you are in a medical environment or someplace where you may easily stain the fabric, but some people may just enjoy the feeling of rigid plastic on their skin. I do not, and for that reason the chair is now on semi-permanent loan to my local hacking space. But the Puls gave me a taste for the real thing. and I have been quietly searching <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-marketplace-is-not-fun-to-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a> for an 8106 ever since. This week, I found someone who had one sitting in storage and on a severe discount because it needs replacement foam on the seat. After a long and complex ride via public transit (it was raining and no cabs were available), my baby was home.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The top of the legs features flat, ridged surfaces that are perfect for perching.</figcaption></figure><p>There was a time several years ago when everyone was praising standing desks, which resulted in a boom in their production. The idea is that it is not natural for a person to be sitting for extended periods of time, and even the nicest chair is going to do a number on your back. The other advantage is that even if you don’t use a standing desk for its stated purpose, it’s still an affordable desk that’s easy to adjust the height of. With my Aeron I do not use my standing desk to its potential, but the HÅG Capisco positively sings with it. I find myself adjusting both my standing desk and Capisco multiple times to rapidly change to a more stable sitting position. It is also possibly the only chair that consistently gets my arms into an ergonomic typing position with my equally <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freakish split keyboard</a> from both a forward and backward seating position. That said, lest I besmirch the Aeron too much, I like having it in my office as well for when I need to just sit normally for like 20 seconds.</p><p>While the Capisco is designed with flexibility in mind, it is also far better at suggesting that the user gets into an ergonomic frame of mind. Sat in the most traditional way possible, the seat forces your hips into a wider stance, while the sides of the cushion roll off gently, relieving pressure on the bottom of the thighs (to me, the Aeron’s biggest Achilles heel). The cushioned but semi-rigid nature of the backrest makes it difficult to slouch, and the arm rests being behind the back lead the user to organically adopt a position with good posture. For example, if you use the arm rests in the forward position during a typing break, the elbows tend to fall to the side or even behind the user, forcing the elbows to pinch together, thus ensuring ideal posture. If you have ever seen a person lean on the edge of a Jacuzzi, imagine that arm position but lower.</p><figure><figcaption>The various forms of the Capisco: the Puls, the 8106, the headrest variant, and converted to a stool. Credit Flokk. </figcaption></figure><p>But the Capisco also allows for potentially freakish ways of sitting. You can perch on the edge, basically using it to half sit and half stand. It is a chair that is meant to be fidgeted in, leaned on, and very importantly perched on. The legs of the chair feature ridged surfaces which are perfect for putting your feet up on, thus removing the need for a foot rest, although they do offer a comical one that snaps into the base called the StepUp, as well as a headrest, which looks <a href="https://www.rethinking-ergonomics.com/product/hag-capisco-headrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bizarre even compared to the chair</a>. A good friend of mine, who snagged two Capiscos relatively cheap when a startup went bust, has the model with foot rings which he loves for this specific purpose.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hag Capisco (with Hag Stepup) Ergonomic Office Chair with Sit Stand Desk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5r0Lun5HbrU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The HÅG Capisco 8106 fares better than many chairs in terms of basic repairability. The back rest is attached to the base with a single hex bolt, which allows the chair to be converted to a stool in under a minute. I have taken apart many office chairs with complex mechanisms, and the Capisco is surprisingly straightforward despite its strange appearance. If it has a weakness it is that, like all cushion-based chairs, the seat foam will eventually deteriorate and the fabric may need to be refreshed or cleaned. Like most seat parts, replacement foam can be bought from your local distributor. When it comes to the fabric, a surface cleaning will suffice most of the time. But for removal, while the upholstery on the backrest upholstery has zippers that allow it to be removed easily, the mechanism for the seat fabric is more elaborate and annoying to remove. If I had to change anything, making that easier would be on the top of my list. That said, these are relatively minor complaints for an otherwise simple, easy to service chair.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How to change the seat upholstery | HÅG Capisco | Flokk Repair Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbIwQcz9B9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While the Capisco is not a chair I would recommend to everyone, I find that people who sit on one tend to like it more often than not. It is an office chair that exists outside of tier lists because it’s off in space doing its own thing. I can imagine a well-meaning but oblivious Hank Scorpio-style CEO buying a fleet of these in the startup boom only to have a few of his employees resent him and bring in folding chairs after a month. But for a certain kind of person, there is no better chair for sitting, or leaning, or perching like a freaky gremlin. I have heard from a friend it is fantastic for shorter people (*cough* Joe Rogan *cough*). This is a chair for vigorously Scandinavian people and L from <em>Death Note</em>. Though you technically are sitting in a Capisco, it is functionally so anti-chair that I hesitate to call it “sitting.” Welcome to “Sitting 2.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-sold-new-owners-jeff-fandom"><h3>Giant Bomb Has Been Sold To Giant Bomb</h3></a><p>'Giant Bomb has new owners, and you're looking at them'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Nintendo Today app has revealed more of the small features that are featured in the Nintendo Switch 2, little technical quality of life tweaks that will hopefully make the system a better one for the long haul.</p>
<p>For those keen to keep their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> private, a PIN code lock will be available within the regular system settings, so you can set a code and keep pesky siblings, children, spouses and public transport thieves locked out from&nbsp;<em>your</em> games – obviously the last one would suck so much more if it happened to you than other people in your life just messing with your games.</p>


<p>The original Nintendo Switch also had a PIN code lock feature, though this was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Change-the-Parental-Controls-PIN-1494765.html">tied in with the parental controls</a>, and much less obvious for most users.</p>
<p>Another good feature for those who fuss and fret over battery capacity of their precious smart phones and laptops is the battery saver mode, which lets you tell the Nintendo Switch 2 to stop charging at 90%. This is good for those who tend to keep their consoles docked and rarely play handheld, where having a battery-powered device constantly connected and at 100% can negatively impact capacity – the data on this is a bit fuzzy for if it will help in day-to-day handheld use, though.</p>

<p>And finally, with the Joy-Con 2 able to switch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> at the twist of a wrist, the Switch 2 Home screen and all the system settings and menus can be navigated with a mouse pointer. A small thing, but kinda neat?</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a few weeks away from release on 5th June 2025, coming alongside Mario Kart World, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a pair of Zelda Switch 2 Edition titles</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/all-the-confirmed-nintendo-switch-2-launch-titles/">a plethora of old, new and enhanced third party games</a>, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization 7 and more. Of course, you also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">a huge back catalogue of compatible Nintendo Switch titles</a> that you can still dive back into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Codemasters and EA Sports have unveiled several details of their upcoming racing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a>. The most interesting one for our readers is undoubtedly the detailed list of PC requirements, with recommendations for every target, including Virtual Reality, 8K resolution, or path tracing.</p>
<p>According to the developers, F1 25 will require a GeForce RTX 5080 or AMD RX 7900 XTX graphics card to play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with upscalers (presumably NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, respectively) set to Quality. Weirdly enough, while the 8K spec does recommend using Frame Generation, the path tracing spec does not. Perhaps, with Frame Generation enabled, the recommended spec can actually reach 4K@60 frames per second.</p>

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> has the bones of a great action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>," I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">wrote last November</a>. Developers Digital Extremes continue to graft flesh to those bones, plumping the world-building's marrow and cranking the sinews of the combat. The game's Preludes edition - a sort of relentlessly expanding limited-access beta - <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/patch-notes/0-9-0">continues to be updated</a> with new weapons, faction features, player Pacts (classes, essentially), areas, and enemies. They've also made some revisions, which include turning the Idol system into a distinct set of weapons so as to give it "a more focused purpose in your arsenal".</p> <!--more-->
<p>Despite promising myself that I would try to keep up with Soulframe's development, after flopping out of the FOMO boat with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, I managed to overlook the original edition of the Idol system. Digital Extremes have certainly been busy, and more is in the offing: the 10th Preludes update, due this month, will further expand upon the new Motes and Runes upgrades system while adding some throwable secondary weapons and a wizard's staff with respectable Dragon's Dogma energy.</p>
<p>Here's a trailer to show off the Preludes build as it currently stands, plus a few of the aforementioned new trinkets.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mLydrgmH4g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>So how do Motes (which already exist to some extent in-game) work as upgrades? As detailed at <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/news/soulframe-at-pax-east-2025">PAX East</a>, they're tiny Ghibli-ass critters you'll find around the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. Once caught, they can be ordered to take up possession inside a weapon to provide a new ability - freezing enemies solid, for example.</p>
<p>You can also release them if you have a duplicate Mote to acquire feeding materials for your remaining Motes, strengthening them. Or, you can have your weapon's Mote feast on the soul of an enemy. In the dev stream, Digital Extremes jocularly observe that none of this is anything like Pokemon. They've clearly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">keeping up with current events</a>.</p>
<p>Runes, meanwhile, are modifiers for Motes, placed in sockets on your inventory. They grant boons such as more staggering power after you nail a perfect dodge. There are 20 new Motes coming in Preludes 10, and the hope is to let players start properly build-crafting in a simulation that has hitherto been more about levelling up and acquiring more potent gear.</p>
<p>Upcoming new enemies, meanwhile, include a boss, the Tired King, whom the devs liken to the Ringwraiths in LOTR. He doesn't seem tired so much as great at delegation, summoning minions to attack you. They're also working on the second Soulframe in-game event, the Festival of the Circade. Where the first was Halloween-flavoured, this one takes inspiration from recent house-wrangling doozie <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> with a new puzzle location, the Crypt of Circade.</p>
<p>All these bits and pieces notwithstanding, I still find Soulframe appealing for approximately the same reasons I did in 2024. It casts you as a lonely roving paladin in a realm of enchanted animals that is being steadily ruined by pollutant-spewing oiks in metal hats. It blends sword and sorcery into a graceful procession of combos, parries, buffs, projectiles and finishers. I wouldn't say the combat is very difficult or complex but it has fluidity and charisma. I enjoy inhabiting a body that can do stuff like this.</p>
<p>The dungeon ambience is fairly absorbing as procgen creations go, and the lore writing has a gnarled, fey intensity that sometimes comes across as garnish for a nothingburger, but is often quite fun. The weapon and equipment art is as handsome as you'd find in Warframe, but not as 'extra', you know? A little easier to behold without developing a migraine. Forgive me, Warframers - I am old, and brighter colours upset me. I like my tapestries faded, my armour dusty and my blades notched and blunted... but not broken.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There will soon be a new compatibility rating on Steam store pages for games. Valve has announced that SteamOS hardware other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a> will get its own checkmark, meaning the title will work with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve went over what this new rating will mean <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">on Steam</a>, adding that roughly 18,000 games should be compatible with SteamOS from the jump. "SteamOS compatibility ratings are based on a subset of the Steam Deck compatibility testing results and are meant to show at a glance whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," the announcement post reads. "This includes features like game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support."</p><p dir="ltr">From the developer side of things, Valve is saying that it doesn't need to do any extra work to ensure SteamOS compatibility for its games. The verification can happen automatically apparently based on the Steam Deck verification process. Additionally, Valve is promising that "SteamOS compatibility results will all be the same or higher than Steam Deck verified results."</p><p dir="ltr">So far, the only other SteamOS device is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">the Legion Go S handheld</a>. However, it's clear that Valve envisions this segment "expanding to more devices in the future." Meanwhile, Microsoft is reportedly teaming up with Asus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-photos-leak-as-xbox-app-gets-handheld-friendly-update/1100-6531368/" data-ref-id="1100-6531368">an Xbox-branded ROG Ally 2, which leaked</a> last week.</p>

But economic shifts in the industry seemed to drive the company to surface at the 2025 Game Developers Conference.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the event, Havok announced a new pricing model for developers working on budgets under $20 million. The company's normally high-end offerings haven't been affordable for many developers, and while they aren't ready to support low budget indies just yet, general manager David Cochrane told Game Developer that the company now wants to work with studios with "tens" of employees, not necessarily "hundreds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers on those lower budgets can now license tools like Havok Physics and Havok Navigation for the low low price of $50,000 per Havok product. There's no royalty fee, and studios can also use plug-in versions of the tools for Unreal Engine.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/how-avowed-s-qa-team-stomped-out-bugs-by-working-inside-the-design-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Avowed's QA team stomped out bugs by working inside the design tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To see a company known for selling premium tools for big-budget games open up to the lower-tier market is quite a phenomenon—especially in an era where the biggest hits of 2025 include </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>RuneScape Dragonwilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Small games are becoming bigger hits—and to hear Cochrane tell it, Havok seems to be following the trend.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Havok is the rare middleware company to last 25 years">Havok is the rare middleware company to last 25 years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cochrane explained to Game Developer that Havok began planning the new pricing scheme after studying how many mid-sized studios were planning more ambitious games using Unreal Engine. Havok is a "good fit" for Unreal he said, and to see developers embracing the kinds of solutions Havok offers—but not being able to afford its offerings—began to shift their thinking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the kind of adaptation Havok has made repeatedly over the last 25 years, following what Cochrane described as the "creativity" of developers. But it's not the kind of creativity you might think of at first glance. Cochrane praised the gameplay advancements and new kinds of ideas that emerged from the last two-and-a-half decades, but the company's primary focus has been the creativity of technical problem-solving the industry has produced. "The industry has always found creative ways to deliver games that make the most of the of their chosen platform," he said, alluding to the ways developers adapt to online networking or "diversity of hardware." Most recently, he said Havok has paid close attention to the rise of powerful handheld devices like the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck—and how developers are making "new kinds of games" suited for those devices.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-s-ceo-cto-promise-stability-after-runtime-fee-debacle" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity's CEO, CTO promise 'stability' after runtime fee debacle</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But not every trend Havok's been around for has stuck. He recalled the rise of early Facebook games around 2009-2012. If that trend had stayed around, Havok would have been in a tough spot since Facebook games don't need expensive physics or cloth simulation technology. "There was almost a sense of 'was the whole industry gonna have to pivot hard toward this?'" he recalled.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't. "There can be a new style of game that comes along—whether that's a live service, or whether it's a social game, or whatever—when MAU numbers are high, the whole industry will take notice, but the game industry always tends to drift back toward an equilibrium which involves many different types of games across many different platforms."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So even with the surge of fast-followers for UGC games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—few of which need Havok's high-end physics and cloth technology—Cochrane said there will still be an audience for games gushing with plentiful particles.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-scratch-coding-and-discipline-at-the-heart-of-animal-well" target="_self" data-discover="true">The scratch coding and sharp constraints at the heart of Animal Well</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The next space for innovation: AI navigation">The next space for innovation: AI navigation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like everyone else at GDC, Cochrane had a lot to say about AI—but not the same kind of AI that had everyone else aflutter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cochrane explained that Havok's most overlooked product its its AI navigation tech—but it's also one the most quietly groundbreaking pieces in the company's portfolio. "What we're really seeing now is an increased diversity in the the scale of different characters that [players] come across in a game," he said. Games have had enormous enemies for years, but newer pathfinding tech allows gigantic creatures to share space with smaller in-game characters instead of having their own dedicated areas.</span></p><p>Image via Havok.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He referenced FromSoftware's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> here, a game where players can be fighting twisted knights in ruins one minute, then be ambushed by a dragon the next, often in the same area.

"The reality is...the sizes of worlds that people are dealing with at the moment are stressing some of the historic techniques that would have been used to build [methods] for navigation," he said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-modding-is-about-to-get-much-bigger-thanks-to-official-release-of-dev-tool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The modding scene of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 on PC is thriving, to say the least, with a dedicated community that even somehow managed to expand the PvE Operations mode to support <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 12 players</a>, as if it were an MMO-like raid.</p>
<p>Now, though, the developers from Saber Interactive have opened the door to much bigger and deeper tweaks and improvements to the game with the release of their internal development tool, the Integration Studio. The tool can be downloaded from the <a href="https://discord.gg/QRWxNCDDdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Marine 2 Modding Hub Discord channel</a> and weighs less than 50 MB. Here's what Space Marine 2 Game Director Dmitry Grigorenko said in the announcement:</p>
<p><em>This is the exact same editor we use internally for all gameplay development. No more editing files in Notepad and praying you didn’t miss a bracket — Integration Studio makes editing anything SSL-related ten times faster, safer, and more intuitive.</em></p>
<p><em>With this first release, you’ll be able to work with:</em><br>
<em>• Level scenarios</em><br>
<em>• Game modes</em><br>
<em>• Individual blueprints — and even write your own gameplay logic</em><br>
<em>• AI Behavior Trees (work in progress)</em><br>
<em>• The AI Director</em><br>
<em>• Abilities and melee combo logic</em><br>
<em>• VFX editing — now 100x easier</em><br>
<em>• UI and HUD elements</em><br>
<em>• …and more to come</em></p>
<p><em>And this is only the beginning.</em></p>
<p><em>Not long ago, I promised we would support the modding scene — and we meant it. Watching this community grow, push boundaries, and create incredible experiences has been both inspiring and humbling. We’re excited to see what you build next — whether it’s a cinematic campaign, wild new game mode, or something we never saw coming.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has been a smashing success for Saber Interactive, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling over five million units in around three months</a> on the market. It was so successful that they already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3, although there's still a meaty content roadmap planned for the current game, and the release of the modding tools will undoubtedly improve the game's longevity for PC users.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft is laying off three percent of its workforce across the business - potentially including its gaming division.</p>
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a> report, following Microsoft's latest financial report from the end of April where it announced an 18 percent year-on-year increase in net income - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">five percent increase in gaming revenue</a> specifically.</p>
<p>"We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.</p>
<p>Back in June last year, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, meaning that a three percent drop would amount to approximately 6840 people - though of course employee numbers may have fluctuated, especially following other rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>As such, this would be the largest round of cuts since the company laid off 10,000 employees in January 2023. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, The Coalition, and 343 Industries were all affected.</p>
<p>Since then, Microsoft has continued to lay off staff. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>, with a further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff laid off in September</a>.</p>
<p>Already this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">Microsoft laid off a "small" number of employees back in January</a>. While these cuts were performance-based, this new round of cuts are not related to performance, the Microsoft spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for further comment on whether Xbox Studios are impacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft confirmed it would be raising the price of its Xbox console across the world</a>, with some new games costing $80.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5s-best-selling-games-last-month-were-all-from-xbox">Microsoft-published games even dominated the download charts on rival console, Sony's PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-requested feature lets you level up most primary weapons by completing missions, unlocking new attachments and patterns for requisition in the process. It should allow players a much higher level of precision over how their favorite weapons look and feel, letting them mix-and-match from different sights, ammo clips, and recoil dampeners. Most importantly, it’ll give diehard recruits who have been helldiving for hundreds of hours something new to grind toward. </p><p>The latest patch also adds new enemy types to the ranks of the Illuminate. There are the Stingray jetfighters that will deploy strafing runs against players, Crescent Overseers bombarding from the skies, and Frankenstein’s monsters called Fleshmobs that sound like Cronenbergian abominations as nasty to behold as they are to try to kill.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-precinct-review.1188078/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-precinct-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Deep in the pre-history of 1997’s original Grand Theft Auto, an earlier gameplay concept that was being noodled on within the halls of DMA Design initially would have had us playing as <em>police</em>. Eventually the call was made to pivot and exclusively focus on the <em>wrong </em>side of the law, because it was decided being a criminal was way more fun than being a boring old cop. GTA as we know it was born and, a bazillion in sales later, it’s hard to argue they made the wrong decision. However, nearly three decades down the track, The Precinct has arrived to remind us that there actually <em>is </em>a way to make upholding the law just as engaging as breaking it, in an old school, GTA-inspired sandbox city. The Precinct may be a modestly sized package overall – and the crime-busting gameplay loops it throws at us do eventually become a little samey and worn over its roughly 12-hour campaign – but its isometric, grimy ’80s aesthetic is absolutely excellent and there’s real novelty in patrolling the rain-slick streets, seeking to chip away at Averno City’s neverending supply of miscreants, mobsters, and malefactors.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Setting The Precinct in the ’80s is the single best decision developer Fallen Tree Games has made here. There’s no cyber crime, social media, or mobile phone nonsense cluttering up proceedings. Rather, it’s a world detached from all manner of modern crap; it’s just you, your partner, and a radio. The Precinct is nothing if not an earnest and distinctly 20th century cops ’n’ robbers playground, and it’s all the better for it – it’s like an old TV show. I feel like my CD collection would probably make it clear I understand that police accountability is not a new debate by any stretch but, hey, even Henry Rollins found a way to go from spraying cops with Black Flag lyrics to playing cops in The Chase and Bad Boys II. The Precinct just wants to let us screech in, sirens blazing, and save the day. This is not a game that attempts to grapple with controversy, or the seedier side of ’80s policing – it’s an idealised portrayal of cops and how they’re supposed to properly protect and serve, rather than a commentary on how they actually do it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Precinct is nothing if not an earnest and distinctly 20th century cops ’n’ robbers playground.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At its core, it’s an action-packed ode to iconic 1980s police procedurals and movies; every day would be the busiest and most dangerous day of any actual cop’s career, baddies are cuffed and booked without delay, and the city will never run out of squad cars, no matter how many you destroy. No one would realistically continue to live in The Precinct’s Averno City by choice – it’s chaos. It’d be like living in the last 15 minutes of The Blues Brothers every hour of every day, as countless squad cars crash through crumbling concrete in their relentless pursuits of the city’s brazen crooks. The cop fiction cliches are certainly all here – you can check off the young, idealistic rookie partnered with a jaded veteran counting the weeks until his retirement, a moustachioed chief, and an officer named Kowalski. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish the script had a bit more of a natural, spoken-word flow to it, though. As it stands it tends to sound a little overwritten and hammy, and some of the voice acting comes over a bit corny as a result. If The Precinct really was a TV show, it unfortunately wouldn’t be in line for any of Hill Street Blues’ 26 Emmys.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cop gear</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately the hokey dialogue does little to detract from what it gets right, and I was very quickly hooked into its cadence of daily shifts on the beat. These can be pounding the pavement on foot, with your eyes peeled for vandals and violence. They can be cruising the streets, prowling for carjackers, or watching for the telltale weaving of a drunk driver. They can even be aerial missions where you’re hovering above the city in a chopper, catching crooks in your spotlight and calling in backup to effect arrests. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a great amount of variety in the types of crimes being committed, which is unfortunate for Averno City’s victimised citizens, but good for us as the emergent missions essentially never stop. I did eventually reach a point where the busts began to feel a little repetitive, but this wasn’t until I was quite close to the end of the roughly 12 hours I spent completing the core story. The procedural street crimes continue after the credits roll, but I suspect I’ll leave The Precinct sweating in the interrogation room for now, and come back to it later if it has anything further to offer me down the track – like fresh cases or different street crimes in a potential future update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action occurs both on foot and in vehicles so, whenever you’re not airborne over the city, a typical shift will involve hoofing it after some suspects before tackling and subduing them – and high-speed, paint-trading car chases to catch others. Those car chases are terrific thanks to The Precinct’s strong handling model. Vehicles may appear cute and toy-like on screen thanks to the elevated, isometric camera angle, but they’re not sticky or twitchy. They have a really well-honed sense of weight as you hurl their all-American bulk into handbrake turns to negotiate corners. When a gaggle of squad cars with sirens blazing close in on a fleeing perp all at once, there are times when The Precinct reminds me more of the original Driver than the old 2D GTA games. (The original Driver as viewed from a low-flying drone, that is.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The range of era-correct lookalike vehicles is spot-on, too, from off-brand Mustangs and ’Cudas, to A-Team-adjacent Vanduras, and the classic, boxy third-gen Caprice cop cars I’ve seen Hollywood crash a thousand of over the years. It’s Detroit steel as far as the eye can see. I love the visual style, with subtle outlines on the vehicles that give them an almost illustrated look. Sirens are especially snazzy at night too, casting a soft blue and red glow on the slick streets. It’s a great looking game overall, and there’s a lot of granular detail that’s been baked into the environment – from heavily vandalised phone booths to the signage for slimy strip clubs. The level of care is admirable considering the distant camera perspective makes it hard to notice these finer touches while bombing through the map in a battered patrol car, but I was able to appreciate them after slowing down to better absorb the surroundings. Regardless of whether I was playing slowly or recklessly, The Precinct ran reliably for me throughout testing with no crashes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>By the book</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Precinct places a clear focus on following correct procedure, and you’ll earn fewer experience points if you make errors or stray from the rules. This will mean levelling up delays and slower access to the upgrade trees if you go rogue and accost people before checking their ID, attack civilians, use inappropriate force on perps, or issue bogus parking tickets. You won’t lose XP from your previously banked total, but being a bad cop will wipe out your daily gains. Most of the upgrades are fairly typical – resilience to attacks, greater ammo capacity, and the like – but naturally it pays to have as many as you can when you find yourself in a shootout. The abilities to call in heavy-duty riot vans and roadblocks are definitely useful in helping end pursuits, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an interesting approach, and it’s one you can go quite deep with if you really want to take control of which individual charges you’re booking your suspects with, and escort them personally to the station (which will earn you more XP). This part of the process can be automated, however, and that’s what I opted to do on almost all occasions, in order to keep things moving along. I’d rather be out on the streets than riding a desk doing paperwork.</p><div id="rank-these-cop-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these cop games</h3><h3>Rank these cop games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, most arrests generally do unfold the same way: you ID your suspect, search them for weapons and contraband, and then arrest them, fine them, or let them go. It’s a system that wears a bit thin by the story’s conclusion because there aren’t enough variables or surprises to separate one from the next. It’s also always a little unsatisfying when it seems to misread the situation, such as when some scumbag is trying to run me over with their car and it scolds me for using my gun to defend myself. I’m a loose cannon, goddamnit! At least let me charge them with trying to kill me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not certain whether this sort of thing is a bug or just something that hasn’t been accounted for, but The Precinct is a little janky overall. I didn’t face any game-breaking issues, but I did encounter the odd gravity-defying fling and unexplained invisible wall that broke the illusion.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The Precinct’s focus on proper arrest protocols and penalising excessive force requires a certain level of patience that not everybody will possess (and it’s a system that eventually wears out its welcome) but I genuinely enjoyed prowling the city for procedural crimes while the story lasted – and the soggy, neon-splashed ’80s setting works wonders. Fallen Tree Games had a previous crack at emulating the top-down shenanigans of classic Grand Theft Auto back with 2019’s American Fugitive, but putting the action on the right side of the law in The Precinct has proven to be far more arresting. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Image credit: Steam / GeoGuessr.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not the only thing bothering GeoGuessr fans, however. If you link your browser GeoGuessr account to your Steam one, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603029962779303287/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>you cannot unlink it</u></a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603030065018615131/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>nor can you log out of the Steam version</u></a>. You cannot play alone, not even to practise and improve. The free amateur mode <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603029755512529810/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seems to be full of bots</u></a> rather than real-life players. And perhaps most surprisingly of all, even if you pay to unlock the features on the browser version, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/geoguessr/comments/1kijyv4/old_pro_subscription_does_not_qualify_as/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this does not carry over to Steam</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its defense, GeoGuessr does make this clear — in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3478870/discussions/0/603025833901182599/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FAQs</u></a>, the developer states "having a GeoGuessr browser subscription does not grant you full access to the GeoGuessr Steam Edition, unless you have an Elite Yearly subscription" — and unlike the browser edition, which requires an annual payment, the Steam Edition Steam Pass is a "one-time purchase giving you access to the full game for the year." It is also clearly marked as an early access title, so it can refine the gameplay, introduce new features, "and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it's clear from both the Steam discussion forums and GeoGuessr's subreddit that the monetization model and lack of features has really taken players by surprise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though sold as free-to-play, GeoGuessr Steam arguably offers less than an hour's free content (that's how long it took us to complete it), hosts just one mode, Duels (wherein you ostensibly face-off against another human player), and lets you play in just one league: Amateur Division. That's it. Without paying for the $2.50 monthly subscription — which does not bill monthly but instead requires a $30 upfront one-off payment — you cannot access higher ranks. There are no other modes at all at this time. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/screenshot-2025-05-13-at-11-59-50-1747134092159.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GeoGuessr's three premium plans for its browser game. Image credit: GeoGuessr.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, GeoGuessr's browser game is not free, either. While you can play three rounds a day for free, to unlock all modes, you need to subscribe to one of three premium tiers: Pro Basic at $2.49 a month, Pro Unlimited's $2.99pm, or Pro Elite's $4.99pm. Only the latter two include free access to the Steam game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an exclusive statement to IGN, GeoGuessr said it was "excited to have a first version of our game available on Steam, something that has been highly requested by our community for a long time." It said that the Steam rollout "align[ed] with its vision of letting everyone explore the world, regardless of their preferred platform," adding: "Bringing the game to Steam offers some great new possibilities, like connecting with Steam friends, enabling additional anti-cheat functionality, and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That anti-cheat functionality is hugely important to the GeoGuessr community, too. The browser game has long been plagued by cheaters using exploits, bots, or good 'ole Google, despite it clearly being against the community rules, so it's possible the developers hopes to lean on Steam's architecture to help combat pervasive cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is a major milestone for us, and also just the beginning," explained head of marketing, Tomas Jonson. "The game is currently in Early Access, and we’re committed to expanding and improving both the free and paid experiences over time. Much of the feedback so far has been around the monetization of the game, with many wishing for a one-time purchase model."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer said that as GeoGuessr relies on data from Google Street View, "where the costs for street view are ongoing and tied to the number of games played," it based the Steam edition "on a model similar to what we use in the browser game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The main exception that the Steam Pass is a non-recurring yearly purchase," Jonson pointed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GeoGuessr suggests the Steam version will be in early access for "at least six months", and it will "introduce new features and ensure the best possible experience with direct feedback from players." It also states on its Steam page that it aims to "expand" the Steam game with "new modes, maps, and competitive features."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We really appreciate the high engagement and all the player feedback we have received so far. We’ll continue listening closely and working with the community as we further develop the Steam Edition," Jonson concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

<p>"To be honest, within the bounds of what I can say, I fully understand your (you guys) request--that's precisely why I had considered taking on this challenge," Harada wrote. "In fact, I had already been thinking about it quite a while ago. Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make contact through several different channels. However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I'm known for revolves around fighting-themed video games.

It's all go on the Illuminate front in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, with the co-op sci-fi shooter's powerful third faction having now set a course for Super Earth - and it's bringing "new terrors" along too.
</p>
<p>
All this arrives as part of Helldivers 2's latest update which - in lore terms at least - sees the squid-like Iluminate emerging from the Meridian singularity in order to bring the never-ending fight for Democracy to Super Earth itself.
</p>
<p>
In more specific terms, that means a wave of brand-new Illuminate enemies. There's the Stingray - jetfighters that unleash devastating strafing runs from above - and the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> in cover".

Worse still are the Fleshmob; failed Illuminate experiments assembled from Voteless parts and let loose on the battlefield. Developer Arrowhead is also teasing "even larger ships", but is leaving players to discover these on their own.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Arrowhead has introduced a new load-out customisation  feature it says will work with "the bulk of" Helldivers 2's weapon offerings. "Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions," it <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/?sf277258176=1">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition."
</p>
<p>
Players can also unlock patterns and apply them to their weapons, and a variety of patterns tied to previous Warbonds - specifically Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds - will be made available on 15th May. That's the same day the new Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives.
</p>
<p>
And finally for Helldivers 2's latest update, item rotation has been removed from the Superstore, meaning players can purchase any item they want anytime they want, no waiting required. It launches today on PS5 and PC.
