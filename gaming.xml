					<p>Coming into Europa, I had no idea what to expect. Indeed, before I mentioned in a chat with other Wccftech folks how I like to cover indies, and I was going to look for one to give a bit of coverage, Europa wasn't even on my longest distance of radars. Unlike the Europa around Jupiter, the Hubble Telescope would have had little chance of picking this up. It would have been a shame, too, because you can tell the passion of developers Novadust Entertainment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Europa is inspired by Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's aesthetically and thematically, which certainly works in the game's favour. This is, without any doubt, a gorgeous game; the environments are splendid to look at, and the art style is similar to that of a watercolour painting. Adding to this is a strong soundtrack, understated when it needs to be and picking up at other moments. For the most part, it complements the game perfectly,&nbsp; with only a few moments when a track draws too much attention to itself (even if the music itself is excellent).</p>
<p>In keeping with the Ghibli theme, Europa's story could be out of a Ghibli movie. I think it would make a better Ghibli movie than a game, if I were honest. Without giving any spoilers away, you are Zee, live on Europa, and are on your way to a giant floating island where the settlers who came from Earth are. What you're doing there, I won't spoil it for you. Why you're going, and the path you're taking is a spoiler.</p>
<p>Well, that, and I'm not entirely sure I understand it. The story is vague, and the ending is wide enough open to fit a whole dreadnought through. The overarching theme is about humanity and not wrecking our environment. Even if we got to Europa or another planet, we would likely only end up wrecking the place like we have Earth.</p>
<p>This is quite hands-off, through quick text and dialogue when you pick up diary pieces. Some questions will naturally flag up as you get to understand a little more of the world. You may wonder why, when attacked by one of the mechanical beasts of the game (the gardeners), it doesn't kill you - and why some of them are simply friendly. You will most certainly wonder what the ending means. I'm not sure if there's a special ending if you collect all 40 gems, but there's a reason I won't find out. Still, I'm not looking to spoil any more of the story. It isn't bad, but a little too vague.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Now, let's get to gameplay. This is where I find Europa has missed its mark a little. The biggest issue of the game is that there is no failure state. The only way you lose is when you're stun-locked by an enemy; you get annoyed enough to throw something at your PC or console and break it. One could say that it is masterful storytelling on the futility of anger, and actions taken out of anger will inevitably only harm the person taking it. One could say that if they weren't talking out of their arse.</p>
<p>So yes, there is no failure state. If you fall off a ledge, you pop back. Take fifty bombs and energy blasts to the face, put a few stars around your head, and walk slowly. You're flying through the sky and hit a mine. There's no problem here; keep flying. The decision genuinely took me out of the game and made a few points tedious rather than engaging. I don't think every game needs combat, and this certainly doesn't need combat - it's part of the theme - but when it gets to the point you can quite literally put the controller down and it's playing itself because there are no consequences, I'm going to do just that.</p>
<p>The same goes with the stun-lock enemies. There was no worry of them hitting me because I couldn't lose or be sent back. The only feeling was annoyance because you could get stun-locked into oblivion with more than one around, slowly trudging to a bit of cover. The only time I ended up going back to Europa wasn't through damage; it's because in one part where the only choice is meant to be "walk forward", I walked backwards and fell through the floor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If there is one other sin Europa commits, it takes away your jetpack (It's called something else, but it's a jetpack, so I'm calling it that). I'm sorry, but when you give me a jetpack and some of the most gorgeous vistas I've seen in at least twenty minutes, I want to fly around them. Even though I knew there was nothing to do - not a criticism, sometimes just exploring a lovely painting is enough - I was looking around. There are 40 gems to collect around the game levels, and you can also collect other gems which increase your jetpack's fuel.</p>
<p>Far too often, Europa has flying fish that zap your fuel. Or you'll get to the determined "you must do some platforming" or "here's a simple puzzle" section, and boom - pink crystals or force fields zap your fuel. The fish are the worst because they're often in an area where you can refuel if you trudge for around twenty seconds. It never added challenge, it just annoyed. It's particularly annoying because going around on the jetpack was <em>fun</em>. I smiled, simply flopping around, aiming for the little blue circles to refuel mid-flight and taking in gorgeous sights while hunting for the few collectables and exploring every cranny to ensure I hadn't missed something.</p>
<p>When the fish and crystals stopped this, and the annoying stun-locking started, I decided, "No, I'm not exploring any more; it's time just to finish the game", and I started just pushing through levels, start to finish. Maybe there's a secret ending if I collect all 40 gems, but the annoyances later mean I don't care. I can't help but think I would have adored this if they had toned that back just a little so it didn't kill the exploratory, harm-free game they put forward.</p>
<p>What makes it more annoying is that the puzzles and platforming it kills your jetpack for are basic at best and, due to the lack of failure state, offer nothing to the game. I don't feel like I need to solve them; they're just something put in my way to grind the fun and story to a halt. There's no real narrative explanation either, unlike the blast monsters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's something almost meditative about the best parts of Europa. It's reminiscent of Flower, which concerns me when I realise I bought it on the PlayStation 3 fifteen years ago. I'm getting old. Though yes, the style of movement with your jetpack, the gorgeous vistas, and the way the story is told against what is an idyllic backdrop, Europa has a lot to offer and a lot to say about itself. Still, I don't doubt some flow-destroying missteps will irritate others as they have me.</p>

<p>Europa looks to offer a meditative experience, as you explore gorgeous vistas backed up by an outstanding soundtrack, and it can offer this, only it is piecemeal. Far too often it trips itself up by killing the traversal and exploration, and throwing things at you that are never challenging, and only annoying, </p>

			<p>At CitizenCon 2024, Cloud Imperium Games has shared a new hour-long gameplay demo of Squadron 42, the story based single player game set in Star Citizen's universe. They also finally announced the release window: 2026. This gives credence to <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henderson's repor</a>t, which mentioned the game only reached feature complete status recently, as opposed to the developer's claim <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in October 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The presentation wasn't without issues between crashes and frame drops, making it clear why CIG still needs a couple of years before releasing Squadron 42. On the CitizenCon stage, Chris Roberts shared an estimate on the campaign's length: between thirty and forty hours.</p>
<p>In the narrative, players will step into the shoes of a rookie pilot of the UEE (United Empire of Earth) who gets assigned to the Navy's notorious 42nd Squadron. The plot begins in 2945, with the Vanduul raid on Vega II.</p>

The demo was heavy on flashy cutscenes with CGI representations of Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong, mixed with on-rails turret action in a huge space battle. The demo ended with a first-person shooter segment as the alien enemy boarded the player’s ship.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/19/screenshot-2024-10-19-193434-1729363460625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Chris Roberts on-stage at CitizenCon.

But there’s a lot more in the game than we were just showing there. It’s also been a lot more stable for me when I’ve been playing these last few weeks.”</p><p>Roberts continued: “As I said at the start, we have 30 to 40 hours of gameplay. We feel confident we can bring the quality of the game up to the level we've just shown and more, without crashes. Both the team and I are confident of giving you this game in 2026. Obviously you can see it’s not going to be tomorrow, because you saw a few crashes there.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gladiator has three minutes of battle and eight minutes of prologue.

Gladiator has three minutes of battle and eight minutes of prologue. This was an hour of crazy stuff.</p><p>“But thank you for allowing us to build something so amazing, and I can’t wait for you all to be able to play it in the moderate future.”</p><p>Star Citizen is considered one of the most controversial projects in all video games.

The developer makes revenue publicly available on its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, which at the time of this article’s publication shows Star Citizen has raised $729,151,801.

<p>The Call of Duty League is shaping up for another season, and like every year, the buzz is now around where the major tournaments will be held. In a string of posts on social media, it was claimed that the first tournament – a CDL Major – will take place in Barcelona in early February, marking the first time in many years that a Call of Duty League Major has been held in a European city.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-in-barca">Black Ops in Barca</h2>



<p>It was claimed by <a href="https://x.com/_TheRotation/status/1847706695600066729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Rotation on Twitter</a> that the CDL’s 2025 season, which will be played out on Black Ops 6, will kick off in Barcelona. This will be the site of Major I, and as the year unravels, we’ll see other Major tournaments take place in Toronto, Miami, and Dallas.</p>



<p>It was also claimed that there will be a fifth Major in 2025, potentially being hosted in Chicago.</p>



<p>There’s no indication of where 2025’s COD Champs tournament will be held.</p>



<p>This year’s Call of Duty League only had four Majors and was wrapped up by late July, leaving a gulf of a gap between that season and the next. If Major I doesn’t occur until early February, it’ll be a whopping six months between seasons, which is one of the immense sticking points with the Call of Duty competitive community.</p>



<p>The CDL returning to Europe for a Major is a monumental thing, though. Barcelona is a strange spot, but many fans will be overjoyed to see it returning to the EU region after several years of being ‘locked out’ of the CDL action. I for one will be on site reporting everything as it unfolds, if that’s the case.</p>



<p>What are your expectations for the CDL 2025 season? Do you hope we get a Major tournament in Europe? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Squadron 42 has received a 2026 release date at this year’s Citizencon and has been confirmed to have 30-40 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>The announcement came following a demo of Squadron 42 at Citizencon, which showcased the game’s first chapter in spectacular fashion, featuring a prologue of a space battle that introduces players to the universe.</p>



<p>The demo wasn’t without its hiccups, though. Two game crashes occurred throughout the presentation, played live on stage. The second crash was comically blamed on the computer rather than the game’s unstable nature.</p>



<p>After the demo presentation, Chris Roberts went on stage to reiterate that the game has approximately 30-40 hours of gameplay and that the team is “confident” in its 2026 release window. </p>



<p>It’s no secret that Cloud Imperium Games tends to miss its scheduled release dates, so whether they can stick to that release date remains to be seen. Earlier this week, Insider Gaming reported some of the issues that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Imperium Games has faced with its development timelines</a>. </p>



<p><span>Squadron </span>42 was announced on October 10th, 2012, together with&nbsp;Star Citizen&nbsp;and the launch of its crowdfunding campaign. According to its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, Squadron 42 and Star Citizen have raised $729 million as of this writing.</p>

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong has been a huge success, and those who had access to a PlayStation 5 or PC were able to play the hit game. In previous reports, Black Myth: Wukong was known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoos-august-2024-report-reveals-black-myth-wukong-top-grossing-game-across-six-markets/">top-grossing game across six markets</a> and is set to be getting a DLC, which is slated for early 2025. However, a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40203/black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rating on ESRB</a> has appeared for the Xbox version of the game. Of course, this isn't an absolute confirmation that the game will be coming to Xbox soon, but it's a pretty good sign.</p>
<p>The ESRB is the rating board in North America, and thus far, there haven't been any ratings from other regulatory bodies, such as Europe's PEGI rating board. It isn't a secret that Black Myth: Wukong was going to be released on Xbox. When the game was showcased at Summer Game Fest 2024, it was announced by the developers that there would be a delay for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game. With that announcement came a lot of speculation about whether or not the game was a console exclusive to PlayStation, but it was then confirmed that the reason there was<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/"> a delay</a> was because there was a memory leak. The information given to the audience about why the delays were happening was quite vague, with Microsoft declining to provide much information about the situation.</p>
<p>With the rating by the ESRB, it's possible that the Xbox port of Black Myth: Wukong is closer than the audience originally thought. The title is already incredibly successful, with the game selling over 18 million units. By releasing the game on another platform and allowing more players to access it, it has the potential to sell a couple million more copies. It's unlikely it'll sell the amount it's currently sold on PlayStation and PC, as Xbox seems to be the less commonly chosen platform. However, if the game is opened up to players via Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, the game has the potential to get a second resurgence when it releases on Xbox.</p>
<p>For now, we will have to wait and see if the developers announce the upcoming release of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S or if it was a false alarm. It's possible that we'll see the PEGI rating board also rate the game if its to be released on Xbox soon.</p>
<p>Do you think the game will be released on Xbox this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>One of the fastest-selling games of all time, Black Myth: Wukong, could be headed to Xbox Series XS soon. That suggestion comes following a rating for an Xbox version of the game, published recently by the ESRB, the rating board in North America. It’s only a slight nod, but the ESRB is generally a solid enough source for things like this.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that other regulatory bodies, such as Europe’s PEGI board, haven’t yet rated an Xbox version of the Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers-again">Big Numbers, Again</h2>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is one of the best-selling games of 2024. It was recently revealed that the title sold 20 million units in just a few weeks on the market and that in September, the game had earned more than $1 billion in gross revenue across Steam <strong>alone</strong>.</p>



<p>It was released on August 20, and by August 23, it had sold 10 million copies worldwide, most of which were shipped in China, which is where the game was created.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40203/black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update to the ESRB rating</a> for Black Myth: Wukong, a reference to ‘Xbox Series’ joined PlayStation 5 and PC, which could suggest that the game is finally heading to the Xbox platform. Weeks ago, it was being widely debated <strong>why </strong>Game Science, the title’s developer, hadn’t released the game on Xbox, and everything from incompatibility to secret exclusivity deals was floated.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/">as far back as June</a>, Microsoft’s representatives were talking about the anticipation of Black Myth: Wukong coming to Xbox. It was a matter of time back then, and it might not be long now until we hear about an announcement.</p>



<p>Will Black Myth: Wukong shift another 10 million copies on Xbox? Let us know what you think on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-foundry-posts-more-the-last-of-us-part-2-ps4-pro-capture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Earlier this month, Digital Foundry had the opportunity to go hands-on with PlayStation 5 Pro at Sony's London office, walking away with high quality capture from The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart. You've already seen our analysis pieces on how each of those games compares on Pro against the standard model, along with a breakdown of PSSR upscaling quality up against DLSS and FSR. However, one piece of feedback we received loud and clear was the demand just to see more of the games running, without any of our customary head-to-head comparisons.</p>
<p>All of which leads us to this Eurogamer news post, where we deliver just that - starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s PS5 Pro PSSR upgrade for The Last of Us Part 2. If you recall, the Pro enhancements here are all about upscaling with the simple TAA upscale swapped out for Sony's brand new machine learning-based counterpart. The base resolution of 1440p remains unchanged from the standard PS5, but PSSR offers substantial image quality improvements - as you may pick up on with this more extended video edit that focuses much more on the overall presentation.</p>

<p>In addition to the capture, you'll get to hear myself and Oliver Mackenzie recap our overall impressions (both of us have played the Pro version at this point), plus there's more general discussion about the opportunities we've had with the game and with the Pro in general.</p><p>Typically, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dfclipschannel">DF Clips</a> aims to cut down our lengthy DF Direct weekly show into its component modules for easier consumption, but we also post exclusive content from time to time and with a lot of PS5 Pro capture now in our possession - and often not ending up on the main channel at all - it's a good home for a bit of bonus material, so please do consider subscribing!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-call-of-duty-black-ops-maps-according-to-the-devs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We all have our favorite Call of Duty multiplayer map, but which Black Ops multiplayer map do the developers of the game keep returning to in their spare time? IGN sat down with senior Call of Duty Black Ops developers, many of whom actually created some of the most popular Call of Duty maps of all time, to answer once and for all which multiplayers maps truly are the best.</p><p>Just a note before we begin, this list will only cover multiplayer maps that have appeared in the Black Ops series, meaning you won’t be finding maps that appeared in the Modern Warfare games. Apologies to fans of Crash.</p><h3>Nuketown (Call of Duty: Black Ops)</h3><p>No list of Black Ops multiplayer maps can exist without Nuketown. Perhaps one of the most popular multiplayer maps in the entire Call of Duty franchise, this desolate test site for nuclear missile testing first appeared in the first Call of Duty: Black Ops. Since then, some version of the map has appeared in every Call of Duty Black Ops game ever since, speaking to its status as a perennial favorite. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On creating the map that started it all, expert level designer Adam Hoggatt says he has more fond memories of making the map than actually playing it, saying it wasn’t an idea that was pushed forward by the studio, but instead a passion project that was started up for fun. From there it just snowballed into what is now Nuketown: “We all just put all the most fun things we could think of into the map. There’s the doomsday clock, an engineer helped hook up the first mannequin Easter Egg, and the audio department said, ‘Hey, we have this Rolling Stones song that we licensed and don’t have anywhere to use it,”’ so we put that in there. The rest is pretty much history.”</p><h3>Raid (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2)</h3><p>Another popular map as chosen by the developers is Raid. Set in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, the map is a sniper's paradise and perfect for long-range weapons. Regarding its development, Hoggatt calls it almost the opposite of Nuketown because unlike the natural creative process behind Nuketown, Raid “started off a little bit rough.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-2-raid-1729172496179.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“It actually went through several complete redesigns,” he says. “But each time we iterated, something interesting from the previous iteration was carried over into the new one,” resulting in the fan favorite map.</p><h3>Carrier (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2)</h3><p>Set atop a large military aircraft carrier, the appropriately named Carrier is associate creative director Miles Leslie’s favorite map, which is high praise considering he says he “literally worked on every single multiplayer map since World at War.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Carrier is very much a different beast than Raid, with obstacles scattered across the deck preventing most long-range combat. Instead, close-quarter combat is required, and players will usually come out of the map with a large killstreak if they’re skilled enough.</p><p>“We knew going in it was going to be a super tough design because no one would ever make a multiplayer map on top of a Carrier,” says Leslie, “Because it’s flat.” But like Raid, Carrier underwent numerous iterations and ideas before finding its final form. One unused idea according to Leslie was that players could hop into a plane and use it to fire missiles. Sad we missed out on that one.</p><h3>Kowloon (Call of Duty: Black Ops)</h3><p>Another of Leslie’s favorite maps is Kowloon from the first Call of Duty: Black Ops. Inspired by what the single-player team was doing with the famous Hong Kong walled city, Leslie says Kowloon was another fun map to design because of the challenge it posed the development team. “If you look at the real Kowloon, the buildings are separated. How can you have a separated giant hole in the center of a multiplayer map?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The solution was introducing the first zip lines in a multiplayer map ever, solving the layout issue and creating a crazy fun map to zip around in the process.</p><h3>Evac (Call of Duty: Black Ops 3)</h3><p>Not a map that’s often thrown around when discussing best multiplayer maps in Call of Duty, Evac is a personal favorite of Leslie’s thanks to how it incorporates Call of Duty’s advanced movement system.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-3-evac-1729172612021.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Set in an abandoned evacuation zone on top of a flooded quarantine zone in Singapore, Evac is a “playground of fun” according to Leslie, who recalls how he and the team spent countless hours playtesting the map and immediately adding any fun idea they had into the finished product: A map where players can combo wall jumps and runs together into an exciting, parkour-heavy multiplayer map.</p><h3>Deprogram (Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War)</h3><p>One of the newer maps on the list, lead game designer Joanna Leung says her favorite multiplayer map is Deprogram from Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Set inside the fragmented mind of Adler, this small map is primarily for close-quarters combat, though there are fun secret areas perfect for snipers if you can find them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/cold-war-deprogram-1729172820072.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“I’m a SMG player at heart and I love getting up close and personal with my enemies while I kill them… So I love that map for that reason,” says Leung.</p><h3>Standoff (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2)</h3><p>True to its name, Standoff from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is a map where two sides face-off to see who controls the center of the map. With snipers on either side, there’s not a lot of safe spaces in this map, which was inspired by a small border town between China and Kyrgyzstan. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-2-standoff-1729172839620.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But if you’re able to find your way through the small flanking routes in the side, you’ll find that you can get the drop on snipers and take them out. “It’s such a satisfying experience because I now get a leg up on those guys who kept sniping at me, and basically attack them from behind.”</p><h3>Cracked (Call of Duty: Black Ops)</h3><p>One of the bigger maps in rotation, Cracked lent itself to the larger-than-life feel and big-scale action that Call of Duty is known for. It’s also the favorite map of Raven Software lead designer Damon Shubhastari.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-cracked-1729172468932.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“There was just a lot of internal playtests with Cracked that I felt like I had so much playing, especially when the RC XD came online. Cracked was just a very intense map, especially in Domination.”</p><h3>Firing Range (Call of Duty: Black Ops)</h3><p>Many popular maps get reimagined or remastered in later Black Ops games. For example, there’s Firing Range which was originally imagined as a military training facility before getting reskinned as a Hollywood backlot set, a change that Shubhastari particularly enjoyed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“The fun was already there, in the map, we knew it. It was a classic fan favorite, but when the team remodeled [Firing Range] as a studio backlot I just thought it was super fun to play.”</p><h3>Satellite (Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War)</h3><p>Another recent map from Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Satellite is one of Matt Coutras’ favorite maps. A senior level designer at Treyarch, Coutras’ favorite map is actually Raid, but Satellite is another of his top hits considering he was involved with designing the map from start to finish.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-satellite-1729173068570.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One goal for Coutras with Satellite was to lean into the natural King of the Hill type gameplay of the map. “I tried to make it so all different types of gameplay styles could be used on that map. So if you want to snipe, you could go out to the dunes. If you wanted to run and gun with a shotgun or an SMG, you could go right down the dry riverbed and try to flank around to get upon top of the hill with a satellite.”</p><h3>The Pines (Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War)</h3><p>Another Cold War map, The Pines is set in a fictional New Jersey mall that was going to have its grand opening before being taken over by Perseus. The mix of suburban America and military gunfights is reminiscent of the classic film Red Dawn, and is another of Coutras’ favorite maps purely for nostalgia.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-the-pines-1729173100799.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“It reminds me of the mall where I grew up on the East coast and it has an interesting design choice,” he says. “In the center of the map you have the high side versus the low side and it makes for some really interesting engagements.”</p><h3>Express (Call of Duty: Black Ops 2)</h3><p>Based on a currently non-existent, California High-Speed Rail terminal, Express takes the classic three-lane map structure and dials up the intensity and fun, according to Jake Harley, associate lead audio designer at Raven Software.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/17/black-ops-2-express-1729173211843.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“It’s a twist on traditional three lane map design where there are the parts that you could walk up and over on the stairs to over the train, as well as some sections on the side of the map that would go down into the terminal area.”</p><p>Those are the favorite Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer maps according to the developers. Let us know what your favorite Call of Duty Black Ops maps are in the comments.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Turtle Beach are becoming the one-stop shop for peripherals right now. While they’ve built their own legacy over the years, they’re now also buying up other manufacturers like PDP, with brands like Victrix and Roccat all now falling under the same umbrella. While expansion is the key here, they’ve not forgotten what they built the brand on originally, and with the Stealth 500 they’re setting out their stall for this year’s gaming audio crown. They might just win it too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stealth 500 Xbox Product Video | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvmGAtWxPx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In recent years, the Stealth headset lineup has iterated, rather than reinvented. The general form and design stayed the same for years, while they steadily updated batteries and connectivity. Not so with this year’s release, as the all-new Stealth 500 boasts a complete redesign, bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>


<p>Now, the old Stealth headsets weren’t ugly per se, but they were definitely showing their age. The first thing you’ll notice with the new Stealth 500 is how sleek and modern it looks, fashioned wholly out of black materials, it is almost as stealthy as its name implies. The build is mostly plastic, with a rigid plastic headband, but it has the added benefit of making this one very light headset. I’ve worn this thing for whole days and never had a moment of weariness, and that’s a huge boon if you live with your headset on.</p>
<p>One of the new features for Turtle Beach is a floating headband. Taking a swift glance over at Steelseries’ homework, they’ve decided this is the best way to do headbands, and frankly, I’d have to agree. It conforms to your head shape, you can barely tell it’s there, and there are three settings to adjust it for different sized heads. It’s absolutely spot on.</p>

<p>There’s a host of controls on the left earpiece, with a master volume dial and a chat volume one below it. These are slightly plasticky, but they’re not too cheap-feeling. You’ve then got a USB-C port for charging, and a series of buttons, letting you access power, Bluetooth and Mode settings without any issues.</p>
<p>You can connect via the 2.4Ghz wireless dongle – still USB-A if you were wondering – or over Bluetooth. Our version was branded as being for PlayStation, but it also played happily with my PC, Nintendo Switch and my Samsung Z Flip 6. For most people, it’ll slot easily into your setup.</p>
<p>You’ve got an easy level of control via the Swarm II app, available on both desktop and mobile. This handles all your firmware updates – it’s likely the first thing it’ll do when you hook it all up – as well as letting you customise your EQ settings and various other features. It’s mostly seamless and straightforward (though the updating process threw up a few errors along the way), and given that you’re unlikely to be more than a few feet from your mobile at any one time, it just adds to the ease of use.</p>
<p>As standard there are four EQ settings, but you can create you own profiles as well, utilising a 10-band EQ to get things sounding exactly the way you want them. I normally like the Turtle Beach Signature Sound, but here it felt a little muddy and lacking definition, but I was soon able to dial in more top end to bring out the detail. This was more apparent when listening to music via mobile than while gaming on PS5, and it feels as though the Stealth 500 loses a little definition over Bluetooth that isn’t the case via the wireless connection. Still, you can definitely remedy it via the EQ.</p>

<p>The Swarm II app also give you detailed control over the microphone setup, including noise gate and mic monitoring. The mic itself swings down from the main body of the left earpiece – retaining an old Stealth design aspect – and it angles slightly towards your mouth, though without any ability to further customise its position. It definitely does the job during online play, though it’s not as precise as the microphones you’ll find on more expensive headsets.</p>
<p>Gaming is of course the primary order of the day though, and Star Wars Outlaws sounded utterly fantastic via the Stealth 500, with the soundtrack swelling powerfully at the right moments, while there was more than enough detail for the stellar voice acting to cut through. Hopping back into Overwatch 2, the 40mm drivers did an excellent job of delivering other player’s positions to me, and the familiar push and pull of the gameplay was given a nice spark by the Stealth 500’s audio delivery.</p>
<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is priced at £79.99, putting it primarily up against Sony’s Pulse 3D and Microsoft’s own Wireless Headset – this has been out of stock for a while, so a refresh might be coming. It benefits over Sony’s offering by including Bluetooth, and some might prefer the more standard styling. I’m a big fan of the Microsoft Wireless Headset, but the Stealth 500 pips it for comfort, thanks to its floating headband.</p>
