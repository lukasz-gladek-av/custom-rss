<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-rpg-game-of-2025-nominations">Best RPG Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors. Its battle-to-battle scenarios and set-pieces are determined by your team and your build: How you invest skill points, your ability to attack an enemy’s weakness, and so forth. It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>



<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>



<p>It’s your chance to go to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to tell everyone your favorite RPG game of 2025. You can also admonish us for not giving it to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!</p>

I fear not enough people have played it, and if you haven't, you should change that.</p><hr><p><em>As the year comes to a close, we're highlighting some personal favorite games from our team that we feel you shouldn't miss.

Fortunately, her computer brain can be implanted over and over again into cybernetic android bodies, which are equipped with grapples, jetpacks, and limbs that allow Aska to dash and wall-run through any environment. Oh, and it lets Aska carry seven guns, ranging from sniper rifles to shotguns and more, that she deftly uses to mow down anything and anyone in her way. Her journey to defeat Moebius's massive Engineers, which hold the Cores she desperately needs to save the city, will take you through derelict factories, deserts, mining facilities, and into myriad arenas for some of the best first-person gunplay of 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metal Eden wears its Doom Eternal inspiration on its sleeve, turning wave-based arenas into coliseums of destruction, lest you stop moving. Using her jetpack, turbo boosts, ammo, armor, and health pickups scattered around the arena, you'll need to hold your breath and shoot everything in the room – it all wants to kill you, after all. Pause for a second, and it could spell certain doom. The resulting combat experience is a fast-paced, kinetic, on-the-go shooting gallery that I promise will send adrenaline surging through your veins.&nbsp;</p><p>That high-speed gunplay elasticity carries over into the Ghostrunner-like runs in between arenas, which task you with keeping momentum as you sprint on walls, grapple up to platforms, and jetpack double jump to safety, all while shooting down enemies that threaten your existence. The reward at the end of a linear run through Moebius' various locales is one of the aforementioned arenas, the perfect zones to try out your latest weapon upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>There's more to Metal Eden, like some Metroid Prime-inspired sections and a voice-in-your-comms that's a bit too present, but ultimately, everything that happens when you aren't pulling the trigger gets in the way. Fortunately, these sections aren't as frequent as the parts of Metal Eden that shine, so rest assured, there's an excellent shootout just minutes away when things feel slow.&nbsp;</p><p>For more of my thoughts, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metal-eden/shooting-through-the-noise">read my Metal Eden review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/25/why-you-should-play-metal-eden]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/stray-children</link>
            <guid>1392160</guid>

<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161281/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stray Children launched on the Japanese eShop on 26th December 2024. We weren't able to review it back in October when it arrived in the West, but we've now managed to catch up with Onion Games' latest...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Your dad’s missing and some weird “uncle” is at the door, claiming to know you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a> just chucks you straight into things with barely a title screen – but perhaps that sort of stylistic confidence is unsurprising coming from people behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. Yoshihiro Kimura and Onion Games have delivered a compact, auteur-driven project, heading off on adventures into emotional storytelling rather than into sophisticated mechanics. And it uncovers some impressive treasures on its quest.</p>
<p>The story we’re told is that of a dog-faced kid venturing into a fantasy world through the screen of a video game. That world is surreal, funny, and sometimes very dark. In contrast to this unsettling tone, the graphics present charming, cute pixels, with a colour palette stirring memories of the Game Boy Advance. That soft presentation is the lens to show rather strange and uncomfortable things: <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong> orphans in a prison, for example, or a stalking frog paparazzo.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161280/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game takes its unexplained opening and runs with it, shunning straightforward exposition and trading instead on feelings and vague impressions. Nonetheless, the gist of it is that you are trapped in a trippy, sinister world populated by children who are abandoned and lost.</p>
<p>It is the world of a video game, and its heroic knight has been destroyed – your task is to put it back together. The children, meanwhile, are lacking clear figures of authority, yet subject to judgement, labelled “bad” and punished. You explore from a top-down perspective in the 16-bit style, talking to myriad inhabitants of this endlessly off-kilter world.</p>
<p>The themes of parental authority and a child’s perspective are taken further by the enemies in the lands you explore. You will face random encounters with the “Olders” – creatures based on adults, themselves failing to cope with hang-ups and demons. They inflict suffering and strict expectations while wrestling their own internal frustrations.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161277/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In practice, this is represented by bullet-hell-style attacks dealt out in a turn-based structure. Kimura was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is no bad thing. The Olders can be defeated by attacking on your turn, which requires you to stop a spinning arrow on a segment of a circle. The size of the segment, its position, and the number of rotations you’re allowed before you have to press all get changed up. However, it’s not exactly the deepest mechanic – that’s just not what the game’s going for.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting, the Olders can instead be talked down from their fixations and freed, excluding them from further random encounters. This talking mechanic is a continuation of the inscrutable approach Onion Games has taken to the game. Various speech options need to be selected in the right order during combat, taking one turn per option, and resetting when mistakes are made.</p>
<p>Finding out the right order for your statements, however, is mysterious in the extreme. It’s very easy to miss out completely on freeing the Olders, and even the ones you get will still require some guesswork. Later, tougher bosses make trial and error pretty severe, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161278/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That experience of talking to the Olders is emblematic of the game’s general attitude to you as you play. There is plenty of friction here, but it’s so consistent from minute one that it’s clearly intentional. Experiencing the world as something confusing and unexplained — inexplicable perhaps — is alienating but childlike. This hammers home what the game’s about, but it doesn’t always feel good to engage with. There’s a tension between delivering on the theme and being fun to play, but that just makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>One thing that consistently delights, however, is the sound. The music sits perfectly with the game’s surreal world and its colours, which seem at once washed out and oversaturated. Eerie woodwinds, for example, make the perfect theme tune for tailing pigs along a train track, something like 2000s J-pop accompanies a lily pad gliding minigame, and a trilling harpsichord leads you around a grand palace.</p>
<p>The stand-out feature of the sound effects, meanwhile, has to be the character voices. These sit somewhere between the apparent sentences of Simlish and the one-dimensional jibber-jabber of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a>. They are clearly somehow composed from different languages, with some distinctly German snowmen being particularly memorable.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161286/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite some frustrating repetition (unskippable dialogue right between a save point and a boss fight? Check!), Stray Children is not overlong, clocking in at about 12-15 hours. A lot of my time was spent wandering, searching for hidden items in every nook and cranny, and talking to every character I saw – sometimes a requirement for progression.</p>
<p>Again, though, the game gets away with the friction: the disorientation and lack of comfort create a sense of vulnerability – of being a stray. No doubt some players will find this opacity all a bit much. But for those feeling patient and intrigued by the art style and storytelling, it’s a joyful thing to play overall.</p>
<p>While I was in the latter camp — loving the surreal world despite the challenges — I was definitely grateful for the pick-up-and-play nature of the Switch. The pixel art looks great on the small screen, too. The hybrid console is still the best way to play the right kind of games, and this is one of them.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stray Children is nothing if not opinionated. From its abrupt opening to its inscrutable mechanics, it outright refuses to hold your hand. This clarity of purpose builds a world that is totally captivating – <em>if</em> it gets its hooks into you.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time and patience to explore and experiment while being labelled a “bad child”, this may not be for you. However, if you’re game for some surreal challenges, this is a memorable and ultimately optimistic adventure.</p></section>

<p>The holidays have finally kicked in, and players are ready to kick back and relax while trying some new games, warming up with a nice cup of hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this holiday season, you might be thinking of introducing one of your non-gamer friends or family members to the world of gaming. There are some great picks out there where you can experience a whole new world along with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;This Insider Gaming guide will help you pick the best game to play with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games and hardware across all platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-two">It Takes Two</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Starting with the game of the year for 2021, It Takes Two is a brilliant co-op game that will really get your non-gamer friend interested in this field of entertainment. It Takes Two has players exploring a couple’s clashes and how they make up while being turned into dolls and overcoming a series of obstacles. Each level features unique, interconnected abilities that must be used in coordination to get ahead. &nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Split Fiction is the latest title from the same people who introduced us to It Takes Two, but it’s a lot more recent and a great pick for non-gamers. The narrative follows two writers who are stuck in their own stories, trapped by a force trying to steal their creative ideas. One world is sci-fi, and the other is fantasy, and the things you will experience in this game are unlike any other.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-way-out">A Way Out</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Next, we have A Way Out, a premise that should interest a non-gamer friend who’s into prison escape movies. That’s right, in this title, you have to work in tandem with your friend to plan and execute a prison escape. There will be a variety of puzzles and obstacles to overcome through coordination and teamwork across areas that you would only have seen in the movies. Will you be able to break free?&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The latest instalment to the iconic kart racing franchise is Mario Kart World, and it’s exclusively available on the Switch 2. Mario Kart World is a great introductory game for a non-gamer; some competitive fun across various levels is always fun. Moreover, the new entry introduces free exploration, increased 24-player lobbies, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-nbsp">LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>LEGO games are always good titles to get non-gamers inducted into gaming, and Marvel Super Heroes 2 helps if your friend is a fan of the MCU. Players can play as iconic heroes and superheroes from the Marvel universe from different eras and realities as you go head-to-head with the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror. Explore an expansive open world with areas inspired by Ancient Egypt to The Old West, Sakaar, and New York City in 2099, all built in LEGO.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If your non-gamer is not a friend of Marvel, then Star Wars could be their thing. The Skywalker Saga lets you experience all nine films reimagined with LEGO humour and enables you to play the three trilogies in any order you want. There are over 300 characters to play as from this highly popular franchise, more than 100 vehicles, and 23 planets that you can spend time exploring.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another way to get your non-gamer into gaming is to try out some sports titles. FC 26 is one of the most popular sports titles, with football being one of the biggest sports. FC 26 is wildly popular for its co-op play, and players can choose their favourite teams and try out a variety of game modes that suit their preferences.&nbsp;The series has also made some significant improvements over the last title, including more responsive dribbling, smarter AI positioning, sharper, more explosive movement, and much more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If football isn’t your jam, then basketball might be a sport that your non-gamer friend is more inclined towards. The new instalment uses technology that “directly translates NBA footage into realistic gameplay.” NBA 2K26 also features a wide variety of teams and game modes you can choose from, either fight it out in an arena, or take it to the streets. The new title also makes you feel more connected to every dribble and crossover with revamped size-ups and experience fast-paced, dynamic movement with all-new ProPLAY features.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE is an iconic franchise that almost everyone, gamer or non-gamer, has heard of. It’s a familiar, entertaining world where players have spent hours on end performing special moves in real life, and it’s never too late to get into it. There are a variety of modes that players can try out, play with, or against their non-gamer friends, and choose from one of the most prominent entertainment personalities from this world.</p>







<hr>

<p>I suspect many of my fellow parents can relate to this, but when you have your first child, a whole bevvy of problems that never existed before are suddenly thrust upon you.</p>

<p>Granted, a lot of these aren’t necessarily ‘problems’ as such, rather minor inconveniences that, along with frequent moments of unbridled joy, make up the weird and wonderful world of parenthood. I do, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Nintendo, specifically with its approach to game difficulty in the last mainline Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Before having a child, the idea of lowering a game’s difficulty had honestly never really entered my mind. If anything, I would crank the difficulty up wherever I could in the hope that it would both extend my overall playtime and provide a unique sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a> on Legendary? No problem. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> on Climax? Is that all you've got?</p>
<p>This all changed, however, when my daughter expressed interest in playing Mario Wonder. She watched the <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and became somewhat obsessed with the characters – especially Princess Peach. She’s only three, so I knew immediately that if I’m going to let her play, I’d need to make sure it was as approachable as possible, despite my own proclivities.</p>
<p>As you might know, however, Super Mario Bros. Wonder essentially locks its lower difficulty setting to specific characters: Nabbit and four Yoshis. So when the character select screen came up, I gently tried to explain this to my daughter, knowing full well how the conversation would go.</p>
<p><em>“Now listen, if you go for one of <strong>these</strong> characters, the game will be a bit easier for you and you’ll have a lot more fun.”<br></em><em>“I want to be Princess Peach thoooough!”<br></em><em>“That might be a bit trickier. If you go for the purple rabbit, it’ll be better.”<br></em><em>“No, Princess Peach!”</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="d3b1fe9bd18f7"><a title="SSMBW - Nabbit 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3b1fe9bd18f7/ssmbw-nabbit-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"You'll play as Nabbit and you'll LIKE IT!"</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> Anyone who’s had the pleasure of raising a three-year-old knows that it’s borderline impossible to change their mind once their heart is set on something. In this case, Princess Peach is my daughter’s favourite character from the movie, so <em>of course</em> she’s going to want to play as her. This meant we'd have to do without the perks – including <em>invincibility</em> – that come with Yoshi or Nabbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did it go? Well, rather predictably, not well. The opening stage – Welcome to the Flower Kingdom – was doable, but it went rapidly downhill from there. I knew that changing to Yoshi or Nabbit wasn’t suddenly going to make the game a cakewalk; after all, while both characters boast unique abilities that would theoretically make most scenarios easier, there’s still the task of actually navigating the levels. Given my daughter’s age and inexperience, even that would no doubt prove quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Still, it seems baffling to me that Nintendo would create a game aimed at children and families and not offer any optional difficulty settings for the majority of its 12 playable characters. No offence to Nabbit, but no child wants to play him when the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are sitting right there; especially when the Illumination movie had such an immediate, profound influence on my daughter's perception and preferences.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options, in my eyes.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I managed to convince her so she could enjoy the game, but she was exceptionally stubborn in her desire to play as Peach. And honestly? I'm quite proud of that. It makes me think that perhaps, way off in the future, she'll be playing her games on higher difficulties just like me... Or she just loves Peach and wants to play as her – yeah, that's probably it. In the end, though, she gave up and went back to playing with her Peach plushie.</p>
<figure data-uuid="585a5d013f786"><a title="SMBW - Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585a5d013f786/smbw-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah... She never got this far.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> have proven that even the most challenging of experiences can be accessible to almost anybody when it has the right options in place. Quite frankly, I think with invincibility turned on and unlimited stamina applied, my daughter could probably have more fun with Celeste than she did with Mario Wonder – and I consider the latter to be <em>much</em> easier on its default settings.</p>
<p>So come on, sort it out, Nintendo. You've made some strides with difficulty and accessibility options over the years, but you've clearly got a long way to go. Applying blanket difficulty settings to a tentpole Mario title seems like the most basic of tasks when your goal is to reach as many potential players as possible, but as ever, the company stubbornly does things its own way.</p>
<p>Forcing those who want a breezier time to play as a specific character, though..? Nah, that ain't it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 was a solid year</a> for <strong>shooter games</strong> thanks to releases like Helldivers 2, Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and Marvel Rivals, but 2025 can be argued to be even superior now that the calendar is wrapping up.</p>



<p>From medieval melee-infused demon slaying to post-apocalyptic extraction PvPvE mayhem, the shooter landscape has thrived with innovation, technical excellence, and heart-pounding gameplay that demands skill and strategy in equal measure, propelling the genre to new heights.</p>

<h2 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages-8-5">DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>id Software has never been a studio content with resting on laurels, and DOOM: The Dark Ages proves that the legendary franchise still has a lot to offer. The Texas-based studio decided to take players back chronologically, with the events taking place before either 2016's reboot or 2020's DOOM Eternal. Moreover, the setting is vastly changed: the Slayer fights in the techno-medieval world of Argent D'Nur, so the developers reimagined him as a heavily armored warrior. This, in turn, led them to modify the pacing from the relentless, ever-forward-pushing gameplay of Eternal into a slower, more deliberate action experience that relies heavily on the new shield mechanics. </p>



<p>Players can deploy a Shield Saw to parry incoming demon attacks, then either riposte with a melee strike or unleash a charging bash attack to close distances. What makes this system brilliant is that, while inevitably slowing down the combat slightly compared to the previous entry, it remains balanced in a way that forces players to stay in constant motion, thus adhering to the franchise's core formula.</p>



<p>Melee combat also received a complete overhaul with three distinct options: brutal punch combos, a devastating hammer attack, and an armor-shattering flail. All these are genuine tactical choices: ammunition is obtained through successful melee executions, creating a direct link between close-quarters and ranged combat that highlights good decision-making throughout firefights. Finally, DOOM: The Dark Ages features more variety than the series' previous shooter games, thanks to the interspersed mech segments and dragon-riding sequences, which added some perfectly fitting epic setpieces to the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 doesn't just return to the franchise's core identity; it doubles down on the philosophy that made the series legendary in the first place: player-driven destruction and large-scale environmental storytelling. After the mixed reception of Battlefield V and the sheer debacle of Battlefield 2042, Electronic Arts and the teams at Battlefield Studios desperately needed a win. To achieve it, they went back to basics and focused on what fans have always loved about this shooter games franchise. </p>



<p>It could be argued that Battlefield 6 doesn't really include any major innovations, but it didn't need to. The developers just had to bring their A-game to all areas of the game, which they did, starting with the saga's most refined gunplay mechanics to date. Overhauled weapon behavior, revised recoil patterns, and tactile feedback provide a highly satisfying shooting experience that rewards precision without being too hardcore. Every shot, every movement input feels intentional and responsive, especially when played with a DualSense Controller, where Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers elevate immersion (though you might want to turn them off in the settings when playing in truly competitive matches).</p>



<p>The Tactical Destruction system is also back, allowing squads to weaponize their surroundings in ways that directly impact gameplay outcomes. Collapsing a ceiling onto an enemy squad, demolishing cover to create new attacking opportunities, or using vehicle-as-wrecking-ball tactics are all viable choices depending on the situation. Furthermore, the developers demonstrated <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/" target="_blank">that they had learned their lesson from the limitless destruction featured in Battlefield 4's Levolution</a>, as letting players turn entire buildings to dust ultimately harms gameplay; therefore,</span> they removed that option in BF6.</p>



<p>Ultimately, fans vote with their wallets, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's no question that they chose Battlefield 6 this year over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The former, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Alinea Analytics estimates</a>, is the most popular new game released in 2026, having registered over 23.8 million players across all platforms as of November 20.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ARC-Raiders-Keyart-scaled-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">9</a>)</h2>



<p>Whereas Battlefield 6 was by far the most hyped shooter game going into 2025, ARC Raiders didn't really have a similar level of anticipation, especially after the middling reception of the studio's first game release, the arena FPS The Finals. The launch of ARC Raiders was a veritable revelation in the already crowded subgenre of the extraction shooter. Originally, the game was supposed to be a free-to-play co-op (PvE only) shooter. However, Embark decided to change it to a premium PvPvE extraction shooter, even if that meant delaying the game. </p>



<p>This strategy change proved to be extremely effective. First of all, there aren't many third-person extraction shooters in the first place. The main distinction, though, is that ARC Raiders successfully straddles the line between PvP and PvE action, a key balancing act that many games in this subgenre struggle with. Rely too much on PvP, and you lose the cooperative soul that made early extractions appealing; focus too much on PvE, and the game suddenly lacks the unique unpredictability of human behavior.</p>



<p>The game features optional soloing (deliberately harder) but emphasizes 2-3 player squads, where communication is paramount for a team determined to extract with all the loot still in their pockets. The titular ARCs are machine invaders with individual behavioral profiles, weak points that matter, and physics-based destruction that affects their combat capability. Shooting a rotor off a drone causes momentum-dependent spin-outs; removing additional armor sends them careening into environmental hazards or other ARC units. </p>



<p>Like in all the best PvPvE games, the greatest moments in ARC Raiders occur when the two elements suddenly mix, such as when two teams engaged in firefights over loot suddenly face roaming ARC reinforcements. Do they push the engagement and risk mutual destruction, or is it better to coordinate a temporary ceasefire via voice chat against the common machine threat? These dynamic situations are the true reason players keep coming back to it. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders was a smash hit for Embark Studios and Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beating all other games this November on Steam's best-selling chart</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming Google's most searched videogame of the year</a>. </p>

<h2 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h2>



<p>After the narrative missteps of Borderlands 3, Gearbox sought to return to its roots with grounded tone, apocalyptic humor, and mechanical depth. </p>



<p>Arguably, the game's most noticeable improvement is the movement overhaul. Traditional double-jumps, dashes, and weapon-swap speed have been replaced with an extensive traversal toolkit: gliding, mid-air hovering, grappling hooks for both exploration and combat, and dodge-rolls for evasion. Each traversal option serves specific tactical purposes: the hover enables mid-air shots while keeping momentum; the grapple accelerates repositioning; the dash provides split-second emergency maneuvers. Ahead of the launch, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described this</a> as the most significant franchise evolution yet. It has never been more fun to move around in Borderlands, that's for damn sure, and the gunplay itself is still as brilliant as ever, ensuring that the new game can be considered among the best shooter games in this area.</p>



<p>The Licensed Parts System elevates the loot loop. Weapons are now composed of manufacturer-agnostic components, so that an assault rifle might sport Maliwan elemental parts, a Torgue magazine, and Hyperion shielding. Rarity directly correlates with component variety, making the hunt for specific part combinations as compelling as chasing rarity. </p>



<p>The four Vault Hunters feature ability sets that meaningfully diverge in playstyles. Vex, the Siren, conjures manifestations to aid in battle; Rafa, the Exo-Soldier, crafts on-the-fly tools like armor-piercing blades. Choosing and specializing the character is, however, only the beginning of build crafting. The existence of several secondary gear systems (Rep Kits offering revives/combat buffs, Ordnances providing cooldown heavy weapons, Enhancements replacing Artifacts) provides plenty of room for loadout variety.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been significantly streamlined. The improved lobby system, crossplay infrastructure, the return of split-screen couch co-op (albeit only on consoles), and instance-based loot (meaning that every player receives their own drops) provided features that the community had long requested. The dynamic difficulty scaling lets friends play together even if their respective characters are at vastly different power levels. Finally, the ability to fast travel to a teammate eliminates the tedious "someone got lost" moments that plagued previous entries.</p>



<p>The main criticism levied at Borderlands 4 at launch was its performance, particularly on the PC platform, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to 'slightly softer' sales</a> than the parent company, Take-Two, would have liked. However, the game has since received several patches <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to improve PC performance</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metal-Eden-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>







<p>By far the smallest game on this shortlist in terms of budget, Metal Eden, the new game from Reikon Games (the studio behind 2017's <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruiner</a>), is a sci-fi FPS that weaponizes mobility, timing, and tactical resource management into something distinctly elegant. As an android named Aska in the artificial city of Moebius, players harvest Cores (consciousness containers) from mechanical enemies, then leverage those Cores for tactical advantage.</p>



<p>Core Ripping is the game's defining mechanic. Players charge their Multitool's Gravity Beam to extract Cores from unarmored enemies. Once extracted, Cores can either be consumed (providing temporary buffs to melee damage, mobility, or survivability) or thrown as explosives. This creates a feedback loop where killing efficiently generates resources that further enhance Aska's combat capability.</p>



<p>Beyond traditional movement, players unlock several traversal options: hovering via jet pack, grapple-rails for acceleration, wall-running, and eventually a "Ball Mode" that transforms Aska into a rolling projectile capable of dealing damage on its own. Combat, which also includes a bullet-time mechanic, is a thrilling experience that is never really frustrating, because enemy behavior is readable; telegraphed attacks provide decision windows for parries, dodges, or counterattacks. The excellent art direction drives Ruiner's aesthetics with neon-soaked environments, distinctive enemy designs, and visual clarity that never sacrifices style for utility.</p>



<p>With its average playthrough runtime of five and a half hours, Metal Eden is shorter than most recent single player shooter games, but it's also available at budget price. Moreover, every level is meaningful, teaching new mechanics or challenging the player's mastery of them. The boss encounters require an understanding of Aska's mobility toolkit and Core resource management, and the pacing is spot-on.</p>



<p>Metal Eden arrived without much fanfare, but it proved that a tight, focused shooter can succeed thanks to design clarity and innovation borne out of constraints.</p>

<p>If you unwrapped a Nintendo Switch 2 this Christmas, consider yourself very lucky—you’ve just secured one of the hottest gaming devices of the year. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s latest console</a> has only been out since June 5, 2025, but in just half a year, it’s already built a stacked line-up of blockbuster exclusives, upgraded ports, and surprise indie hits. </p>



<p>With a library growing this quickly, it can be tough to know where to start. Do you jump into the flagship first-party titles? Revisit remastered classics? Or explore the early wave of third-party heavy hitters taking advantage of the system’s improved power?</p>







<p>If you’re feeling spoiled for choice, don’t worry—this guide should have you covered. Insider Gaming has put together a definitive list of must-play Nintendo Switch 2 games to help you hit the ground running and make the most of your brand-new console. Whether you’re a long-time Nintendo fan or new to the ecosystem, these are the titles you won’t want to miss.</p>



<h2 id="h-must-play-games-on-the-nintendo-switch-2">Must-Play Games On The Nintendo Switch 2</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take your Kart across the open world. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where better to begin than with the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship launch title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-mario-kart-world-be-getting-dlc-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>? In a bold reinvention of the series, Nintendo has thrown open the track boundaries and delivered a sprawling open world filled with secrets, challenges, and a massive selection of new courses to discover as you explore.</p>



<p>The shake-up doesn’t stop there. Mario Kart World introduces a brand-new race mode: Knockout Tour. Drivers tear through the open world toward a series of checkpoints, and at each one, the bottom four racers are eliminated. Whether you’re racing side-by-side in couch co-op, battling the chaos online, or taking on the AI in solo play, Mario Kart World feels like an instant classic and a must-play for every new Switch 2 owner.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Get searching for those Bananas! Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Move over, Mario—there’s a new 3D platforming king on the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-donkey-kong-bananza-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, from the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, delivers the console’s standout platforming experience. Its lush, interconnected worlds are packed with secrets, clever challenges, and the kind of inventive level design that keeps you exploring long after you finish the story.</p>



<p>DK trades Mario’s finesse for raw power, leaning fully into destruction and chaos. You’ll smash through enemies, tear up the environment, and use DK’s sheer strength to climb, launch, and even rock-surf your way across multi-layered worlds. It’s fast, loud, and endlessly satisfying.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Explore Lumiose City like never before. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can’t talk Nintendo without bringing up Pokémon, and the series’ newest entry is essential for any Switch 2 owner. Pokémon Legends: Z-A breaks from tradition by setting the entire adventure within Lumiose City, swapping sprawling open regions for a dense, ever-evolving urban landscape filled with vertical exploration and hidden pockets of activity.</p>



<p>The big draw is the long-awaited return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-all-mega-evolutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolutions</a>, now more dynamic and impactful than ever. Triggering a Mega form transforms battles into explosive showcases of power and strategy, giving familiar Pokémon a fresh edge. It’s a bold reinvention of the Kalos experience—and one of the standout titles defining the Nintendo Switch 2 era.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Any excuse to revisit Hyrule. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike some of the other games on this list, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom didn’t debut on the Nintendo Switch 2—but its upgrade pack makes it feel right at home. Boosting performance to a smooth 60fps and sharpening visuals to 4K when docked, Link’s latest adventure has never looked or played better.</p>







<p>If you’re new to the Switch-era Zelda games, you’ll want to start with Breath of the Wild to fully appreciate the journey. But if you’re after the most refined and ambitious version of the formula, Tears of the Kingdom is the definitive choice, offering the grandest and most creative Zelda experience available on the Switch 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-hades-2">Hades 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Somehow even better than the first. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hades 2 isn’t exclusive to the Switch 2, but it feels tailor-made for handheld play. Supergiant’s sequel puts you in the role of Melinoë, the Princess of the Underworld, as she sets out to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time. The game builds on everything fans loved about the original—tight combat, stylish world-building, and sharp writing—while giving the series a darker tone and a brand-new mythological focus.</p>



<p>Melinoë’s blend of witchcraft and melee combat keeps every run fast, flexible, and wildly satisfying, especially with new weapons, expanded god Boons, and a deeper cast of characters to interact with. Whether you’re grinding through a late-night run or squeezing in a session on the go, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2 shines on the Switch 2</a> and stands as one of the console’s most satisfying experiences.</p>



<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got a city to burn. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-hits-new-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 is no newcomer</a>, but experiencing it on the Nintendo Switch 2 feels like discovering the game all over again. CD Projekt Red’s ambitious RPG has been refined, expanded, and polished since its original launch, and bringing that definitive version to a handheld console is a massive win for players who love deep, story-driven adventures on the go.</p>



<p>Night City’s dense streets, branching quests, and razor-sharp combat translate beautifully to portable play, making every quick session or long commute feel like meaningful progress. Being able to dive into one of the most elite modern RPGs anytime, anywhere turns Cyberpunk 2077 into a must-play addition to your Switch 2 library—and one of the most impressive handheld feats the console has to offer.</p>



<h3 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Later bosses make this guy look tame. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been one of the most anticipated games of the decade, and its arrival on the Nintendo Switch 2 more than justifies the wait. Hornet’s journey through the towering, trap-filled kingdom of Pharloom builds beautifully on the foundations of the original—faster movement, refined combat, and a world so atmospheric and intricate that exploring it becomes completely absorbing.</p>



<p>While it isn’t a Switch 2 exclusive, it feels almost designed for the hardware. The handheld’s responsiveness brings out the best in Silksong’s precision platforming, making every leap, parry, and needle strike feel incredibly smooth. Pharloom’s layered zones and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-mask-shard-locations-in-hollow-knight-silksong-act-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hidden challenges</a> are perfect for quick sessions or long dives, and the sense of discovery never fades. For Metroidvania fans, this is a must-play and a standout addition to the Switch 2 library.</p>



<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The long-awaited sequel is finally here. Image by Nintendo.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of Metroidvanias, let’s head back to where it all started. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond stands tall as one of the Nintendo Switch 2’s flagship experiences, marking Samus Aran’s long-awaited return to the Prime series. Retro Studios has delivered a bold evolution of the classic formula, blending the atmospheric exploration fans adore with tighter gunplay, richer environmental storytelling, and some of the most visually striking world design the franchise has ever seen.</p>



<p>Though it’s not exclusive to the Switch 2, the upgraded hardware elevates the experience dramatically. The smoother framerate and enhanced fidelity make scanning alien structures, navigating hostile ecosystems, and battling colossal creatures feel incredibly immersive—especially in handheld mode, where the detailed environments and moody lighting truly shine. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-locks-basic-feature-behind-30-amiibo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a triumphant continuation of Samus’ saga and an essential addition to any Switch 2 library.</p>

<h3>"a lot of stick" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Greedy Nintendo! Time and again we hear it, Nintendo are greedy! It is a line that gets repeated so often, I wonder if people actually consider what it means. Shareholders? Nintendo's dividend payments place them just behind Microsoft, as well as many other companies in the gaming sector like Koei Tecmo, Square Enix and Capcom. Executives? In 2024 Shuntaro Furukawa was paid just over a fifth of what Phil Spencer earns at Microsoft. But Nintendo charge too much, especially for older games! Maybe that is true, but they pay their staff quite well and have really high retention rates, they also seem to reinvest what they earn from their popular titles in more niche titles, so maybe the latest release of Super Mario Galaxy will pay fro a new Famicom Detective Club, Another Code or Advance Wars. I also don't think that Gameshare is a feature that screams greed. Nintendo are getting a lot of stick at the moment, and they do make some wrong headed decisions at times, but as far as massive corporations go, they seem ok. We've all gotten used to low prices in gaming, but low prices, high development costs and a fandom that is often reluctant to compromise on quality, is not a recipe for a sustainable industry.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Mcleod</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree that Nintendo, <em>generally</em>, seems to focus on the right things when it comes to experimenting with new ideas, respecting employees, and doing things that other companies wouldn't or couldn't do. That's why we're all here.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything were cheaper, but again, <em>generally</em> Nintendo does a decent job of threading the needle on pricing - although a $50 Kirby amiibo feels like a real ask. Welcome Tour should absolutely have been a pack-in, too, so I get the frustration, especially in this economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I don't think the company needs us defending it from a little childish name-calling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sweaty"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there Nintendo Life!<br>
I wanted to shout out a franchise that I think doesn't get enough credit: Just Dance. I feel like Just Dance is often seen as just that one yearly Ubisoft release that nobody bats an eye at. But this year reestablished for me what a powerhouse it is for social and energetic fun.</p>
<p>This feeling came to me at Comic Con. There was a huge Just Dance setup and it was constantly packed with people. Joining these crowds for the first time was an experience. There's nothing quite like being in cosplay, standing in a crowd of other con-goers and cosplayers, and jumping around to Boney M.'s Rasputin or teaming up with a stranger for Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. No other game there generated the kind of loud and mass fun that Just Dance did, and that's an achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Its appeal is nearly universal. I've enjoyed the game with all kinds of people and in all kinds of places, including in gamer spaces. There's this lovely gaming space I frequent, stacked with consoles and games, so we can play just about anything we want there. Yet a bit ago I booted up Just Dance, and it was a smash hit. We had a blast waving our arms and stepping around the room, with wide grins and loud cries of energetic joy. (Also, shoutout to the accessibility filter and accessible dance routines, so people that can't stand or jump could also join in.)</p>
<p>And speaking of moving around, that's another thing I have to praise Just Dance for. I don't exercise nearly enough: I find it very hard to push myself to do so and I feel deeply uncomfortable and unsafe at gyms. But Just Dance is fun, motivating and accessible enough for me to get up and move with it at least every couple of days. With Just Dance+ there's more than enough songs to keep things fresh, and trying to learn the difficult expert routines to songs like Dua Lipa's Houdini or Britney Spears's Circus and Toxic is genuinely a really fun challenge. I'm not going to act like it's a substitute for proper exercise, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing and I guarantee you that some of these routines will get you sweaty. You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying, I'd love to see it.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Just Dance is a high quality game with lovely visuals, fun and varied choreo's, and appeal everyone including many hardcore gamers. I know it's not for everyone, nothing is, but in so many groups it's been a guaranteed good time for many years, and it deserves more credit for that. Love you Just Dance!<br>
<strong>Zander</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, it suffers from being the known-est of quantities in 2025, but Just Dance is decent and I've had fun with it over the years.</p>
<p>Honestly<em>,</em> "<em>You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying</em>" is prime bonus letter material, Zander. But we're staunch Boney M defenders in this household, and I wouldn't be able to embed this video in the bonus section. Wunderbar. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"throw my hat"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all this talk about animal crossing I've seen a lot of debates about whether new leaf or new horizons is the best. I'd figured I would throw my hat in the ring. I grew up playing new leaf so I have a very strong emotional attachment to that game. I think neither is better than the other. When I play new horizons there are things I wish it had that new leaf, and when I play new leaf there are things I wish it had that new horizons had. For those at the NL towers who have played both what do y'all think?<br>
<strong>beltmenot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wild World was my first, so the impact of anything afterwards is lessened - in my brain, WW is still peak. New Leaf and New Horizons are pretty much on a par. For all the improvements, NH has gotten unwieldy with items accessible in too many different places for my taste, and more to come in the January update. And I'd give anything for an icon that shows if you already own an item on sale in Nook's Cranny!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/poll-so-animal-crossing-new-leaf-or-new-horizons-which-do-you-like-best">We have discussed this before</a>, and most of the team are off on their hols now, but let me see who I can find ransacking the office fridge for party leftovers... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"NL is way better. Too much crafting in NH, it felt like a chore – NL was honed to near perfection." - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"NL - <em>love</em> NH, but the fiddly island customisation, the more homogenous villager personalities, and the huge focus on decorating gets away from what I adored in NL. NL felt a lot more compact and impactful to me." <em>- Alana</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>"nothing substantial"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,<br>
been a while since I joined Your community.<br>
last time i wrote a fan letter i was a kid and wrote to power and games, an italian vg magazine, asking for SFII advice on how to beat m. bison at hard level.<br>
no reply.<br>
I'm 43 and I am writing to you now with nothing substantial to say except for congrats on your hard work.<br>
greetings from Genova, Italy.<br>
<strong>Skoffo</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Skoffo! Greetings to you from the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the Bison tips. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"in lieu"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Splatoon fan, and I know there are others hiding around here somewhere, so in lieu of any news whatsoever at all about Splatoon Raiders or an 11.0.0 update for Splatoon 3, I am here with a list of tiny paint-based games to suggest. Or rather, a tiny list of tiny games, because this genre is not huge, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ink">INK</a> - This is legit my favorite platformer! It's got a such a fun gimmick, good difficulty, and is super satisfying to speedrun! I have nothing more to say, just go buy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a> - This is essentially a Mario Party minigame, yes, but it's super fun! If you've got kids, or nieces, or nephews, or other little ones in your life, this is a good time! (Plus it's being updated regularly, so if you ever have suggestions... send 'em in to Hey! Kookaburra and he'll probably implement them.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> - It's on NSO, and like... 67% of you probably have this, so give it a whirl!</p>
<p>OK, thank you for reading my tiny list of tiny games with ink-based aspects. Have a nice day, and stay fresh!<strong><br>
CaleBoi25</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have NSO, I know a man who's got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">a few copies of Mario Paint</a>. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"There could be a Pokémon game collection with Gen 1, 2 and 3 with remakes included." - <strong>Your fan, Scottdevine48</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much greedy Nintendo would charge for that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hello NintendoLife,<br>
Could you please publish PSA articles about NSO game trials? Not everyone is always online and they are easy to miss." - <strong><em>Morsel</em></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a rolling guide might be best. I'll see what we can do. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I got an NSO N64 controller and realised that it can be used to play Mario Kart 8. Do you know what other non-Nintendo Classics games it works with?" - <strong>OswaldTheLuckyGamer</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that doesn't require a second stick? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I just want to say, I love nearly all of you." - <strong>Ed.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sus. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

              <p>Looking for a new pair of headphones tha sound great but won’t cost an entire paycheck? You might not believe it, but you can get a pair of Beats Studio Pro headphones for a fantastic price. And they sound great, too.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro are exactly what you’re looking for, and they’re more than affordable. Y<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">ou can get them at Amazon for $179.95, which is a $170.05 (49%) discount from their original price of $349.95</a>. If you ask us, that’s a significant price cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones with booming bass and crisp treble in a slick package</h2>
<p>This model is perfect for anyone looking to be fully immersed in whatever they’re doing (listening to music, podcasts, etc.). Their ear cups are well-cushioned and extremely comfortable, so you can wear them for extended periods of time without them starting to hurt. The adjustable headband lets you customize the headphones’ fit, so you can tighten them or loosen them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro excel when it comes to delivering quality audio, and that’s what you’re here for, right? These headphones are able to produce precise and detailed sound no matter what type of music you like to listen to. The bass is deep and full but doesn’t overpower the midrange and treble. Plus, the vocal clarity is crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Another feature of the Beats Studio Pro is the active noise cancellation that helps eliminate ambient noise so you can focus on your audio without distractions. No matter where you may be (on a crowded train, in a busy office, etc.) the ANC feature can make a serious difference. In addition to blocking out distractions, the Studio Pro headphones also have a feature called “Transparency Mode” that lets you allow outside noises in so you can hear what’s going on even when wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, the Beats Studio Pro can give you several hours of playback time on a single charge. In addition to the battery life, the carrying case of the headphones is capable of getting you back up to speed quickly so you are ready to go again. Fast charging is supported by the headphones so you can obtain a meaningful boost to the battery in a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">All in all, the Beats Studio Pro are a combination of powerful sound, comfort and intelligent features in a product that not only looks great but also performs exceptionally well.</a> And you’re not going to find a better deal for some time, being that we’ve reached the end of the holiday gifting season. That means you should snap yours up while you still can.</p>

              <p>I feel like a broken record, but once again, in many ways this was a bad year for developers, gamers, and the industry writ large. But hey, just because AI slop is ruining everything and greedy execs are destroying pop culture, that doesn’t mean we can’t find some joy and genuinely great moments in all the bullshit.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-surprises-games-trailers-video-game-moments-2024-1851725768">Like we’ve</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">done in years past</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-news-announcements-surprises-2022-1849899925">here</a> we’ve collected 10 of the best video game surprises and bits of good news from the past year.

Fans had every reason to respond with groans and sighs to the idea of the premier action-RPG maker turning its attention and resources to exactly that<!--StartFragment --><span>—<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335">an online multiplayer game</a><!--StartFragment -->—</span>instead of toward its next single-player adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But FromSoftware delivered with</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652"><i><span>Elden Ring Nightreign</span></i></a><span>. It didn’t just successfully nail multiplayer <em>Elden Ring;</em> it produced an entire new mash-up of genres that I wish more games would try to experiment with. Do you need close friends to get maximum enjoyment? Sure. But unlike some of the friendslop turning heads out there this year, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s magic goes far beyond capturing hot mics and silly moments. (It’s great for that too, though.) I now expect great things from<em> The Duskbloods</em> and would love to see FromSoftware reimagine </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> PVE for the modern era. -Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Star Wars: Fate of The Old Republic</em> Announced</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653099"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653099">©Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The 2025 Game Awards started off with a super-surprising announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076"><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></a>. This is a new single-player RPG from <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> director Casey Hudson, and is a spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em>. Holy shit, folks! Sure, it ain’t <em>KOTOR 3,</em> but it’s likely the closest we’ll ever get to that game, and that alone has fans excited.</p>

 <p>Before you start getting <em>too</em> hyped to play <em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> it should be noted that the studio working on <em>FOTOR</em> was formed just a few months ago, so this game is likely five or more years away from release and could launch on PlayStation 6 or even PS7.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-fotor-2030-casey-hudson-rpg-rumor-2000653419">Hudson denies this, however,</a> and claims it will be out before 2030. I want to believe him, but I’m not sold on that being possible unless <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is much smaller in scope than most AAA RPGs. We’ll just have to wait and see, and hope this one doesn’t get canceled.</p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo Adds Virtual Boy Emulation To The Switch Online Catalog</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000227927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000227927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000227927">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>There aren’t many people around who fondly remember Nintendo’s failed stereoscopic 3D Virtual Boy console from 1995. It was a big flop for the company, was barely supported by it or third-party studios, and has mostly faded into the past as an odd misfire from the Mario maker.</p> <p>But it is still a part of video game history, and so it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">extremely unexpected but nice to see</a> Nintendo announce Virtual Boy games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. And to let you play these rudimentary 3D games properly, Nintendo is shipping a whole new headset accessory that looks a lot like the OG Virtual Boy. All of this arrives in February 2026.</p> <h2><strong><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> Was Worth The Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653434">©Reef Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>Back in February,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</i>was announced with&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a reveal trailer</a></u>&nbsp;that immediately propelled the game to the top of my most wanted list. With its beautiful pixel art and excellent animation,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate</i>&nbsp;looked like it might finally deliver the pulse-pounding run-and-gun action game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, but never received. Amping up my excitement in the months that followed were videos&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/Zir-oFQT4Io?si=BlpNliC8T3_TfMhi" data-sk="tooltip_parent">like this one</a></u>, which highlighted that the folks at developer Bitmap Bureau had the knowledge, skills, and experience to deliver a game that paid homage to the arcade action classics of yesteryear while also feeling exciting and rewarding today. But you never know for sure until a game arrives, so as hopeful as I was, I also feared that the end result might be a disappointing one.</p>

 <p>Originally set for release in September,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate&nbsp;</i>saw delay after delay, pushing it back to December 12 and making me more anxious than ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418">But the end result proved to be everything I hoped it could be</a>: a gorgeous, varied, challenging, and immensely rewarding action game that not only does the film justice, but earns a place among the best arcade-style action games of all time. What a wonderful surprise to help close out the year! – Carolyn Petit</p> <h2><strong><em>Helldivers 2</em> Comes To Xbox,<em> Gears Of War</em> Goes To PlayStation</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000318" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000318"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000318">©PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>The era of video game exclusives has truly come to an end. I mean, we all sort of knew that already, but in 2025, we watched it happen in real-time in a way that I’ve never seen before. On August 26,<a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"> <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, a remaster of a remake of the first game in the once Xbox-only series, arrived on PlayStation 5. On the very same day, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">PlayStation published <em>Helldivers 2</em> launched on Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>. It was like watching a prisoner exchange on a bridge between two nations that were once at war, but who now have struck a truce.</p>

 <p>And yeah,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092"> playing <em>Gears of War</em> on a PlayStation is strange</a>! I earned Xbox achievements on a PS5. We live in weird times. But I’m also happy that the future seems to be one in which you won’t need to own every console to play every game. That’s nice, and as consoles get more expensive, it will be a boon for gamers trying to enjoy the hobby on a limited budget.</p> <h2><strong>Id Software, Bethesda, and Ubisoft Studios In North America Unionize!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001754">©Bethesda / id Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Despite the bottom falling out of the AAA video game industry this year, gaming’s nascent labor movement has continued to eke out notable victories. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003">Multiple teams at Blizzard</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">announced new wall-to-wall unions</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">while developers at Bethesda</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">secured their first contract.</a> And the organizing isn’t just isolated to Microsoft-owned studios in the U.S.,<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"> Ubisoft Halifax in Canada just formed a union as well</a>. – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite’s</em> Mini-<em>Simpson</em>s Season Was Great, Actually!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640880">©Epic</figcaption></figure> <p>A mini <em>Fortnite</em> season based entirely on<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em> The Simpsons</em></a> could have been a disaster. But despite the odds, Epic was able to make it work and delivered what might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">my favorite season of <em>Fortnite</em> in a long time</a>. The Springfield island map was incredible to explore. The visuals felt very cartoonish and <em>Simpsons</em>-y without looking too garish, and all the <em>Simpsons</em> Easter eggs and characters that appeared throughout the event were a treat for fans. And on top of all that, this season included funny animated segments featuring <em>Simpsons</em> characters that were written by the staff of the show. Is this just one more sign of all of pop culture merging together into a grey slurry? Sure. But whatever, man, I can now play as Moe in <em>Fortnite</em>. I’m happy.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>Shadow-dropped</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000626874" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626874"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626874">©Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Years of marketing, teasers, and trailers are annoying and tiring. I mean, we’ve been waiting years for more information about <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> a game that was announced all the way back in 2018 when E3 was still a thing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265">So getting a remake of 2006’s <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> out of nowhere was super nice.</a> No long waits. No delays. No annoying series of teasers and trailers. Just a reveal and boom, you were playing the game.</p> <p>Based on how well it did, people seem to agree that shadow-dropping a game like <em>Oblivion</em> is a good idea. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-tes6-shadow-drop-todd-howard-release-date-fallout-3-2000642434">Even Todd Howard seems into the idea</a> of launching games like this. And hey, <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> ended up being a solid and very pretty way to play (or replay) Bethesda’s seminal open-world RPG. Now, let’s hope next year’s list of best surprises features an entry about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster shadow-dropping out of nowhere.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> Finally Launches After A Long Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000619153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619153">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> could have easily been delayed out of 2025 or been disappointingly mid when it launched.

The only catch? The offer is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime shoppers will see it at its regular price. That said, if you’re looking to pick up multiple tech items or home essentials for the new year, a Prime membership can be useful. It offers faster shipping, as well as access to member-only discounts that can help you save in the long run. Prime membership costs $15 per month, or $139 a year, but the retailer offers a free 30-day trial for you to try out the perks without committing.</p>

<h2>Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>This compact PC packs a solid punch. It runs on the 13th-generation Intel Core i9 13900HK processor that features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads, plus boosts up to 5.4GHz.

<p>The PC comes with a massive 32GB (2×16GB) DDR4 RAM that makes it easy to multitask through busy days with ease. You will be able to work on a bunch of projects at the same time, use different applications simultaneously, hop between a ton of tabs, take back-to-back meetings, and more – all without slowing down one bit. Even better, the memory can be expanded up to 64GB as needed. Storage capacity is just as exceptional. You’re getting a built-in 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, which offers enough space to house all your important documents, research stuff, media content, etc, in a single place. Like memory, storage, too, is expandable up to 4TB. You can always add more as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Port selection is wide. Connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. The USB4 port takes performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. It’s capable of moving a 3GB 4K video in just one second – something creatives dealing with large projects are going to appreciate. Triple display output is also supported for those looking to create a bigger, more productive work setup. But despite this, the PC stays calm and cool while working. That’s thanks to its advanced dual fan cooling that ensures optimal performance even during resource-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, so you’ve got a system that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>

<p>Fortnite continues to shine year after year, and Christmas is a time when a flurry of festive skins are made available, and the vast quantity of them makes it difficult to rank the very best.</p>



<p>With the annual Winterfest celebration, Fortnite adds new Christmas-themed skins every year, featuring entirely new creations or established characters with a festive spin.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has run the rule over all of the Christmas skins introduced to Fortnite over the years to issue a verdict on the best ever released.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-fortnite-christmas-skins">Best Fortnite Christmas Skins</h2>



<h3 id="h-crackshot">Crackshot</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially introduced on Christmas Eve in 2017, Crackshot is a terrifying nutcracker that makes regular appearances in the Fortnite Item Shop, and stands out as one of the best festive-themed skins in Fortnite.</p>



<p>With five Selectable Styles, Crackshot is certainly worth the 2,000 V-Bucks it costs to purchase, and it will take some doing for the skin not to be considered among Christmas’ best.</p>



<h3 id="h-grimbles">Grimbles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Gnome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Grimbles was first introduced to Fortnite in Dedcember 2018, making repeated appearances since then, and, while he has a much more approachable look compared to some of the other Outfits on this list, it’s certainly not one to mess with.</p>



<p>Grimbles has a Selectable Style that includes red, glowing eyes, transforming the friendly gnome into a rather haunting nightmare.</p>



<h3 id="h-krampus">Krampus</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ho ho horror. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another iconic Christmas skin in Fortnite that first appeared in 2018, Krampus is an Outfit that splits opinion in the Fortnite community, but there’s no doubting it boasts an iconic look.</p>



<p>Anti-Claus is inspired by European folklore, said to be a half-goat, half-demon figure who acts as the opposite to Santa Claus, punishing those who misbehave, so play nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-sgt-winter">Sgt. Winter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Naughty or nice. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battle Pass skin all the way back in Season 7 in 2018, Sgt. Winter shows what Santa would look like if he were to have chosen a different lifestyle and brought the pain rather than spreading Christmas cheer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Sgt. Winter came in the Battle Pass before Fortnite removed the exclusivity restrictions, so the original Sgt. Winter won’t be available again.</p>



<h3 id="h-dolph">Dolph</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hooves and all. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Introduced in 2019 on Christmas Eve, Dolph is a bipedal, almost humanoid version of Santa’s favorite reindeer, though points have to be docked due to the lack of a shiny red nose.</p>



<p>Still, Dolph is a classic Christmas skin in Fortnite and provides a stellar look while you sleigh your enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-polar-patroller">Polar Patroller</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beary good. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Polar Patroller was initially introduced on New Year’s Eve in 2019 and has regularly returned to the Item Shop, including a styint available in November this year, and pairs well with the Dolph skin as both show animals transformed into Fortnite characters.</p>



<p>He doesn’t look as imposing without the grenade launcher he carries in promotional art, however, but you still shouldn’t cuddle this bear.</p>



<h3 id="h-sled-ready-guff">Sled Ready Guff</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unbeatable. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Guff is a fan-favorite character introduced in Fortnite and the Sled Ready skin is arguably the best of them all, with the reindeer attire certainly looking better than the Santa approach in Guff Gringle, where it looks like he’s suffered a bit of sunburn.</p>



<p>Sled Ready Guff was initially available in Chapter 4, Season 1 in December 2022 through completing challenges, and has not been obtainable since. </p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-bushranger">Winterfest Bushranger</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Winter is coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Christmas twist to the traditional Bushranger Outfit, Winterfest Bushranger comes equipped with a Christmas tree design, a Santa hat, and plenty of decorations.</p>



<p>Winterfest Bushranger was released in December 2023, obtainable through challenges, and may feature in the Item Shop in future.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition</link>
            <guid>1392067</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

            <guid>1392049</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, the gaming space went into a downward spiral as several major titles went offline. In a global network issue, the likes of Fortnite, ARC Raiders, Steam, Rocket League, and Marvel Rivals suffered, and of course, gamers took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>



<p>In a quickshot post on socials, Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, lamented the issues with an apologetic message of sorts.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-servers-are-melting-down">The Servers Are Melting Down</h2>



<p>Fortnite was one of the most heavily impacted games in the recent server outage issue that knocked multiple games offline. The blip took down countless top-tier titles, leaving players stranded on Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2004019861807374671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> acknowledging the issues, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The servers are melting down, sorry fam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed that up three hours later with a much more encouraging comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back, and Merry Christmas everyone!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The simple message was a nice note to indicate that even the top-most individual at Epic Games has his finger on the pulse, even at the height of the festive break.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been documented what caused the issue, but given the widespread nature of the blip, it’s safe to assume it was related to the global network infrastructure that seems to be so shaky these days. The issues impacted a diverse array of titles, and this is a problem that’s becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly this year.</p>



<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on networking and the likes of AI, connected living, and cloud computing become much more important, we’re going to see these problems surface much more often.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, given that gaming is almost inherently dependent on good internet these days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-25-928/</link>
            <guid>1392046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s finally here! It’s the ultimate festive day of the year, but before you start tearing open your gifts and scoffing down a Christmas lunch, you need to complete one of the final NYT Connections puzzles of 2025. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can complete the puzzle as quickly as possible, keep your streak going, and get back to the festivities.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections answers!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-25">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 25)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #928:</p>



<ul>
<li>EXCESSIVE</li>



<li>COIN</li>



<li>FLOWERY</li>



<li>FASHION</li>



<li>MELODRAMATIC</li>



<li>HATCH</li>



<li>PURPLE</li>



<li>MAKE UP</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>LAREDO</li>



<li>FLOWER</li>



<li>MIRE</li>



<li>MUSICAL NOTE</li>



<li>RETIRE</li>



<li>WINE GLASS</li>



<li>SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Why be plain when you can go over-the-top?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Be inventive with this group</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Hopefully the answer <strong>stems </strong>from this hint</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think singing scales and warming up your voice</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 25:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-25-928">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 25 (#928)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EXCESSIVE, FLOWERY, MELODRAMATIC, PURPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COIN, FASHION, HATCH, MAKE UP</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, FLOWER, MUSICAL NOTE, WINE GLASS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – LAREDO, MIRE, RETIRE, SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/</link>
            <guid>1392037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that Fallout games are designed to be played for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In the case of Fallout 76, the last major release in the post-apocalyptic series, there’s an infinite number of hours waiting to be explored. In a recent interview, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that these concepts are being built into Fallout 5.</p>



<p>One of the lead developers working on Fallout’s next major iteration revealed that the goal is <strong>600 hours</strong>, in an ideal world. It’s not the kind of game that can be played for just ’20 hours’, but players are going to be given enough meat on the irradiated bones to play for an extremely long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-we-expect-from-fallout-5">What We Expect from Fallout 5</h2>



<p>Being honest, we expected nothing less from Fallout 5. With each new release in the series, Fallout has gotten increasingly expansive and ambitious. Fallout 76 (2018) is a live-service MMORPG that has never stopped evolving, so it stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be similarly impressive.</p>



<p>While we know very little about the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard did recently confirm that it’ll be tied in with the ongoing television show.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, several members of the Bethesda Game Studios leadership team spoke about the future of the franchise. Emil Pagliarulo, one of the most notable developers on the team and the studio’s design director, dropped a tidbit about Fallout 5’s ideal duration:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would be happy with a game that is as successful as the previous Fallout games that continues to give fans what they love, you know, and to give them a story that they can get into and systems that they love and really just an experience that they play not for 20 hours and not for 100 hours, but an experience they can play for 200, 300, you know, 600 hours, because that’s the kind of games we make. That would be my hope going forward: Keep doing what we’ve done, and also to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, those are rookie numbers, as Fallout is the kind of series that can keep providing new experiences 1000+ hours into a run. With the implementation of mods, Creation Club content, expansions, and regular updates, Fallout games have been kept alive and kicking for <strong>decades</strong>, in some cases.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 doesn’t have any kind of a release window, but at this rate, and with the ambitions of the studio, we’d expect it to be 2030 before we even have a teaser trailer released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Update Adds Long-Awaited Quality-of-Life Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-update-quality-of-life-feature/</link>
            <guid>1392034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov players are loading into the game after the most recent patch (1.0.1.0) to find a quality-of-life feature that they’ve been needing for years. When you deploy into your next raid, you’ll notice a UI upgrade that includes a progress bar that represents how long it’s going to take for you to load into your session.</p>



<p>This means it’s no longer based entirely around guesswork as to how long it’s going to take to load into your game. The progress bar shows you exactly where you’re at in the queue, how long the estimated load time is, and how long you’ve already been waiting (which isn’t new, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-small-tarkov-change-big-impact">Small Tarkov Change, Big Impact</h2>



<p>For the longest time, fans of the pioneering extraction shooter that is Escape from Tarkov have been left wanting when it comes to loading into raids. In the worst cases, it can take double-digit minutes before you get into your raid, and you’re left to sit there and let the clock run up.</p>



<p>This latest update, introduced with the 1.0.1.0 patch that also brought about the winter event, ensures that players have a UI upgrade that fixes that to some extent.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: AirwingMarine on X</figcaption></figure>







<p>It doesn’t address long load times – that comes later. Instead, it gives players a mostly accurate representation of how long it’s expected to take for them to get into their raid. This means that players no longer need to sit in their queue ad infinitum. If they see there’s an estimated load time of 10 minutes, they can just back out and try again.</p>



<p>It <strong>has </strong>been reported by players on socials that it’s not entirely accurate right now. One user wrote that their estimated deploy time was over six minutes, and they were in their raid in three.</p>



<p>It’s a minor change for some, but for those who have been playing Escape from Tarkov for a lot longer, it’s a no-brainer addition that is long overdue.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see the UI upgrade in Escape from Tarkov’s latest update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>For all of you gathering together with family and friends, opening presents, gorging yourselves on a bit too much dinner, and all the other trimmings that come with Christmas Day, we hope you have a wonderful time today and through the rest of the holidays that mark the end of the year.</p>
<p>So, on&nbsp;behalf of all the writers here at TheSixthAxis, I want to wish you, your families and your friends Happy Holidays and a very Merry Christmas!</p>


<p>We’d <em>also </em>like to wish you all ¡Feliz Navidad!, Joyeux Noël, Frohe Weihnachten, Buon Natale, Feliz Natal, Crăciun Fericit, God Jul, Wesołych Świąt, Glædelig Jul, Hyvää Joulua, Gleðileg Jól, Wesołych Świąt, Vrolijk Kerstfeest, Sretan Božić, Veselé Vánoce, メリークリスマス (Merīkurisumasu), 圣诞节快乐 (Shèngdàn jié kuàilè), 메리 크리스마스 (Meli Keuliseumaseu), Felicem Natalem Christi and Nollaig Shona! (And to everyone around the world a Happy New Year!)</p>
<hr>
<p>Once again, 2025 has been a years filled with challenges for people all through the country and the world, and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With the deep impact of wars continuing to be felt in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we can only hope for peace and resolution and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>

<p>If you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, while Christmas is a time of cheer for many people, it can also bring up difficult memories. If you find yourself needing help or support at this time, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">Mind</a>, <a href="https://giveusashout.org/">Shout</a>, and <a href="https://www.childline.org.uk/">Childline</a>&nbsp;are all charities in the UK that focus on mental health, awareness and crisis support. You can reach them via the above links or at the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samaritans – call 116 123</li>
<li>Shout – text SHOUT to 85258</li>
<li>Childline – call 0800 1111 between 7:30 and 3:30pm every day</li>
<li>Mind – call their infoline on 0300 123 3393</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s so many different charities and causes out there that you can support and,&nbsp;if you’re in a position to do so, we would encourage you to do just that.</p>

                <p>I prefer to play my games without mods or console commands to get as close to the intended experience as possible. But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Console Commands</h3><p dir="ltr">Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Cheats</h3><p dir="ltr">We have a full list of Console and Debug commands further down, but we would be remiss in not mentioning our favorite command: Cheats.</p><p dir="ltr">For Cheats to work, you'll need to download and install the <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/SML" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)</a>, with additional information in the <a href="https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/SMLChatCommands.html" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Modding Documentation</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of our favorite Cheats include: NoPower, NoCost, TurboProductionMode, and Teleport. NoPower still requires that you wire up your machines, but you don't have to actually power them. NoCost makes machines and the like free to place. TurboProductionMode turns crafting at the bench into an instantaneous affair. Finally, Teleport puts you wherever you like on the map, which is great for when you manage to get yourself into a precarious position between a big drop and some predators who haven't noticed you just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Below, you'll find listings for all console, debug, and cheat commands, per the Satisfactory Modding Documentation page and the <a href="https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Console" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki</a> on Fandom.</p><h3 dir="ltr">All Console, Debug, and Cheat commands</h3><p>Console Commands</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>?

When enabled, no items are required to build things with the build gun. Crafting stations still require ingredients.</td></tr><tr><td>NoPower &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables or disables the NoPower cheat, which is saved in the save file, and persists even when mods are uninstalled. When enabled, buildings still require a power connection, but they require no electricity to run. Vehicles also do not require fuel.</td></tr><tr><td>TurboProductionMode &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>When enabled, all items craft instantly in the workbench and workshop. Buildings are unaffected.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemStacks &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Stacks&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of full stacks of an item to the player’s inventory. If the inventory isn’t big enough to hold it all, extra slots will be granted as well. You can find an item’s Blueprint Path on the Satisfactory Wiki, finding the content on a reference list, or via searching around for it in FModel. You can also use it to give yourself additional inventory slots via GiveItemStacks "" numberOfSlots</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemsSingle &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Items&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of individual items to the player’s inventory. Unlike GiveItemStacks, if the inventory can’t hold the items, the inventory will NOT be expanded. You can find an item’s Blueprint Path on the Satisfactory Wiki, finding the content on a reference list, or via searching around for it in FModel.</td></tr><tr><td>GiveResourceSinkCoupons &lt;Amount&gt;</td><td>Adds AWESOME Sink coupons to the pool that can be printed at an AWESOME Sink. Does not affect how many points it takes to earn the next coupon.</td></tr><tr><td>Slomo &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Speeds up or slows down the entire game by the given multiplier. This includes player movement, particles, animations, etc. It has an effect on building operation rate, but not as pronounced as one may expect. For example, 10.0 makes Copper Sheets craft in around 3.5 seconds instead of the 6 seconds they take at 1.0.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeOfDay &lt;Hour&gt; &lt;Minute&gt;</td><td>Sets the world time of day in 24 hour time format.</td></tr><tr><td>SetTimeSpeedMultiplier &lt;Multiplier&gt;</td><td>Sets a world time of day speed multiplier. Set it to 0 to freeze the day/night cycle altogether.</td></tr><tr><td>EnableBuildableTick &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables/disables AFGBuildable ticking, which controls if buildings are animated. They will still produce items at their regular rate even when this is set to false.</td></tr><tr><td>PlayerFly &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables/disables the vanilla flying cheat.</td></tr><tr><td>PlayerNoClipModeOnFly &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Enables/disables noclip when in cheat fly mode.</td></tr><tr><td>FlipVehicle</td><td>Flips the vehicle you are currently in by 180 degrees. If you’re upright already, it will flip you upside down.</td></tr><tr><td>ResetAllFactoryLegsToZero &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Makes the support legs on all buildings reset to their default height. The boolean argument controls if it should "repopulateEmptyLegs," presumably if they were deleted somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>RebuildFactoryLegsOneTileAroundPlayer</td><td>Recalculates the support legs on buildings near the player. If the gap is too large, they will just reset to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>FillAllFreightCars &lt;percent full, float&gt;</td><td>Fills all freight cars in the map with a nameless, descriptionless placeholder item. The argument controls how close to full they are, with 1.0 being 100% Freight cars that already had items in them when this command was run will have the items emptied instead of set to the fill percentage.</td></tr><tr><td>EmptyAllFreightCars</td><td>Empties all freight cars in the map of their contents.</td></tr><tr><td>HideAllBuildings &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Hides or shows all factory buildings. They still have collision.</td></tr><tr><td>ShowFactoryOnly &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Hides or shows all terrain, including the skybox and its light. Disables your flashlight when enabled. It still has collision.</td></tr><tr><td>ForceSpawnCreatures</td><td>Forces active spawners to spawn creatures even if the creature isn’t set to spawn yet (because of day/night restrictions etc.)</td></tr></tbody></table>
