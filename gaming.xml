			<p>The Little Nightmares series has become a favourite amongst fans of grotesque horrors. The puzzle platformer has that grim and grimy aesthetic, with that unnerving need to constantly hide from the unnervingly large and terrible inhabitants of these worlds. While you had an AI-controlled partner through Little Nightmares 2, and can continue to play solo in its upcoming sequel, Little Nightmares 3 will finally let you share these horrors with another person.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III – You're in for a Ride | Pre-Order Trailer - Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6zYcE_Rl_kU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I asked Little Nightmares III Producer Coralie Feniello about taking this jump, and how co-op can share out and maybe reduce the horror. “That’s something we thought about at the beginning,” she said, “would it be as scary playing co-op? I think it’s just a different atmosphere, a different vibe, but it’s not like removing the fear from what I’ve seen. Sometimes people tend to just have a lot of empathy together and to just feel the fear from the other one, so it’s kind of a balance at the end. But it is quite different because sometimes you will laugh, sometimes you will have fear. When you play alone – I mean, single player – you will keep a bit more immersed in the atmosphere, like the sound will be kicking in more and things like that.”</p>


<p>There’s a pair of new characters found within Little Nightmares 3, as Low with his beaked mask, cape and bow, and Alone with her tufts or red hair, green jumpsuit and wrench journey through the Nowhere and a spread of different realms found within. Once again, their journey will be told wordlessly, but as Coralie said, “More is not always better. We wanted to tell a lot of things to everyone, and then we realised that it’s not working like that in speechless stories. We want to tell very impactful story points at different points of the game and then all the complexity of that all goes in the environment. We do know that fans tend to have a lot of theories and so they will enjoy and see what’s going on in the environments, but everyone should have something at the end.”</p>


<p>Our hands-on came while playing through a section known as Carnivale, which is dark and depressing for more reasons than just the lashing rain that’s pouring down as we visit. The first thing that surprises, as we find ourselves washed up on a sea shore at the start of the demo, is that we’re not bound together by a shared screen space. With co-op being exclusively online, Little Nightmares 3 avoids that co-op game conundrum of whether to allow for split screen or keep characters together within view of the screen, and so instead lets you both meander and view the world entirely independent of one another. It’s an interesting choice that does allow for more freedom when exploring the scenes presented to you.</p>
<p>“That’s also one of the reasons why we are online co-op and not couch,” Coralie revealed, “because we didn’t want it at all to have a split screen. In Little Nightmares, each room is, I would say, like a frame […] each room comes from craftsmanship and each room has a lot of details and we do want each room to be seen in full screen. I think that’s super important with the camera view.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to reach the carnival itself, with hunched over visitors to the carnival having little real interest in you –&nbsp;they’re far more concerned with having what looks like an absolutely fantastic time! Sure, they’re tightly wrapped up in coats to withstand the rain, and the crowds are a bit thick to get anywhere all that quickly, but there’s plenty of greasy looking food, all these lit up tents to visit, rides to spin around on, tubs for apple bobbing –&nbsp;try not to drown, though! – and the odd pinata to smack with a stick. Sure, it might not actually be a pinata, and really just be the upended corpse of a former guest, but when you’re blindfolded, what’s the difference? I guess there’s fewer sweets that come out… It’s all delightfully dark and twisted.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the almost incidental fun and games that I could engage with as well, playing as Low with the bow and arrow. There were plenty of balloons to target and pop with a quick auto-aimed arrow shot, but then there was also a pop-up target carnival game that I spent a good few minutes trying to best. Surprise surprise, it was rigged so that even just hitting three targets in time needed frame-perfect precision, though Coralie claimed that it’s technically possible to win…</p>
<p>But Alone isn’t left out from these interactions. Coralie said, “It depends on the chapters! I think from the Necropolis to the first one, you find things things to break on the ground that got a bit more, like pottery and things like that. So that’s kind of fun as well. But yeah, I think the long distance off Low makes it a bit more satisfying on the side for an environmental stuff, but also Alone gets to open secret doors. At some points when you have some hidden collectables, it’s usually behind secret walls that Alone can break.”</p>
<p>Journeying through this together, there’s some classic two-player puzzles to work through. You’ll have to collaborate to push and pull heavy objects; one player will have to boost the other up and over to reach a switch or movable object; one person pulls a lever to move a platform for the other, with a second lever or new path that they can later access. It’s familiar on a pure gameplay level, but wrapping it up in that grimy Little Nightmares aesthetic and having the ability to explore independently gives it a distinctive feel and tone.</p>

<p>That’s accentuated in moments where combat comes to the fore. In many situations, your only option is to sneak as quietly as possible and hide, the much larger beings of this world keen to hunt down the pointy white little Nomes and other small people as quickly as possible. But there are moments of combat as well, bringing the bow and wrench to the fore. You still need to work in tandem to get through these moments, as creepy animated dolls spring to life and come after you. Low can get in the first strike, a crack shot to knock off their head, but the body keeps on coming, needing you to lure it away so that Alone can finish the job by whacking the noggin into the floor once and for all. It’s satisfying, and I’m keen to see how other enemies and combat moments come together.</p>
<p>It was a key point for the team to build around, Coralie said: “Earlier Little Nightmares games already had some little combat with pipes and stuff that you find in the environment. Here, we really wanted to use the cooperation to be able to bring that to the players and also bring some gameplay that will be time dependent – basically, you need to do something and the other one has to do something kind of at the same time.</p>
<p>“Something that we’ve seen with the play is that for a lot of players, it’s way harder to play in multiplayer than in single player for that, because you could mess up in single player, but the AI will not, and if you are in multiplayer, both of you can mess up, so it’s like twice the risk of not being able to do it! But that’s really fun to see, I think.”</p>

<p>This is still thoroughly Little Nightmares, keeping so much of the tone and feel of the first two games, from the dank visuals to the trial and error sometimes needed to figure your way past deadly monstrosities. Sharing this with another person does change that in that always enjoyable fashion. You’re joking and wise-cracking as you go, conferring to figure out puzzles, taking turns to apologise for messing up a particular encounter. For me, it does lighten the horror a bit, but if that’s what you demand from Little Nightmares then, well, you don’t have to play together…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-iii-preview-%E2%80%93-co-op-nightmares.1293642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Little Nightmares</em> has really earned a reputation for itself as one of the premier spooky sort-of-platformers out there. It's garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">lots of acclaim through word of mouth</a>, and that's paid off. According to Bandai Namco, it's sold 20 million units across the franchise.</p>

<p>However, this time around, things are a little different. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-thq-nordic-has-bought-little-nightmares-developer" rel="nofollow">Tarsier Studios was acquired by Embracer</a>, the franchise stayed with Bandai Namco. Now Supermassive Games of <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-pictures-anthology" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Pictures</em> fame</a> is helming development for <em>Little Nightmares III</em>.</p>

<p>Another big change here is the shift toward co-operative play. While not strictly required, single-player gameplay still slots in an AI to control the opposite character. In other words, teamwork is essential in this game—and in some cases, detrimental to its fun.</p>



<h2>Low and Alone in the Middle of Nowhere</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III</em> stars two children named Low and Alone, and they're lost in a surreal world called the Nowhere. This space exists between dreams and reality, and they're trapped in the Spiral, which comprises of multiple dystopian worlds.</p>

<p>In my demo at PAX West, we played through the Carnevale level. I controlled Alone, the girl who wields a giant wrench like a club. A colleague played as Low, who uses a bow and arrow.</p>

<p>Almost every puzzle we ran into required some form of teamwork. Practically every crate needs both players to push or pull them, and defeating enemies requires a coordinated one-two punch, starting with an arrow to the head.</p>

<p>It fosters this sense of desperation and dependency in the player. You know you're not strong or able enough to escape this spooky place alone, and you need your companion if you want to have any chance to survive.</p>

<p>Overall, Supermassive did a good job of making the Carnevale feel unnaturally spooky and otherworldly. The oppressive rain creates a dreary atmosphere, and honestly, carnivals at night are already pretty unsettling. Add an army of creepy-moving puppets and giant, mangled hunchback types, and you've got yourself a perfect vibe for Halloween month.</p>



<h2>Co-Op Brings Worries</h2>

<p>While the overall vibe and atmosphere set the mood well, I found myself pretty quickly taken out of it at various times throughout our play session.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles felt a bit too obtuse for us to figure out, which left us re-exploring the space over and over again until we realized the solution. And it wasn't that we overlooked the next step; we both found signals to be unclear, and they didn't quite telegraph what the solution was.</p>

<p>Other puzzles required skulking around monsters a very specific way using stealth. The windows for running from one place to the next felt just a little too tight for how slow the characters move while crouching. Even worse, figuring out the solution to these segments often means getting a little further than you did last time, scrambling to figure out what's next, and hopefully hiding before you're caught.</p>

<p>When one player is seen, it's a pretty immediate game over. There's no leeway to avoid capture, and then you're reset to the latest checkpoint. Honestly, the co-op aspect only made this more frustrating, as now you're both replaying the same thing and hoping the other doesn't reset the sequence.</p>

<p>I'm all for immersion and letting players discover the world, but when the punishment for the slightest error is constant retrials, the cycle tends to get wearisome.</p>

<p>Granted, part of this is a skill issue, which I'll readily own up to. I've also never played the previous games in the series. The Carnevale sequence we played occurs partway through the game, so I'd like to hope that by the time you naturally get there with your co-op partner, you'll both understand the gameplay and signals better. As a vertical slice with no context, I found it to be appropriately atmospheric but obtuse to the point of frustration.</p>



<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With such a focus on co-operative play, I do find it odd that there's no split-screen or same-screen option for in-person co-op. This feels like a great opportunity to spend time together in the same space, and facilitating an online session through Discord or something feels like it gets in the way of the magic.</p>

<p>Even worse, I feel like playing the game solo wouldn't capture the same essence, considering how the core gameplay works. Waiting on an AI partner to do its part feels like it could come off a little hollow, but I'm just speculating.</p>

<p>Still, I think if you're looking for a spooky game for the Halloween season, <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is shaping up to be a decent option, if not for its atmosphere alone. It feels properly haunted and eerie thanks to the oppressive nature of the enemies and the dark, dreary presentation. I just hope the puzzle work and stealth sections feel better as the gameplay naturally ramps up from a fresh start.</p>

<p>The HP 14 is super light, weighing in at only 3.24 lbs. It only 0.71 inches thin. These together make the laptop highly portable as they should have no issue slipping into most backpacks. Great for schlepping back and forth between classes.</p>
<p>Battery life is solid. You’ll get up to 11 hours of use on a single charge. When it dies, it only takes 45 minutes of charging to bring it back over 50%. You can comfortably bring it to your classes without worrying about packing the charger every day.</p>



<h2>Free Gifts Included</h2>
<p>Alrighty, let’s get to the freebies. With this HP laptop, you’ll get a handful of accessories that will help you on campus.

                <p>United States Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced that the National Institutes of Health are looking into a range of issues as it relates to what may contribute to gun violence in the United States. He also cited video games as a possible cause of real-world violence.</p><p>"The firearms question is a complex question, and it's not an easy question," he said in response to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">question from PBS</a> about if the government is looking into mental health when it comes to gun violence.</p><p>He called out a variety of factors that could contribute to an uptick in real-world violence, including "dependence on psychiatric drugs," along with video games and social media. "We are initiating studies now that look at the correlation and the potential connection between over-medicating our kids and this violence." He did not elaborate on video games, however.</p><p>This comes not long after RFK Jr. appeared in a tense Washington hearing in which senators questioned him about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-tense-hearing-rfk-jr-challenged-on-vaccine-views-and-trust-in-health-agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">his views on vaccines and numerous other claims</a> he has made over the years. Many have called for his resignation, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/rfk-jrs-family-members-call-for-his-resignation-say-he-is-a-threat-to-americans-health" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including his own family members</a>, while <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5483021-hhs-employees-call-for-rfk-resignation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some CDC staff walked out in protest.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH-AXTo3Am8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qH-AXTo3Am8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>What some studies have already found</strong></h2><p>For years, people have maintained there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/professor-it-s-clear-playing-violent-games-increases-aggressive-behavior/1100-6417754/" data-ref-id="1100-6417754">absolutely a connection between violent video games and increases in aggressive behavior</a>. A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790614/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2019 study from Tobias Greitemeyer</a>, a Department of Psychology professor a the University of Innsbruck in Austria, suggested that time spent playing violent video games "increases aggression in the player." The research also suggested that "violent video game play also affects individuals with whom the player is connected."</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34801150/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another study</a> found that, "Exposure to violent media, especially violent video games, may cause desensitization to real-life violence." <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354552/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One further study</a> found that video game violence "should be considered a risk factor for aggression, as in other violent media, as it provides a social reinforcement of aggressive behavior and observational learning of aggressive models."</p><p>A study from Oxford discovered <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-02-13-violent-video-games-found-not-be-associated-adolescent-aggression" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no link</a> between aggressive behavior in teenagers and the amount of time they spent playing violent video games. "Our findings suggest that researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games," co-author Dr Netta Weinstein from Cardiff University said.</p><p>This study came after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/violent-video-games-dont-lead-to-increases-in-viol/1100-6422421/" data-ref-id="1100-6422421">years of published, vetted research</a> that showed there is no connection between violent video games and increase in violent crimes.</p><h2><strong>What has Trump said about video games?</strong></h2><p>RFK Jr.'s boss, US president Donald Trump, has previously spoken out about violence in video games.</p><p>"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trump-blames-video-games-for-mass-shootings-indust/1100-6468929/" data-ref-id="1100-6468929">the president said in 2019 following mass shootings in America</a>. "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which lobbies on behalf of the video game industry and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/if-this-new-video-game-loot-box-bill-becomes-law-i/1100-6456767/" data-ref-id="1100-6456767">seeks to avoid government regulation</a>, said "numerous scientific studies have established that there is no causal connection between video games and violence."</p><h2><strong>This has been a talking point for some time</strong></h2><p>The debate about violent video games and what effect there may or may not be on real-world violence has been going on for decades. Some may recall how then US Senator <a href="https://youtu.be/d3GTJOZLaPY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hillary Clinton said in 2005</a> violent video games are a major problem and studies have shown they are bad for children. She also said violent video games should be regulated like alcohol and tobacco.</p><p>"Violent video games increase aggressive behavior as much as lead exposure decreases children's IQ scores," Clinton said. "We need to treat violent video games the way we treat tobacco, alcohol, and pornography. We know these products are damaging to children and we ned to give parents the tools to keep them out of kids' hands."</p><h2>RFK Jr. is, or was, invested in video games</h2><p>In 2024, RFK Jr. revealed that he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/21/rfk-jr-says-he-invested-24000-in-gamestop-amid-re-.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">invested $24,000 into GameStop</a> as a means to show support for retail investors over institutional investors following the 2021 GameStop short-squeeze situation. RFK Jr. said he invested in GameStop after Keith Gill AKA Roaring Kitty resurfaced in May 2024--when GameStop's shares were trading around $17--and reignited the GameStop stock phenomenon. After Roaring Kitty began posting again, GameStop's stock price surged, and the stock price remains above $23. We don't know if RFK Jr. still holds a position in GameStop.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-will-host-another-nintendo-direct-this-friday.1293600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This coming Friday, September 12, 2025, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT, Nintendo will host another Nintendo Direct event the day before the 40th anniversary of the release of Super Mario Bros., <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-set-for-mid-september-2025/">confirming reports </a>from the end of last month that a Direct event was coming sometime during mid-September.</p>



<p>The news was announced through the Nintendo Today! mobile app, and will be the second general Nintendo Direct of 2025, as every other Direct event has had a specific focus, whether it was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-nintendo-switch-2-gameplay-deep-dive/">game-specific Direct</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">Partner Showcase</a>, or the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-direct/4-2-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, which did have multiple game announcements but focused mainly on showcasing the new console.</p>



<p>A post on the official Nintendo of America X (formerly Twitter) account followed the Nintendo Today! app's news, confirming that this is another general Direct just focused on games and that it will be approximately one hour in length. </p>



<p>"<em>Join us on Sept 12 at 6am PT for a</em> <em>Nintendo Direct! Tune in for roughly 60 minutes of information on upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch games.</em>" </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Of course, we can't know exactly what Nintendo plans to show at this Direct, but the top guess is that we'll finally get a release date for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond at this event. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-rated-in-south-korea/">rated in South Korea this past July</a>, and was featured at <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-still-slated-late-2025-playable-later-this-month/">Toronto's Fan Expo event last month with a playable demo</a> available for attendees. All signs point to it getting a release date announcement soon, and it's a good bet that we'll get that news this Friday.</p>



<p>Besides Metroid news, because it is taking place a day before a major anniversary for the company, this could also be where we finally get our first look at the next mainline 3D Mario game, and learn if Nintendo is indeed making a direct sequel to Odyssey, or if the next game is going in a new direction. Either way, it's doubtful that Nintendo will go the whole event without mentioning the Super Mario Bros. anniversary, so you can expect some news regarding what Nintendo has planned for the date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct show for this month, and it's set to deliver a significant amount of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1965762503821935034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on social media, Nintendo says the Direct, which is scheduled for this Friday at 9am Eastern, will feature "roughly 60 minutes of information" on games coming to both machines, and this one isn't a Nindies show or a third-party showcase; it's a true blue Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't mean it won't feature indies or third-party efforts, but it does hopefully mean we can expect to see what Nintendo itself is cooking up for both Switch consoles for the next year or so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=Fgz1lE3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=DocM9Ngv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully find out what Nintendo is up to in the next Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>This will mark Nintendo's third major Direct of the year; the first was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, just prior to the announcement of the Switch 2, and it was followed by a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">partner show in August</a>&nbsp;and an indie presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">just a few days after that</a>.</p>

<p>This Direct feels particularly significant, however; it's the first opportunity we'll have had since the Switch 2 to see what Nintendo's plans for the future look like, including whether any major releases for the studio's big franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>are in the works.</p>

<p>It's also likely, assuming the game hasn't been delayed, that we'll be getting a release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">the long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</em>during this Direct. The game is still scheduled for a 2025 release, but no specific date has been announced by Nintendo thus far.</p>

<p>Whatever's on the cards, this Direct will be longer than the Japanese gaming giant's shows often are, so we'll hopefully get a good chance to go in-depth on the upcoming Switch 2 and Switch slates.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo is currently suing Pocketpair, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for patent infringement, which has already caused the studio to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">change the game's mechanics</a> at least once.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, Nvidia is soft-launching its latest gaming GPUs in the cloud — upgrading its $20-a-month GeForce Now Ultimate cloud gaming service with RTX 5080 graphics for select games, with more to come down the road. At the same time, it’s also adding thousands more titles to the bring-your-own-games service by letting you install them yourself, while also unlocking a 360Hz mode for ultra-fast desktop monitors, launching a 90Hz version of its Steam Deck app, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming">and more</a>.</p><p>Do all these changes make GeForce Now fundamentally better? Absolutely, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on">it was already pretty good</a>! But while playing I couldn’t escape the thought: it’s a good thing Nvidia isn’t charging extra for most updates, because they’re a little underwhelming right now.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077 is playable with all the Nvidia eye candy — if you use all the Nvidia tricks.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p id="what-is-geforce-now"><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2></p></div><p>For the uninitiated, Nvidia’s GeForce Now is a game streaming service that farms the graphical processing power out to the cloud. Instead of controlling a game running locally on your Steam Deck or MacBook or phone, you’re effectively remote-controlling an RTX 5080 or 4080-powered* gaming rig in a server farm many miles away, which you sync with your existing Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, Xbox, and Battle.net accounts to access your games and savegames from the cloud.</p><p>*Nvidia’s GeForce Now also technically has a free tier, and a “Performance” tier, but I recommend you ignore both. For me, it was the difference between playing many games through a clean window or a dirty window, the difference between playing <em>Alan Wake II</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> with full ray tracing or none at all, the difference between comfortably stretching to 4K or not.</p></div><p>Don’t get me wrong, more power is always welcome, and more power is what I saw. In <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s built-in benchmarks, two of the few I was able to run, Nvidia’s cloud-based RTX 5080 offered anywhere from 25 to 50 percent gains over the old RTX 4080 servers at 4K resolution.</p><p>That’s enough to play the former at near-max settings on a 4K TV, and the latter at 4K <em>if </em>you either sacrifice ray tracing or let Nvidia’s DLSS 4 frame generation add an extra fake frame for every real frame to smooth things out. My <em>Cyberpunk </em>framerate is better than we saw with the physical card!</p><p>But I quickly discovered that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">like with that physical RTX 5080</a>, the company’s marketing is moving faster than its tech can actually go.</p><p>There are so few RTX 5080-enabled games as of launch that I had a hard time finding them, and there’s currently no way to tell until <em>after</em> you launch <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> or <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> that it’s still running on a 4080-class GPU instead.</p><div><h2>GFN RTX 5080 vs RTX 4080 (4K)</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and mode</h3></th><th><h3>RTX 5080 (average/low fps)</h3></th><th><h3>RTX 4080 (average/low fps)</h3></th><th><h3>Percent increases</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Native 4K max spec</td><td>50 / 39</td><td>36 / 29</td><td>38 / 34 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Native 4K less RT</td><td>65 / 48</td><td>50 / 38</td><td>30 / 26 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, Native 4K Ultra</td><td>85 / 69</td><td>56 / 47</td><td>51 / 46 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Quality</td><td>45 / 41</td><td>31 / 27</td><td>45 / 51 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Balanced</td><td>55 / 49</td><td>39 / 34</td><td>41 / 44 percent</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, RT Overdrive DLSS Balanced 2x FG</td><td>99 / 91</td><td>71 / 63</td><td>39 / 44 percent</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>And to get the huge framerate gains that Nvidia’s promising from RTX 5080, you’d need to have its servers generate three fake frames for every real one — which, when you combine it with the lag of cloud gaming, dramatically slows the speed a game reacts to your movements. I didn’t need to spend long trying 3x and 4x frame gen in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to find it was a non-starter for me: the game portrays Indy in his prime, but he suddenly felt like a sluggish old man.</p><p>But I’ll admit 2x frame gen actually felt pretty viable over a cloud connection, at least when plugged directly into my desktop over ethernet.</p><p>On the speedier side of things, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">my colleague Tom Warren</a> tried out <em>Overwatch 2</em> in Nvidia’s new 360Hz mode, and says he found it “easy to be competitive with,” but unfortunately that mode’s only limited to 1080p resolution. “Streaming at 1080p on a 4K monitor wasn’t the best,” he says.</p><p>It’s important to note the point of buying a 360Hz monitor is typically for better reaction times in esports games, not the smooth framerate itself, and Nvidia is getting you nowhere near a true 360Hz (2.78ms) reaction time this way. But Nvidia claims it does deliver up to 360fps and <em>can</em> get you down to 30 milliseconds, which is incredible for cloud gaming and should be better than a console in your living room. In the <em>Overwatch 2</em> example, Nvidia says it’s only adding 1.8ms of encode, 0.3ms of decode, and 9ms of game engine activity and rendering, to the time it takes for you to press a button and send data across the internet to Nvidia’s servers and back.</p><p>Meanwhile, though the 90Hz Steam Deck app is unequivocally an upgrade for the Steam Deck OLED’s 90Hz screen, making a smoother experience overall, I was surprised to find an RTX 5080 doesn’t necessarily improve performance beyond that. In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, </em>the RTX 5080 wasn’t enough to run the game at 4K on max settings any more than the RTX 4080 was, so I tested at 1440p, and saw roughly the same framerate of 55fps (lowest in big outdoor battle) to 90fps (indoor environment) regardless of which GPU I was using.</p><p>(Yes, I do recommend streaming at much higher resolutions than 800p to the Steam Deck’s 800p screen, because oversampling makes for a clearer and crisper image with fewer cloud gaming artifacts.)</p><p>Last but not least, I tested Nvidia’s new “Install-to-Play” feature, which should drastically increase the number of games you can play on GeForce Now by letting you install any game that’s opted into Valve’s <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloudgaming">Steam Cloud Play</a>, even if Nvidia hasn’t taken the time to test. There, GeForce Now basically just exposes its copy of Steam so you can install and launch any game you own that wasn’t supported before:</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Those games install even faster than I imagined: it took 17 seconds to install the 1.4GB <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1815570%2FAces__Adventures%2F" rel="sponsored">Aces and Adventures</a></em>; 53 seconds to install the 8GB <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1675830%2F1000xRESIST%2F" rel="sponsored">1000xResist</a></em>, the game I haven’t stopped thinking about all year, 1 minute 22 seconds to install 2.2GB worth of <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>, and and 2 minutes 9 seconds to install <em>Sleeping Dogs’ </em>10.5GB of data.</p><p>But while Install-to-Play works, and quickly enough it might even be OK not to bother paying extra to avoid having to reinstall them every session (persistent storage is $3 for 200GB, $5 for 500GB, or $8 for 1TB per month), it doesn’t yet fill in the majority of GeForce Now’s gaps the way I’d hoped.</p><p>It only added 21 more games to my GeForce Now library. Without Install to Play, I could only access 162 out of my 472 Steam games via Nvidia’s cloud, and that number has only slightly budged. Now I can play <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>System Shock 2</em> and <em>Tomb Raider Anniversary</em> and the <em>Golden Idol</em> games, sure, but realistically I’d just play those natively on the Steam Deck. Perhaps I’d feel differently if I only had a phone or a Chromebook, though. And perhaps we’ll really see the advantage going forward, as it lets Nvidia add new titles far more quickly than before.</p><div><p>Just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760219/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-cloud-gaming#:~:text=I%20have%20no%20updates%2C%20they%20have%20chosen%20not%20to%20be%20on%20GFN%2C%20and%20you%20should%20go%20ask%20them%2C%E2%80%9D%20Fear%20tells%20me.">don’t expect Sony or Rockstar</a> to bring their PC games to the service.</p></div><p>Lastly, while I expect this is a symptom of the pre-launch test servers, I ran into unusual bugs testing GFN RTX 5080 and Install-to-Play. The client sometimes forgot my streaming settings; GeForce Now sometimes thought I was trying to log in from Virginia and Steam blocked that login; I had other sign-in issues and an occasional black screens, issues syncing games with Steam and Uplay, found some games wouldn’t launch right away anymore after I clicked them, and so on.</p><p>If you see those same issues, or if you find Install-to-Play brings surprising new gems, let me know!</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/775222/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-5080-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

So, if you’re doing work life seriously or studying, it won’t slow you down, and you’ll get decent battery life for it.</p>



<p>Internally, the laptop comes with 32GB of RAM which is the memory that enables your computer to have several programs open at the same time without lagging. Put simply, the more RAM you have, the more smoothly things go when switching between tasks or working with large files. This laptop’s generous memory puts you ready to handle demanding programs, so you won’t find yourself waiting around for things to load. Besides that, it also comes with a generous 1TB solid-state drive where all of your apps and documents reside.</p>
<p>You’ll be running Windows 11 Pro, the professional version of Microsoft’s latest operating system. It’s designed for business and serious users and offers strong security features along with tools that make managing your work easier.</p>
<p>What makes this deal even sweeter is the bundle of accessories included: You get a <strong>stylus pen for easy touchscreen operation</strong>, a camera privacy cover to ensure your privacy during video calls, <strong>a 128GB USB flash drive for extra portable storage</strong>, a <strong>dust plug</strong> to ensure the ports remain free from dust, a carrying sleeve for protective transport of the laptop, and a microfiber cleaning cloth to have everything spick and span.</p>

              <p><span>We love to say that every Pokémon is probably somebody’s favorite, but the way Game Freak </span><a href="https://x.com/GatorEXP/status/1963942694859780583"><span>suddenly started going really hard on Malamar</span></a><span>, the squid-like creature whose claim to fame is its bizarre evolution requirement that makes you hold your 3DS upside down while its pre-evolution form, Inkay, levels up, had the makings of a propaganda psyop that I would not fall for. Since last week, The Pokémon Company has been </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1963588689684017623"><span>posting videos</span></a><span> and sending out care packages showing an uncharacteristic level of adoration for the squid. I love a good bit, and I like that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is leaning more into a memetic absurdism instead of a squeaky-clean, family-friendly image. So I had to wonder, what was this all leading to? It turns out, Malamar is one of the old Pokémon getting new love in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with a Mega Evolution.</span></p>  <p><span>The live-action trailer reveals that all this excitement is due to a Malamar, which has gone into overdrive after it mega-evolved, using its hypnosis on the citizens of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world. Once the ‘mon changes forms, it can hypnotize people to the point of completely changing their personalities. Its appearance is a bit more slender than in its base form, and its body becomes luminescent, emitting a rainbow light that seems to be the source of its hypnotic abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>It’s nice that more obscure Pokémon are getting Mega Evolutions in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. Dragonite and Victreebel are cool additions, but we can always use more non-Generation I representation when giving old Pokémon new forms. I do wonder, though, if the game will find some way to implement Malamar’s signature odd evolution style into the Mega Evolution. Maybe you’ll have to hold your Switch or Switch 2 upside down to acquire its Mega Stone when the game launches on October 16.</span></p>

		<p>The next Nintendo Direct has been confirmed to take place this week on Friday 12th September at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST / 10AM EDT / 8AM PDT).</p>



<p>The news has come exclusively through the Nintendo Today app at this moment, and there’s minimal details outside of the date and time. Typically we are given information of the length of time and some kind of indication on the scope of the Direct, whether the focus will be on a particular system, first or third parties, or indies, but the walled garden of information presented within Nintendo Today doesn’t have this.</p>
<p>More information will likely come out as the news spreads to Nintendo’s public social media and the placeholder YouTube stream page goes live.</p>
<p>Until then… we’ll probably get a release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> this time, wouldn’t you think? The game is still set for launch in 2025, and is a significant first party project for both the length of its development and the fact that it’s coming to both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>In case you happened to miss it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is out now on the Switch 2, and it's really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">rather good</a>.</p>
<p>Despite leaning heavily on tried-and-tested survival horror tropes, Bloober Team's latest delivers a fascinating story involving time travel, big helmets, and gross, gooey creatures that have the ability to merge with dead bodies. Gross. If you're a genre fan or you simply enjoy well-told stories, this one might be for you.</p>
<p>To highlight its support for the Switch 2, Bloober Team has concocted an awesome new live-action trailer that showcases the game's two timelines while demonstrating multiple methods of control, including the Switch 2's mouse mode. You can watch it first right here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is the latest new IP from Bloober, with the team recently garnering critical acclaim for its work on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake on PS5. It's been confirmed that a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> is also in the works, but we sincerely hope that Bloober is keen to expand the world of Cronos in the future too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-rtx-blackwell-upgrade-brings-cloud-experience-closer-than-ever-to-local-%E2%80%93-but-latency-remains.1293555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>On the eve of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> an imminent major upgrade to the GeForce NOW cloud gaming experience. The new server hardware (upgraded from RTX 4080-class Lovelace to RTX 5080-class Blackwell GPU and an AMD Zen 5 8-core CPU) is available starting today to Ultimate subscribers who access the RTX server SuperPODs in San Jose, Los Angeles, Chicago, Newark in the US, Frankfurt, Germany, and Paris, France. More cities will be gradually upgraded; you can follow that progress <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/server-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<p>The hardware itself provides a noticeable boost in game performance, especially for those games that support the RTX 50-exclusive DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation feature. Indeed, it is little wonder that of the 23 PC games currently enabled to leverage the more powerful GeForce NOW hardware, most already support DLSS 4 MFG:</p>



<p>● Apex Legends<br>● Assassin’s Creed Shadows<br>● Baldur’s Gate 3<br>● Black Myth: Wukong<br>● Borderlands 4<br>● Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br>● Counter-Strike 2<br>● Cronos: The New Dawn<br>● Cyberpunk 2077<br>● Diablo 4<br>● Doom: The Dark Ages<br>● Dune: Awakening<br>● Dying Light: The Beast<br>● The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br>● Grounded 2<br>● Hell Is Us<br>● Indiana Jones and the Great Circle<br>● Mafia: The Old Country<br>● Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024<br>● Overwatch 2<br>● Titan Quest II<br>● Warframe<br>● The Witcher 3</p>



<p>The performance upgrade is entirely comparable to moving from the RTX 4080 to RTX 5080 desktop GPUs. That would already be cause for celebration, especially since it's a free upgrade. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-off-significant-level-up-of-the-geforce-now-experience-at-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I pointed out in my Gamescom 2025 report</a>, there's much more to this GeForce NOW 'level up' than just moving to RTX Blackwell-powered server hardware.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GeForce NOW RTX 5080 4K@60 Cinematic Quality Streaming - Black Myth: Wukong Benchmark" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sec98y4q5bs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cloud streaming now supports up to 5K@120FPS, 1440P@240FPS, or 1080P@360FPS, provided you have a compatible device. Moreover, NVIDIA has introduced a new suite of features labeled Cinematic Quality Streaming (CQS), which includes, among other things, YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and improve the clarity of in-game heads-up display (HUD), and DPI awareness. The whole point of CQS is to combat the inevitable compression artifacts that come with any type of streaming. At Gamescom, NVIDIA demonstrated that this is particularly useful in highly detailed games like Black Myth: Wukong to better surface details like vegetation and hair that suffer more than others from compression issues.</p>



<p>Now that I've had the chance to test the GeForce NOW upgrade at home, I realized that CQS does have a limitation: frame rate. More specifically, the full suite of CQS algorithms is only available when selecting the Cinematic setting under Streaming Quality, and Cinematic only allows streaming up to 60 frames per second. If you want to choose Custom Mode, which enables up to 5K resolution and 120 frames per second, you must be aware that, according to NVIDIA, 'visual quality will not be prioritized and turning on all of these features may impact other aspects of streaming performance'. Custom Mode does, however, let you enable 10-bit YUV 4:4:4, AI Video Filter (which can be further customized with 0-10 sliders for denoising and sharpening), and the HUD sharpness filter.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>This was a slight disappointment, as it seems like there is no current way to get the absolute best of both worlds. Having tried both, with a 120Hz (or higher) display, I would pick Custom Mode, as I did not notice a significant difference in clarity and sharpness between the two. However, the captured footage was based on the Cinematic setting, mostly because YouTube is limited to 4K@60FPS anyway.</p>



<p>For the test, I used my LG G5 55" OLED TV, the same one I use regularly for my gaming PC, which is equipped with NVIDIA's flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Being used to local gaming on the display, I can still spot some visual differences (mainly, a softer image, even with the new sharpness filters) when playing on the cloud, but there is little doubt that they have gotten a lot smaller. The visuals enabled with CQS and the RTX Blackwell upgrade are top-notch and easily surpass anything in gaming, save for the high-end local PC experience, and that is compared against very pricey hardware. On this account, GeForce NOW is absolutely the more convenient choice.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="GeForce NOW RTX 5080 4K@60 Cinematic Quality Streaming - Assassin's Creed Shadows Benchmark" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqbu1Ymfq2s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, even with the improvements made to latency (such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a>-powered hardware packet pacing), I could definitely feel the difference in control responsiveness: playing the same game on the cloud is just laggy enough to notice when moving the character. Now, of course, as with all network-related things, your mileage may vary there. That said, the thing is, while I am not in an ideal situation (the closest server, Frankfurt, is some 1250km, or 776 miles, away from my place), for most users, it is unlikely to get any better. As you can see, the handy post-session GeForce NOW report shows excellent network scores, with a ping that stayed between 22 and 29ms during the whole testing. I was, of course, using an Ethernet connection and wired controls; wireless connection and controllers would likely increase the lag feeling even further.</p>

<p>Even testing the 1080P@360FPS streaming in Overwatch 2 did not really make it feel like playing locally, I'm afraid, with the added downside that playing a competitive game is much more punishing, whereas you can easily adjust to the slightly laggy movement when you are playing a single player or even a coop game. Personally, I would never play a competitive game this way, but that is perhaps also because I would never be able to entirely shake off the thought that I might just have finished off that enemy if only I were playing locally.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="GeForce NOW RTX 5080 360FPS Streaming Test - Overwatch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-nNRFrxF2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There is one little caveat: L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). The IETF network protocol is now enabled by default in the GeForce NOW streaming settings, but it won't actually do anything if your ISP <strong>and</strong> the router you are using do not support L4S. The technology can potentially improve network latency, so it could be a way to reduce the aforementioned slight perception of lag. Still, I could not really test it as neither my ISP nor my router support it. For now, only Comcast and T-Mobile have introduced it to their networks and users, so it's a long way from being widely adopted.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>NVIDIA's GeForce NOW was already by far the best cloud gaming experience available, and the RTX 5080 server upgrade, coupled with various other improvements, only increases the distance between the platform and its competitors. There is absolutely no question that, if you want to play games on the cloud, this is the way. The visual quality is now a near-match for the local experience, but the responsiveness is not. L4S adoption may help a little, but I suspect the physics limitations will remain a mostly unavoidable hurdle for the foreseeable future. </p>



<p>Because of this, cloud gaming still seems a better fit for relatively casual players who won't notice or suffer from the latency too much. Most gamers would fall into that category, though, which makes it not that big of a problem for NVIDIA. Furthermore, there are two additional aspects to consider: noise and energy. GeForce NOW has the advantage over local gaming on both sides, providing a silent and much more economically savvy experience.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-tear-the-ascension-preview-%E2%80%93-move-over-silksong.1293552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a good year for sidescrolling action games. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review-cutting-edge" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></a> was wonderful surprise from SEGA, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a> could be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/pax-west-2025-x-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist" rel="nofollow">first of two great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games this year</a>. I'm sure I don't even need to mention <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> either.</p>

<p>At PAX West, I found what could be the next sidescrolling metroidvania to keep the party going early next year, and that's <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by a small but mighty team in the Philippines, this game has a nice pace of combat, a charming art style, and a solid foundation for what could be a fun adventure.</p>



<h2>Classic High-Speed Action</h2>

<p>Honestly, my first note I wrote in my notepad for this game was, "That's that good shit." The combat is silky smooth here, reminiscent of games like <i>Dead Cells</i>&nbsp;and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>.</p>

<p>From the jump in the demo, I had access to a robust move set that kept me mobile and engaged. Thre's a double jump, dash, air dash, and a backwards dodge just like Alucard's. There's a basic multi-hit combo attack that you can dodge out of almost whenever you'd like.</p>



<p>The biggest rule-of-cool move here is this warping spear that I unlocked partway through the demo. When it connects with an enemy, you appear slightly above and behind them, ready to rain down a quick combo. Equal parts mobility and offense, it was something I spammed whenever I had the chance.</p>

<p>It opened up a fun way of thinking as well, where I'd sometimes leave enemies alive but with low health. If I was in a corner, one well-aimed spear zipped me away to relative safety.</p>



<p>In general, I found myself always wanting to be on the move because it just felt good to move. And you'll want to stay mobile, with the number of enemies and attacks that the <em>Fallen Tear</em> throws at you.</p>

<p>I thought the healing mechanic was nifty, too, as it rewards aggression. Pressing down on the D-pad spends some meter to heal, though it's pretty minimal. Some enemies drop red orbs when they die, and as long as they're on screen, Hira, the protagonist, will suck them in to heal more substantially.</p>



<h2>The Power of Friendship</h2>

<p>Fallen Tear: The Ascension also borrows some inspiration from JRPGs, featuring a party of people you can recruit and swap in and out. You meet them along your journey, but they won't necessarily be out and about, wreaking havoc by your side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, you sort of "equip" them. You can have up to three at a time, and each one will provide a passive buff. Additionally, they'll each have an active ability that's mapped to when you hold a shoulder button and press a face button.</p>



<p>When three are equipped, you can build up a meter and expend it to do a big group attack using your entire party, which is a great way to unload big damage on a boss.</p>

<p>These characters are more than just combat buffs, though. According to the Steam page for <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>, you can bond with these party members throughout the story, which is giving <em>Persona </em>social links to me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's supposed to be a larger focus on these bonds in relation to the story, per its inspiration from JRPGs. I'm all for the power of friendship being a core part of the story, and I hope to see more of it as it comes out next year.</p>



<h2><em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With its charming, hand-drawn art style, <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> is a treat to look at, especially in motion. When it pulls you in, it keeps you there with its engaging combat and fluid movement. I can only hope that feeling stays for the long-term as the story unfolds in the full game.</p>

              <p>As has been much rumored over the last couple of weeks, an hour-long Nintendo Direct has now been officially confirmed for September 12. That’s Friday of this week, if you’ve lost track of your calendar. It’s timed to fall the day before Mario’s 40th birthday (well, the 40th birthday of <em>Super Mario Bros. </em>at least, Mario himself did exist prior to that), so it seems likely that’ll be at least part of the focus. Of course, there’s also a lot of expectation around <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>.</p> <p>It’s obviously a very big deal for Nintendo that the franchise that turned Mario into a superstar and that coincided with the company invading Americans’ homes with the NES is turning the big four-zero, so it’s enormously unfortunate that this should have fallen on a Saturday. Presumably the console company has at least <em>something</em> cute to announce for the occasion, even if it’s not the next big&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em> game we’re all hoping for, but it would get lost if announced over the weekend. The next choice would then be Thursday, Nintendo’s preferred day for Directs, and close enough that it could still create enough buzz for the big day. It’s just, this Thursday is September 11, and pretty much everyone knows it’s a disastrous day to announce anything as people will find some sort of negative association with the events from 24 years ago. So that pretty much left the company with Friday.</p> <p>As for what will be revealed, we have very little idea. Obviously what everyone wants to hear is news on a follow-up to Switch launch game <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, but given the team behind it was responsible for the just-released&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, that doesn’t seem enormously likely. Possible, though! Nintendo is notoriously secretive, and if the team was split into two, or a whole new group were given responsibility for the aging plumber, there might be something to reveal for this holiday season? I’m just wildly hoping at this point.</p>

 <p>Of course, Nintendo has approximately 32 million different&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> franchises, and it would be ridiculous if there weren’t something to reveal for at least one of them. Hopefully not yet another remastering, but maybe a new 2D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> platformer? Maybe a new&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario</em>? That’d be sweet.</p> <p>The other big game about which we’ve heard almost nothing is&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. We know the game is close to done, because it keeps getting rated in various countries around the world, but there’s not been an official word on a possible release date. I bet my bottom that this gets revealed on Friday, perhaps with an announcement for a forthcoming <em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>Direct, given that seems to be the current approach. If it&nbsp;<em>weren’t</em> to be mentioned in this week’s Direct, then everyone will start to get extremely squirrely.</p> <p>Given the Direct has no given theme, it’s possible that there could be all manner of holiday game announcements. Let’s hope so! In the meantime, you can camp the live stream right now. It’s all due to start 9 a.m. ET on September 12.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-major-changes-ahead-of-new-ultra-hard-end-game-mode.1293537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a while since FromSoftware made any big changes to<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em> but today’s patch brings a surprising number of significant tweaks. It’s full of bug fixes, character reworks, and other changes players will want to be aware of before descending into the multiplayer roguelite’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hard-mode-deep-night-ranked-2000620376">new Deep of Night endgame mode</a> that goes live Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Anyone who’s been paying attention to the datamined leaks around Deep of Night will know it’s a multi-level retooling of the regular game that adds <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">much more challenging enemies</a> as well as debuffs that weigh players down as they journey through Limveld. Successful runs will build players’ ranks, helping them to reach lower depths where enemy health and power keeps getting multiplied. I expect it to be like hitting a brick wall, otherwise known as playing E<em>lden Ring Nightreign</em> during that first week after it launched.</p> <p>But the patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1022">today’s 1.02.2 update</a> reveal important changes to the rest of the game as well.</p>

 <h2>Night Tide’s damage is going up after the second night</h2> <p>It’s become common for players to kill the second boss in each run and then run around the map taking damage from the rain to clean up a few loose ends or get that last level needed to reach 15. FromSoftware is trying to put and end to that by jacking up how much damage players take from the rain before ascending to take on the Nightlord.</p> <h2>The icon for Holy damage finally looks different from lightning</h2> <p>One of the cruelest tricks Nightreign played was making its first boss weak to holy and then making the holy symbol look indistinguishable from the lightning one. Months later, seasoned players might still confuse the symbols when rapidly scrolling through their inventories. To fix that, the symbol now has an orange hue (lightning is more green) and has more visible balls of light orbiting the blade. Hallelujah. It only took four months!</p>

 <h2>ED Libra finally got nerfed</h2> <p>The hardest boss in the game is getting dialed down a bit. I’d love to know what the clear rate was on Everdark Sovereign Libra compared to the rest. The goat summoned Condemned warriors to fight on its behalf who were copies of the players facing him. Those Condemned will now have less damage negation when being re-summoned, drop light shards that buff players more, and be less likely to dodge ranged attacks. The Guardian version will do less damage and all of them will target players differently, presumably meaning that they’ll actually attack Libra when he performs the Rioting ritual.</p> <h2>Targeting will be less finicky</h2> <p><em>Nightreign</em>‘s targeting system is terrible. It doesn’t activate unless your character is facing the target and it can get very sticky when you’re trying to quickly switch. One important fix, though, will help alleviate one source of constant lock-on pain, at least for PC players: “Fixed a bug where it was difficult to switch targets with a diagonal input.”</p>

 <h2>Lots of Relic changes</h2> <p>Here are the ones that stand out</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>Adjusted the effect “[Wylder] Standard attacks enhanced with fiery follow-ups when using Character Skill (greatsword only)” to consume stamina when performing follow-up attacks.</li> <li>Increased the attack power of the “[Wylder] Art activation spreads fire in area” burn effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “Continuous HP Recovery” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect.</li> <li>Changed the “[Recluse] Activating Ultimate Art raises Max HP” effect so that the HP increase persists until an attack is received, even after the art’s duration ends.</li> <li>Increased the amount of Runes obtained through the “Critical Hits Earn Runes” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the “HP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> <li>Increased the potency of the effect “FP Restoration upon (specific weapon type) attacks” effect.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2>Guardians are getting buffed</h2> <p>FromSoftware is throwing the weakest class a bone or three. Guardians will get better strength and dexterity gains as they level, better attack on Halberd guard counters, and higher range on their ultimate art’s attack. All of this should help them be much more effective in the early game while being even tankier in the final boss fights.</p> <h2>There might actually be penalties for leaving games now</h2> <p>I wrote <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-leave-abandon-penalty-matchmaking-1851785434">all the way back in July</a> that <em>Nightreign</em>‘s penalty system for disconnecting felt fake. Players left all the time and never reported getting temporarily banned from matchmaking. Well, that’s about to change. “Disconnecting from a session due to network issues or quitting the game during a session in progress will result in penalties, which may limit multiplayer capabilities,” the new patch notes read. “Rejoining the session you left will remove the penalty imposed upon disconnection.”</p> <p>The timing couldn’t be better because I have a feeling a ton of players are about to start rage-quitting their Deep of Night runs.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has secured a new patent that could have major implications for future Pokemon-inspired games. Granted on September 2, 2025, <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/12403397?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI2ZjY5MzZiMi01M2Q1LTQ3NzUtYTgzNy02Y2NmMDkwNDM0OTAiLCJ2ZXIiOiJhMjM2NjRjYS1hNTNmLTRjOTItYjBjMy1lZWY1ZmYzMDVkOGEiLCJleHAiOjB9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the filing describes a system</a> that “covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” within a video game.</p><p>The patent application (<a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Games Fray</a>) was filed in March 2023 and was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office without any objection. It appears to be specifically focused on Pokemon-like games with its description and accompanying artwork, but there is concern that the wide-ranging text could potentially allow Nintendo to issue lawsuits against other companies and their games if they feature vaguely similar gameplay mechanics.</p><p>While Nintendo probably won't be taking companies like Atlus and Square Enix to court over established franchises with summoning mechanics like Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Final Fantasy, the existence of the patent could be discouraging to smaller studios, given the litigious nature of Nintendo.</p><p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has been in the crosshairs of Nintendo ever since its game was released in early access, as Nintendo sued the studio in Japan. In a statement, Nintendo explained that it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld infringed on multiple patent rights--specifically patents <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>.</p><p>Pocketpair recently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Pokeballs--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <p>There have been rumours circulating for a while, but now we have confirmation: Nintendo is hosting its next Nintendo Direct presentation this week.
</p>
<p>Per the platform holder, the stream will be broadcast online on Friday, <strong>12th September at 2pm BST</strong> (that's 9am ET or 6am PT, 3pm CEST if you're in Europe). </p>
<p>The show will run for 60 minutes (which is quite long for a Direct these days!) and promises to include updates and releases for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>It's actually quite peculiar timing for Nintendo: we've had a general Direct on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-july-31">31st July</a>, and then another specifically dedicated to Kirby Air Riders, too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-direct-announced-for-19th-august">on 19th August</a>. This is quite close concentration for these events (no that I'm complaining).
</p><p>It is not year clear what the showcase will present, though it is worth noting there is a very substantial anniversary coming up as the world gets ready to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros (which takes place on Saturday). Will we see anything special to mark the occaision? Will get get a second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">year of Luigi</a>? Will Waluigi ever be let out of whatever cage he's been crammed in? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Outside of Mario, everyone is hoping for a release date of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> Beyond - after all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-officially-esrb-rated-sparking-hope-for-release-date-news">the nonsense</a> we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">seen</a> about the game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-no-longer-out-now-as-london-underground-advertisement-is-updated">past few months</a>, you'd hope Nintendo is actually finally ready to pull the trigger and release the damn game.</p>
<p>We'll find out more on Friday. What are you hoping to see? </p>
<p><em>This is a news-in-brief story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dambuster Studio has teased that they’re working on Dead Island 3, a sequel to their hit series revival with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>.</p>
<p>Writing in a note that celebrates 14 years since the first Dead Island game was released by original developer Techland, the studio also noted that over 20 million people have played Dead Island 2 since its release in 2023, before closing out that “the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…”</p>



<p>It looks like Jacob is set to return for the next game, traipsing down a dusty road out of LA, and this could be giving us some clues as to where the next game will be set. The look of the road would suggest that he’s heading toward the desert inland, possibly towards Las Vegas, most likely, but could we be jet setting off to another country? The stickers on his luggage mention Banoi, the island where this series started, and LA, but there’s also stickers for Australia, Ireland and the Coliseum. Obviously these would logically be places where he’s visited in the past, but teasers don’t always have to make too much sense.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2’s success is great to see, given the difficulties that the game went through in getting made. Techland had a messy breakup with publisher Deep Silver (now Plaion) and went off to make their Dying Light series, while the Dead Island franchise stuck with the publisher. They initially partnered with Yager (<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a>), but after the game’s announcement at E3 2014, development didn’t progress as planned, and the game was taken away and given to&nbsp;Nottingham-based Dambuster Studios, the team previously behind <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/homefront-the-revolution">Homefront: The Revolution</a>, but with a longer lineage back through to the TimeSplitters franchise.</p>

<p>The game is a solid return for the zombie smashing series, as I wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/18/dead-island-2-review/">Dead Island 2 review</a>, “Dead Island 2 does a great job of reanimating this dormant zombie-battling series, with the gore-filled combat and excessive weaponry that goes well with the oversaturated LA setting. It’s an enjoyable romp, but at the same time, ironically feels like it’s playing it safe.”</p>

<p>60 minutes of Switch and Switch 2 news</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a8a22963cba0/nintendo-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well it's that time again, folks! Nintendo has announced via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> that yet <em>another</em> Direct presentation will be taking place on <strong>12th September 2025</strong> (yes, that's this Friday), hot on the heels of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> in July and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> in August.</p>
<p>The showcase is set to kick off at <strong>2</strong><strong>pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am ET / 6am PT</strong> and will provide 60 minutes' worth of news and announcements on games heading to the Switch 2 (and possibly the Switch). You can find the exact time that things get underway in your region below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PDT / 7am MDT / 8am CDT / 9am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CEST / 4pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10pm JST / 9pm AWST / 11pm AEST</li></ul>

<p>As ever, the full presentation will be streamed on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional variant), and we'll also be hosting a stream right here on Nintendo Life, so you can watch along with us and have a good old natter about all of the announcements.</p>

<p>As for what's in store..? Well, who knows. There are known quantities like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, the former of which arguably <em>needs</em> a release date at this point. Probably both of them, actually. But of course, there's likely to be a few brand-new surprises in store for 2026, too.</p>
<p>There's also the small matter of Super Mario's 40th Anniversary. Kind of a big deal, y'know? Nintendo announced quite a few neat little things for the plumber's 35th anniversary, including the likes of the <strong>Game &amp; Watch: Super Mario Bros.</strong> alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> for the Switch. We're expecting big things for this latest milestone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/honor-of-kings-world-gamescom-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-a-new-contender.1293504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the smashing success of Genshin Impact, many developers have tried to catch the wave and release free-to-play games that could rival the game developed by HoYoVerse. Although reaching the same level of success is definitely a daunting task, many upcoming games are showing a level of quality that rivals not only that of the HoYoVerse game but also of premium games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-second-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-gacha-anomaly/">Neverness to Everness</a>, which combines a modern city setting with clear Persona series-inspired vibes, which could do wonders for the experience as a whole.</p>



<p>Another game to watch for fans of the genre is&nbsp;Honor of Kings: World. Based on the extremely popular MOBA Honor of Kings, the open-world action RPG promises to deliver an engaging experience with a beautiful and massive world to explore and gameplay that's a little more involving than current free-to-play open-world RPGs on the market.</p>



<p>During last month's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a>, I had the chance to briefly try out the game with a demo that featured the very beginning of the game as well as content from later segments of the experience. After a flashy introduction which serves as a tutorial, I took on the role of a new student at Jinxia Academy, meet some of my fellow students and embark on a first adventure through the world of Primaera. Right from the beginning, Honor of Kings: World seems to get the scale of its world right, as both the Jinxia Academy and its surroundings looked vast and gorgeous, promising to offer tons of different activities like crafting, house-building, and more.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Honor of Kings: World is setting out to be a great open-world action RPG with a focus on multiplayer.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With my short time, I couldn't explore much of the world, preferring to focus on one aspect of the Honor of Kings: World that seemed well-done from the brief tutorial: the combat system. Being a free-to-play open-world game, things are obviously going to be kept accessible, but I couldn't help but notice how fighting enemies is slightly more involving than in other similar games, featuring some advanced mechanics like perfect dodges, multiple skills with very different effects and synergy potential, weapon switching, and more. While Honor of Kings: World is hardly going to be on the same level as character action games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, or Ninja Gaiden, the game sported a surprising amount of depth that made the couple of boss battles I got into in the demo very fun and, at times, quite challenging, as enemy design definitely seemed to be on point with varied movesets. Sadly, I wasn't able to try out any of the game's multiplayer features, which will be optional and won't prevent solo players from accessing any content, but the feel I got trying the game was that of an engaging mix between a lite character action game and the Monster Hunter series, enhanced by a competent dungeon design featuring some simple puzzles and plenty of alternate paths featuring treasure that inceintivize exploration.</p>



<p>With not much information on how monetization and gacha mechanics will be handled in the first release, it is difficult to say how Honor of Kings: World will end up faring against similar games when it launches on PC and mobile platforms before the end of the year, and if it will be able to charm even those who do not know the massively popular MOBA it is based upon. At its most basic level, however, I can safely say that Honor of Kings: World has everything it needs to go head-to-head with other F2P open-world RPGs and even with premium games.</p>
