			<p>Zenless Zone Zero is miHoYo's latest gacha game, which is very different from<a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-codes-for-september-2024-how-to-redeem/"> the games</a> that came before. Zenless Zone Zero is now getting its version 1.2 update, which will be released on September 25, 2024. The update will be known as "Tour de Inferno," where Proxies will begin to travel to new locations within New Eridu. This update takes players to a specific area called the Outer Ring and they will get to join in with some motorcycle riding with Caesar and Burnice, characters from the Sons of Calydon faction.</p>
<p>Caesar and Burnice will also be available in the 1.2 banners if you want to get your hands on the fearsome Sons of Calydon characters. They are both S ranks, so it may be challenging to get your hands on them and may take a couple of attempts. However, they may be worth pulling for if you want a powerful team composition.</p>
<p>In addition to this new storyline, a brand-new mini-game is appearing in Zenless Zone Zero called Bizarre Brigade. To play it, you have to make your way over to Goldfinger, where you'll also experience new events, such as the Overlord's Feast. There will also be the Phantom Hunt, led by Rain who has a bunch of difficult commissions for Phaethon to complete. Additionally, there is the Shiyu Defense: Ambush Node, which will only be available for a limited time, with everyone being given permission to participate.</p>
<p>There will also be bounties for players to participate in, including advanced bounties, in which players will receive double the rewards for participating in the events.</p>
<p>While the Zenless Zone Zero website doesn't offer much information about what to expect other than some cool graphics, plenty of content is being added to the game. This includes new W-engines to get your hands on to make your team members more powerful, as well as new Drive Discs to obtain and new enemies to fight.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the Zenless Zone Zero website shows the art of all the new content coming to the game. It also showcases some of the fixes and optimizations being made to make the game a more enjoyable experience for players.</p>
<p>There is plenty more for players to dive into in Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.2, with new Bangboos to collect, new storylines to complete, and the introduction of the new faction, as listed above.</p>

                <p>Later this month, Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-plays-like-a-mini-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6526268/" data-ref-id="1100-6526268">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> is finally giving Zelda a leading role in her own franchise. However, someone has apparently leaked the Echoes of Wisdom ROM weeks before the game's scheduled release, which means spoilers for the game may already be circulating online.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-rom-reportedly-out-in-the-kingdom" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> has reported that the Echoes of Wisdom ROM leak is real. But the channel is also refusing to share any footage from the Echoes of Wisdom ROM while citing the potential ramifications if they had chosen to do so. The Zelda Lore account on X has also confirmed that the leak is real while noting that it's playable on emulators.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZeldaLoreYT/status/1834264204020162902" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">WARNING! Echoes of Wisdom has LEAKED. people already have it on emulators. Be careful if you want to remain spoiler free.</p>  — Zelda Lore (@ZeldaLoreYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeldaLoreYT/status/1834264204020162902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The vast majority of Switch owners are far more likely to buy the game than to play the leaked ROM. But as alluded to by Zelda Lore, the real fear among Zelda fans is that the story will be spoiled before the dedicated players are able to get their hands on the game. Just because Nintendo Prime has shown restraint about running clips and footage from the leak doesn't mean that every YouTube channel is going to follow their example. It's almost inevitably going to show up on YouTube no matter how many takedown notices Nintendo files.</p><p>Similarly, it's likely that videos and spoilers will be posted on X, TikTok, Instagram, Threads, and other social media platforms. The only way to get ahead of that is to start muting all keywords related to the Zelda franchise. That's not a foolproof solution, as some spoilers may still slip through. But that's the best available option for any gamers who intend to stay on their chosen social media platforms ahead of the game's release.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be released on Switch on September 26. It will throw another wrench in the ever-changing official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-timeline-has-seemingly-become-more-baffling/1100-6526274/" data-ref-id="1100-6526274">Zelda timeline</a>, which seems to now place both Switch games in their own continuity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Code Zero remakes may not be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake was, according to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>Talking on The Snitch's Discord server, well-known insider Dusk Golem talked about what's next for the series, saying that the two remakes are the only remakes of the series in active development, alongside the yet-to-be-revealed ninth entry in the franchise. The insider also highlighted how CAPCOM doesn't plan for any of its remakes to be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was an exception to the rule due to its scale, scope, and expectations.</p>
<p>As for why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero were chosen to be remade, the insider believes one of the reasons is that the improvements that can be made to the original versions allow for a more horror-focused design in the vein of the remake of the second entry in the series, which was a big success for the Japanese publisher. Other reasons include fan demand and, for Zero, the excellent timing. Many of the people who worked on it are still at CAPCOM or M-Two, and it is set to receive a live-action adaptation, which would definitely help the remake's popularity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE-Code-Veronica-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Closing their overview, Dusk Golem also commented on why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero may have been picked over the fifth entry in the series. The game has undoubtedly aged better than most of its predecessors, and it still feels great to play, reducing the need for a remake.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Resident Evil 4&nbsp;<span>remake, which is now available on PC, consoles, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ios-devices-require-internet-to-play-resident-evil-4-remake-and-resident-evil-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS devices</a>.&nbsp;</span>The remake does a great job improving one of the best games ever made without revolutionizing what made it great, although CAPCOM may have played it a little too safe, as highlighted in our&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror.980298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you long for the days when <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> had fixed camera angles and low polygon counts, <em>Heartworm</em> is just the game for you. <em>Heartworm</em> is authentic to the era it takes inspiration from and creates a nostalgic blast to the past with this survival horror title.</p>
<p>We checked out<em> </em>the PAX West 2024 demo of <em>Heartworm</em>, the upcoming game from developer Vincent Adinolfi and published by the horror fanatics at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp">DreadXP</a>. As they say, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so read on for our thoughts on what could be a strong spiritual successor to early <em>Resident Evil</em> games.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm - </em>is it Picture Perfect?</h2>
<p>I've made it clear thus far <em>Heartworm</em> takes inspiration from games like <em>Resident Evil</em>, so let's also emphasize the fact that it's a game with fixed camera angels, tank controls, puzzles, and door animations all. If you love that kind of stuff, <em>Heartworm</em> will no doubt strike a chord with you.</p>
<p>Though, it does enough to distinguish itself from its clear inspirations. Instead of guns, you have a camera. Back when cameras had film, y'know. So clearly, <em>Heartworm</em> takes place within or around the 90s and it's a great setting when combined with the dark and dreary horror this game portrays. This brings home that nostalgic feel.</p>
<p>Enemies are not zombies in <em>Heartworm</em>, insofar as I can tell; rather, they're these specters akin to static on an old CRT TV. They do bumble around like lethargic zombies before combat, but become a bit more tricky when they teleport around trying to take advantage of the player character, Sam.</p>

<p>One notable difference between this and other survival horror games, it feels like these ghosts require a lot more ammunition (or rather, film). The camera's almost assured to hit the target if you point in its general direction, but the trade-off is less damage. As a result, <em>Heartworm</em> emphasizes even more caution over which enemies you should kill, and which you should skip.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic with this concept. An old-school camera as a weapon is neat, but I worry it'll feel flat over time. Will there be other weapons, for instance? Or is the camera your sole tool in this spooky adventure? Regardless, my patience was put to the test when I fought a spider boss, which took far too many hits from the camera and felt too repetitive in terms of attack patterns.</p>
<p>But if it's environmental puzzles you're after, <em>Heartworm</em> does provide. Finding which key opens which door and exploring the entirety of a map is half the fun of survival horror, and that's apparent here. I started out in a dark neighborhood with these ghosts wandering around, but the horror takes a turn for the surreal.</p>

<p>I enter an apartment and the hallway is filled with snow. Opening a door in the apartment's hallway leads to an entirely new neighborhood, now filled with mounds of snow and new buildings. <em>Heartworm</em>'s level design looks to defy logic (in a good way) and surprise players rather than have it grounded in reality. Even <em>Resident Evil</em>, for all its body horror and zombies, was a bit more grounded.</p>
<p>All of this takes place within what is an absolutely stunning game. From an artistic standpoint, the old-school, 90s aesthetic of the graphics is replicated to damn near perfection. Every scene is like its own painting. I'm biased since I'm an absolute sucker for retro graphics in modern games, but this does not disappoint in the least.</p>
<p><em>Heartworm</em> is one of the most intriguing indie horror games in development right now, if anything for how true it feels to other old-school survival horror titles. It only needs to refine the combat a bit and make it a tad more exciting, chomping at the bit to play it when it comes out next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243763/astro-bot-sound-design-dualsense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is a game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">I cannot help but to evangelize</a>, raving about its cute characters, its bright and varied level design, and its short but dense 8–10 hour runtime. But perhaps the biggest element contributing to the game’s joyousness is its sound design, which makes <em>Astro Bot</em> something that engages and delights more than just your mind but your body as well.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> had me hooked before the game even started. I left my PS5 running on the game’s preload screen and was simultaneously soothed by calming bell tones and thrilled because the song conveyed a sense of imminent wonder. It sounded like something that would play in the opening sequence of a children’s movie, letting you know that an adventure was on the way. Music has a tendency to distract me as I’m working, but I let it play for hours because listening to it felt that good.</p><p>The music in the game itself is also banger after banger. I cannot get enough of hearing Astro sing in his little robot voice, “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=xXbVnnsmrO1-CFKz&amp;t=1">I am Astro Bot!</a>” His theme song is bouncy and happy and seems immune to the pitfalls typical of music geared toward a younger audience. “Baby Shark” is only cute the first couple of times you hear it, but I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old. “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=ZW7PhA35WkkPHrTw&amp;t=158">Astro</a>,” with its funky beat, is another song on my endless repeat playlist. Each level has its own song appropriate to its theme, but every so often, “Astro” will play, and I giggle longer and louder in those levels than anywhere else. I need this soundtrack on Spotify yesterday.</p><div><p>I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old</p></div><p><em>Astro Bot</em>’s incredible soundtrack is only half of the equation. The game also makes phenomenal use of the DualSense controller. As Astro moved about, I could hear the soft swish of grass or the hard clang of metal underfoot. The ability to hear environmental sounds emanating from the controller is not particularly new for the PS5, but what astonished me about <em>Astro Bot </em>was the sheer depth, detail, and quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture.</em> In one level, the sound and feedback from bouncing on a regular trampoline was so subtly different from what I felt bouncing on a hot air balloon that I could almost feel the texture of the nylon. In another, I could feel the rain pelting Astro’s metal body with a hard clink. But suddenly that sound softened and muffled with a light <em>whumpf</em> when Astro automatically deployed his umbrella. It felt like I was the one who hit the button on a real umbrella to do it.</p><div><p>[The] quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture</em></p></div><p>Perhaps the most magical thing about<em> Astro Bot</em> is the depth with which sound and the controller enhanced my perception of the game. <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537067/astros-playroom-ps5-dualsense-hands-on-preview">incorporated a lot of these same elements</a> and developer Team Asobi enhanced them greatly for the sequel. The controller acts as a bridge between the game world and the real one. I was delighted when I’d fiddle with the sticks or the buttons and those actions were mirrored on the controller in the game. When Astro rescues another bot, they get stored for safekeeping within the onscreen controller. But when I put my ear to my DualSense, I can hear their muffled little squeals, and when I shake it, the controller subtlely rumbles as though those little suckers <em>are actually in your hand.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worlds in <em>Astro Bot</em> are colorful and fantastical places but, through the player’s suspension of disbelief, are nevertheless entirely real. As I played, absorbing the sounds coming out of my controller, I had a revelation. Of course, there are logs of wood in the gardening world, but when I hit them, they made the distinct hollow noise that comes from striking two Lincoln Logs together. It made me realize that there are two games going on in <em>Astro Bot</em>. In one, I’m a little robot rescuing my friends. But in the other, I’m actually just playing with toys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The accompanying photos on the official site show the blocky bird-like Pokémon sitting with its owner on the floor as well as listening intently as its human tells it all their problems.</p><p>Notably, Porygon’s size has been inconsistent throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> series. The creature is composed of code that’s made its way into the real world, so it’s not bound to the usual rules of nature.

And let's not forget all the exclusives we're sure to see across PC and mobile platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Keeping track of all your anticipated games' release dates is a futile task without a little help, so GameSpot has broken down all the games planned for release in 2025. This includes games that have concrete dates, as well as those given a 2025 release window--for the latter, you'll find them grouped together at the end. We'll continue to update this post as more games are announced, both through the rest of the year and into 2025.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="January">January</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns/" data-ref-id="5000-78310">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> (PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, PC) - January 16</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-graces/" data-ref-id="5000-81570">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a> (Switch) - January 17</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cuisineer/" data-ref-id="5000-562988">Cuisineer</a> (Switch) - January 28</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="February">February</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> (PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC) - February 11</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> (PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, PC) - February 11</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phantom-breaker-battle-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-147998">Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds Ultimate</a> (PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, PC) - February 13</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> (Xbox Series X|S, PC) - February 18</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" data-ref-id="5000-612208">Lost Records: Bloom &amp;

        <p>"What's important to us is putting the games out that we want to put out."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda says game companies are too hung up on how their games perform on Metacritic.</p>
<p>Talking to our sister site, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Suda said that whilst he will check scores when a game releases - "Sometimes a media outlet has given us zero. That makes me feel shitty - why go that far and give us zero?" - but apart from that, he "tries to avoid Metacritic".</p>

<p>"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda said.</p>
<p>"If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic. The bigger companies might not want to deal with that kind of thing. That might not be the main reason, but that's certainly one reason why. Everyone cares too much about the numbers.</p>
<p>"Personally, I don't care too much about the Metacritic numbers," he added. "I'm not really conscious of them. What's important to us is putting the games out that we want to put out and having people playing the games we want them to be able to play."</p>
<p>Ed sat down with Suda and fellow titan of Japanese development Shinji Mikami at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> to talk about their work together, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-suda-on-shadows-of-the-damned-remastered-killer-7-and-a-sweet-home-remake">the importance of remasters as part of game preservation</a>, and if there are any games from their past they'd be keen to remake.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51-and-shinji-mikamis-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-out-this-halloween">remaster of 2011 action-adventure Shadows of the Damned is set to release this Halloween</a> on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's a cult-classic demon-shooting game written by Suda 51 and produced by Mikami.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CCP has announced its <a href="https://www.evefrontier.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new project</a> in the same universe as the well-revered <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-equinox-expansion-launches-on-june-11-eve-vanguard-gets-major-feature-update/">EVE Online</a>. This title, EVE Frontier, is being developed and published by CCP Games and is shaping to be a Sci-Fi Space Survival game. In this game, players explore a player-driven sandbox after waking up from stasis in the cosmos. To survive, players must explore the Frontier, which is chock full of resources to help advance in the game.</p>
<p>The Frontier is far from closed off. It's a shattered space region with dangerous supermassive black holes and Exotic wormholes scattered throughout. There will be other people to interact with, such as opportunists, speculators, and those desperate for power. Due to the Exotic wormholes bleeding Crude Matter, pilots are attracted to these wormholes as they can lead to significant wealth, prolonged survival, and technology enhancements.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official Teaser Trailer | 'Awake Eternally'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fgw44m1AdKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EVE Frontier has been designed to be an open environment. With "a complete unlock of third-party development, the game world will evolve with the community." Players will be able to influence the world with their in-game actions, and the worlds can also be edited server-wide by players in real time.</p>
<p>Using Smart Assemblies (blockchain technology) in-game, players can make their infrastructure offensive or defensively functional by using turrets, trading posts, and storage facilities. The sandbox features aren't the only thing players have to look forward to in EVE Frontiers, as there will also be intense Ship combat, which relies on skill and great tactician movements.&nbsp; Smart Assemblies utilizes <a href="https://redstone.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redstone</a>, which is an L2 blockchain which is designed for permissionless and open software, as well as <a href="https://mud.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUD</a>, which is a framework for building on-chain open applications.</p>
<p>It will become your mission to explore the Frontier, as well as gather supplies and resources to help you upgrade your infrastructure and technology so that you can continue to survive in the harsh atmosphere of the Frontier. It's described as "danger incarnate," filled with aggressive swarms of AI as well as other players who are willing to fight to the death. You have to try and beat them at their own game to harvest Crude matter to obtain fuel so that you can continue to expand.</p>
<p>At the moment, EVE Frontier doesn't have a set release date or price, and both are waiting to be announced in the future. However, what we do know is that it will be available on Windows PC and Mac. Whether it will come to other platforms in the future post-release remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-online-developer-ccp-sparks-backlash-with-crypto-blockchain-spin-off-eve-frontier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"None of us want this crypto slop…"</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> developer CCP has announced Eve Frontier, a spin-off of the much-loved MMO that adds controversial blockchain and cryptocurrency elements.</p><p>CCP describes Eve Frontier as an online space survival game with an open and persistent sandbox that focuses on “self-reliance, tactical and emergent gameplay, and third-party development.” Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Eve Frontier, CCP Games is creating a deep player-driven sandbox for a new era. Cast into a cruel and brutal cosmos, you have been lost to time and lost to light. To survive, you will need to explore, exploit and expand in the face of perpetual annihilation. The Frontier is a shattered region of space, warped by the presence of supermassive black holes gravitationally bound in a macabre dance. Rogue AI infests its depths; corrupting and consuming the remnants of what still stands.</blockquote><blockquote>With all players on one single-shard server, death and opportunity lurk in equal measure. Awareness is power: your skill as a pilot and strategic choices determine the outcome of every encounter, whether you favor hit-and-run tactics, stealth, or all-out warfare. Exploit the Frontier’s natural resources to upgrade your ship with vital technology and acquire new capabilities. Obtain fuel, the lifeblood of your journey, to power your travel as you overcome its dangers. A community-driven and dynamic economy allows you to create custom currencies, establish markets, and trade assets, services, and reputation in a truly open environment.</blockquote><blockquote>Rebuild civilization from its ashes by using Smart Assemblies, an open-ended platform, to construct and program infrastructure within space. Expand your influence through defenses, trading posts and multiple types of functionality, each imbued with a programmable layer that links the world of the Frontier to the real world outside of it. Develop your own ideas or address the needs of others: from mission systems to private economies, Smart Assemblies unlocks third-party development with a toolkit for creators to build beyond a virtual world.</blockquote><p>On the face of it, Eve Frontier sounds like an exciting alternative to Eve Online that could scratch a hardcore space survival itch, but the inclusion of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that has sparked a backlash from Eve Online players, some of whom have let CCP know how they feel across social media and subreddits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>CCP explains its use of crypto as supporting player ownership of items, with all transactions between players permitted outside and inside the game. Blockchain tech, CCP says, lets players edit aspects of the game world and server in real-time. CCP insists all this tech is environmentally friendly: “all technology used to develop and operate Eve Frontier has the same energy consumption as Eve Online’s infrastructure.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Blockchain and crypto has its time, and it is passed. Please. I beg of you. Don't destroy this amazing game you have created.</p></div><p>Despite these explanations, Eve Online players have reacted in horror at the announcement of Eve Frontier. Its subreddit is packed with complaints, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ffq63u/eve_frontier_why_tarnish_eves_name_more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player accusing CCP of tarnishing Eve Online</a>.</p><p>Another<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ff7ye9/dear_ccp_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Eve Online player called on CCP to cancel Eve Frontier</a>. “None of us want this crypto slop, this desperate cash grab, this attempt at ‘creating something great,’ WOLFWOLF68 said. “This game where buzzwords seem more important than gameplay.</p><p>“We love Eve. That’s why we still play it. None of us, through the memes and the laughs, want Eve to die. This ‘New Frontier’ is not Eve. It's everything bad about Eve, with even worse elements in it.</p><p>“It won't work. People wont play this. Blockchain and crypto has its time, and it is passed. Please. I beg of you. Don't destroy this amazing game you have created.”</p><p>CCP's X/Twitter post announcing Eve Frontier has sparked similarly vociferous responses from Eve Online fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>releasing a blockchain game a year after the weird hype about that technology died<br>so now you got a shitty concept and don't even get a pay-off for it</p><p>let's see how this is going to turn out :)</p></div>— Hannah / Nimos (@nim0s) <a href="https://twitter.com/nim0s/status/1834236985252130926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I initially liked this cos I like Eve, but just wanted to say I retract my Like because of the Blockchain nonsense, thanks</p>— Rob McLachlan (@robmclac) <a href="https://twitter.com/robmclac/status/1834273638825996713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Despite being over 20 years old, Eve Online retains a loyal fanbase and is still capable of housing incredible, community-driven stories. Eve Online is infamous for player heists, large-scale sci-fi battles, and for being so complex some of its players maintain multiple spreadsheets just to keep on top of things. Through all the ups and downs, CCP has struggled to create an Eve spin-off that has hit the same heights as its veteran MMO, with first-person shooter Dust 514 and VR game Eve: Valkyrie both falling by the wayside. Another Eve FPS, called Vanguard, is in the works.</p><p>As for Eve Frontier, CCP said it will reveal more later this year.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

That is no longer happening, Embracer announced. Now 4A Games, as well as Zen Studios, the Hungarian studio responsible for Pinball FX and Zen Pinball, will remain at Embracer.</p><p>In a statement, Embracer’s controversial co-founder and CEO Lars Wingefors said: “We are satisfied with the conclusion of this transaction and very glad to see the great teams and assets of 4A Games and Zen Studios remain within Embracer. They will be important building blocks in our continued journey.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>So, what’s 4A Games working on these days? It has VR spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metro-awakening-vr">Metro Awakening</a> due out later this year on PSVR2, PC VR, and Meta Quest, as well as the next mainline Metro game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game">confirmed to be in the works but yet to be revealed</a>. There’s another unannounced triple-A game in development at 4A Games, too, Wingefors teased.</p><p>As for Embracer, it’s coming out of a period of devastating cuts and studio closures that has seen thousands of staff lose their jobs. It also sold various parts of its business in a bid to improve its cash flow, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-from-embracer-confirms-development-on-new-borderlands-game">Borderlands maker Gearbox joining Take-Two</a>, and the aforementioned Saber Interactive going it alone.</p><p>Despite this, Embracer retains control of over 900 franchises, and owns the likes of THQ Nordic, Plaion, Coffee Stain, and Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics. Embracer, which also owns the rights to The Lord of the rings, has an incredible 103 internal game development studios, with more than 10,000 employees in more than 40 countries.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/what-we-played-wild-bastards-astro-bot-towerborne/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the fresh chill in the air, even when it’s been sunny this week, I’ve jetted off to a digital recreation of Hong Kong Island for a change of climate. It’s not really helped much, because there’s an awful lot of rain in Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, and obviously my actual body is still in the UK.</p>
<p>Still, Solar Crown is where I’ve been pouring most of my gaming energy this week, with an imminent review now that the game’s had its full launch.</p>


<p>Now, what have the rest of the team been playing? And as a Brucey Bonus, were they enticed at all by the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-reveal-launch-date-specs-confirmed/">PS5 Pro presentation</a>? I’ll get the ball rolling by saying that I’d be hard pressed to justify it, especially when I have a pretty competent gaming PC.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> hopped in to let us know he reviewed both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/wild-bastards-review-12-09-24/">Wild Bastards</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-review/">Quidditch Champions</a> for reviews, with a dash of Skull and Bones alongside – “Wild Bastards is excellent fun, and well worth anyone’s time.” As for the PS5 Pro, “it looks like too much money for too little difference to me.”</p>

<p>On the review ticket for <strong>Aran</strong> was NBA 2K25 and Beyond Galaxyland, which you’ll have to keep an eye out for next week. The PS5 Pro “is a hard pass for me, especially at that price. I don’t think it is a necessary upgrade either as it feels this gen is only really getting going.”</p>
<p>And it’s a no from <strong>Jim</strong> as well, who “could barely tell the difference between what was being shown during Sony’s technical presentation, so much so I almost thought it was a parody.”</p>
<p>He’s been playing Fallout: New Vegas and the Old World Blues DLC, which ” is some of the funniest I’ve encountered in a video game and gave me another “I get that reference, point at screen” moment when watching the finale of the Fallout TV show.” He’s closing in on the end of his adventure in the game though, so has balanced it with the brutal grimdark frenzy of Space Marine 2’s Eternal War PvP, and the pure delight of Astro Bot.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> also been enjoying Astro Bot, when not playing Dustborn for our upcoming review, and he’s thoroughly uninterested in the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>With the usual amount of spice to his gaming life, <strong>Steve’s</strong> played the “chilled out” Creatures of Ava, the “incredible” Astro Bot and the “superb” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>. He’s also been slowly working his way through the nostalgic Age of Mythology: Retold and is hoping to finish Golden Axe: Beast Rider this weekend.</p>
<p>“Oh and PS5 Pro; more like PS5 Hell no amirite?”</p>
<p>Having had a head start on the rest of us, <strong>Nic B</strong> has been chasing after the platinum trophy in Astro Bot, and was able to share his hands on impressions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> –”It has me both sharpening my Long Sword and polishing my Hunting Horn ahead of next year’s release. And no, those aren’t euphemisms, people…”</p>
<p>You can guess his thoughts on the PS5 Pro, by this point, and the same for <strong>Nick P</strong>, who’s been playing&nbsp;Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster for review as well as a bit of Aliens Fireteam.</p>

<p>And rounding things out for this week is <strong>Dom</strong>, who sadly had to put up with game crashes in Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown on Xbox, got to go hands on with the delightful <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/planet-coaster-2-preview-prepare-to-slip-and-slide-your-way-to-waterpark-nirvana/">Planet Coaster 2</a>, and delved into the simply gorgeous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/towerborne-early-access-review-gorgeous-goblin-grappling/">Towerborne</a> in Early Access. He’s also a nope for PS5 Pro, and he loves trading in old tech for new!</p>
<p><em>All of which brings us to you: what have you been playing? And have you stepped off the PS5 Pro hype train?</em></p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Realm of Ink&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC via Steam Early Access on September 27th, and although it's an Early Access release, it brings a surprising amount of content with it, so you shouldn't run out of things to do too quickly.</p>
<p><em>Realm of Ink&nbsp;</em>was originally due to land earlier this year, but was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2597080/view/4184484899721927332" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delayed back in May</a>&nbsp;for - you guessed it - polish reasons, with Leap Studio promising to use the additional time to create a "more complete version" of&nbsp;<em>Realm of Ink</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/realm-of-ink-early-access-release-date-world.jpg?itok=eW0j262L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/realm-of-ink-early-access-release-date-world.jpg?itok=0lQE2tZO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Realm of Ink&nbsp;</em>marries classical Chinese-inspired art with&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>-esque roguelite gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of this Early Access launch, you're getting "complete four-act levels and eight bosses", as well as the game's final boss, which is an interesting thing to include in the Early Access release.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Realm of Ink</em>'s Early Access release will offer nine distinct forms for protagonist Red, as well as more than 130 perks, full gameplay for several Ink Gems and Ink Pets, and "the first layer of world-building", plus "approximately 50% of the storyline".</p>
<p>Of course, over the course of&nbsp;<em>Realm of Ink</em>'s Early Access life, you'll get more stuff as well, with Leap Studio pledging to improve the game with "frequent optimizations and content updates". The developer estimates Early Access will last for around nine months.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, you'll probably get a kick out of&nbsp;<em>Realm of Ink</em>, but its art style is probably best seen in motion, so here's the release date announcement trailer for you to feast your eyes on.</p>

<p><em>Realm of Ink&nbsp;</em>is heading to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2597080/Realm_of_Ink/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on September 27th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive's new parent company Beacon has decided not to exercise its option for buying&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>developer 4A Games and pinball outfit Zen Studios, which means the two companies will stay with Embracer.</p>
<p>In March this year, Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-saber-interactive">announced its decision to sell off Saber</a>, granting Saber and its new parent Beacon (which is controlled by Saber CEO Matthew Karch) the option to purchase 4A Games and Zen Studios as well.</p>
<p>At the time, it was widely thought that Saber's exercising of this option would be a given, but Embracer has <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-receives-early-payment-for-sale-of-saber-assets-4a-games-and-zen-studios-will-remain-within-embracer-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now announced that the option has been cancelled</a>, indicating that Saber has decided not to go ahead with purchasing 4A and Zen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pinball-fx3-zen-studios-embracer-4a-games.jpg?itok=YNq6BEoy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pinball-fx3-zen-studios-embracer-4a-games.jpg?itok=8cJKLKvK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both&nbsp;<em>Metro</em>'s 4A Games and&nbsp;<em>Pinball FX</em>'s Zen Studios will remain under the Embracer umbrella.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says 4A Games and Zen Studios will be "important building blocks in [Embracer's] continued journey", and that 4A Games is currently working on "two AAA titles", which Embracer "eagerly await[s] to announce".</p>
<p>Presumably, one of those games is the next title in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, which 4A Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released">is still working on</a> despite its home country being torn apart by the ongoing Russian invasion. What the other one could be is anyone's guess, however.</p>
<p>Wingefors also gamely congratulates Saber on the "successful release of the iconic&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>" and thanks Karch for "his contributions over the years". It's nice to see execs getting along, I suppose.</p>
<p>Of course, it helps that this statement comes as Embracer receives $168.4 million for the sale of Saber and its related assets, with a further $28.1 million due "later in 2024 and 2025".</p>

The company has laid off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">hundreds upon hundreds of employees</a> over the last year or so, killing jobs at studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nearly-100-employees-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal-as-embracers-job-killing-spree">Eidos Montreal</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-strikes-again-as-more-layoffs-hit-lost-boys-interactive">Lost Boys Interactive</a>, and more.</p>
<p>It's all been part of a company-wide restructuring effort on Embracer's part, one that has also seen studios like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a> closed down, as well as the sale of outfits like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in"><em>Borderlands</em>&nbsp;publisher Gearbox</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what 4A Games and Zen Studios have in their pipelines, but presumably, Embracer will be banking on these releases to help it stabilize its income. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-ceo-is-unsure-about-palworld-going-to-a-live-service-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Could Palworld eventually become a live service game? That’s a question that Takuro Mizobe, CEO of developer PocketPair, is currently  going back and forth on in his head.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/220/4220741/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ASCII Japan</a>, Mizobe was asked about the future of one of the biggest gaming hits of 2024. The game dubbed “Pokemon with guns” launched to immediate success, and became the second-most played game on Steam ever before Black Myth: Wukong bumped it to three. </p>



<p>But now, nine months after the game’s launch, there are decisions that need to be made about where to take the game.  One of which is whether to take it to live service or keep it a buy-to-play title. </p>



<p>“To be honest, it hasn’t been decided yet,” Mizobe said. “We will of course add so-called general content. For example, we will create new maps and introduce new Pals there. We will also introduce raid bosses so that everyone can fight together, but for the future of Pal World, there are two options that are really important directions.”</p>



<h2 id="h-could-palworld-actually-go-to-live-service">Could Palworld Actually Go To Live Service?</h2>



<p>Going to a live service game, Mizobe says, would all the studio and game to have a more stable revenue stream and likely extend the life of the game as a whole. However, he was clear that Palworld wasn’t developed with live service in mind, which leads to difficulties in turning it into one.</p>



<p>“[T]he most important thing is whether the players want it,” Mizobe said. “As a prelude to a live game, it needs to be a F2P (free-to-play) game. It is common for game management games to make the game F2P and add paid elements such as skins and battle passes, but Palworld is a one-time purchase game, so it is difficult to turn it into a live game from the ground up.”</p>



<p>Mizobe added that PocketPair is looking into how they can bring in more players to the game while being loyal to its existing player base. He said that games like PUBG and Fall Guys are two good examples of games that moved from being paid titles to free-to-play games. That said, those games “took several years to shift”, Mizobe said, adding that it’s not that easy to turn a premium game into a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Do you think Palworld should go to a live service game or stay as is?

But at $700 —&nbsp;plus another $80 if you want to buy the disc drive accessory since the console itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">doesn’t have one</a> — a lot of gamers have been left wondering exactly <em>how</em> powerful it needs to be in order to justify the cost. </p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em>,</em> we try to figure out why the PS5 Pro has the specs and price tag it does and what this new console might tell us about the overall state of the gaming business. Around the same time as Sony’s announcement, Microsoft said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242695/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-650-employees">laying off another 650 Xbox employees</a> — these are two companies with very different ideas about the same business, and it’s not always obvious who’s right.</p><p>After we finish with our PS5 Pro chat, we talk about the other gadget news of the week. We also talk a bit about the reaction to Monday’s Apple event, after briefly forgetting that it happened this week at all. We discuss <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240700/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-tri-fold-price-launch">Huawei’s Mate XT</a>, the triple-folding smartphone that excited people in all the ways the iPhone 16 didn’t. We get very excited about the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24243230/google-android-desktop-window-resize-multitasking-tablets">multi-window future of Android</a>. And we consider two simultaneous Google stories: the excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the potentially company-shaking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240386/google-doj-ad-tech-antitrust-trial-court-day-one">ad tech trial</a>. Google is winning. Google is in peril. Google, as ever, continues to Google.</p><div><p>Finally, in the lightning round, we talk about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241047/nhtsa-rule-pedestrian-safety-fmvss-suv-truck-design">big trucks</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24242138/google-notebook-llm-ai-fake-podcasts-research">AI podcasts</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/6/24237753/whatsapp-messenger-third-party-chat-eu-dma">future of WhatsApp</a>, and more.</p></div><p>If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, beginning with the PS5 Pro:</p><p>And in other gadget news:</p><p>And in the lightning round:</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns"><h2>The entire staff of beloved game publisher Annapurna Interactive has reportedly resigned</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt"><h2>OpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‘reasoning’ abilities</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241047/nhtsa-rule-pedestrian-safety-fmvss-suv-truck-design"><h2>The US finally takes aim at truck bloat</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242497/ifixit-fixhub-usb-soldering-iron-station-battery-toolkit-price-release-date"><h2>iFixit made its own USB-C soldering iron, and it’s already a joy</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/28/4475682/phone-sex-number-accidentally-listed-in-the-last-of-us-ps3-game"><h2>Phone sex hotline accidentally featured in 'The Last of&nbsp;Us'</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
