		<p>Sony has announced the release date for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine/">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> game, which be created by Spider-Man developers, Insomniac.&nbsp; The game will launch on September 15th, 2026, exclusively on PS5 and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-1-marvels-wolverine/">number one in our “Most Wanted Games of 2026”.</a></p>

<p>“In this story, he is on the hunt to uncover the secrets of a dark past that keeps eluding him. Unfortunately, in this world, he’ll have to dig his claws deep to pull any shred of information that may lead to answers. Often, that means shredding into a relentless onslaught of enemies who aim to stop him by any means necessary,” say Insomniac.</p>
<p>Wolverine will, once again, be played by an Australian, this time, it is&nbsp; Liam McIntyre who is putting on the claws.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is being directed by Brian Horton (creative director) and Cameron Christian (game director), who were in charge of Spider-Man: Miles Morales and they have&nbsp;enlisted Walt D. Williams as story lead over at Insomniac Games. For those who don’t recognise the name, Williams worked as narrative director on 2012’s controversial <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/spec-ops-the-line/">Spec Ops: The Line</a>.</p>
<p>Why should gamers be excited for this news? Firstly, it underlines Insomniac’s intent to make Marvel’s Wolverine a game with a darker storyline, the developer having previously stated that it was aiming for a more mature tone compared to Marvel’s Spider-Man.</p>
<p>Aside from being a challenging third-person shooter with some interesting quirks, Spec Ops: The Line went rogue with its brutal, mind-being plot. Taking inspiration from Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (which also heavily influenced Apocalypse Now) the campaign saw three elite operatives infiltrate a ravaged Dubai to thwart a rogue U.S colonel in the midst of a sandstorm. It’s been almost a decade since the game launched on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, though we still remember the controversial white phosphorous scene as well as the four potential endings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162378/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The legends of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/caves_of_qud">Caves of Qud</a> stretch back into the ancient times, through mists of lore, to a moment of destiny. That’s right – all the way back to 2007, when American team Freehold Games began development on this ambitious roguelike RPG. After a 17-year journey to version 1.0 in 2024, gathering a devoted PC following, this intimidating, systems-heavy cult classic has rolled a new character on Switch.</p>
<p>The game is set in the post-apocalyptic, science-fantasy land of Qud. It’s populated by factions with either allegiances or animosities, ridden with organisms that either tolerate or seek to devour you, and driven by either rich spirituality or advanced technology. The either/ors are key, because whenever you start a run in Qud, it recalculates the decisions that set the whole scenario going. Your quest, as a new adventurer, is simply to get out there and survive in an exceptionally vivid open world.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162377/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before setting out, you must choose between two genotypes: mutated humans and true kin. Mutants possess biological traits like a beak or slime glands, while true kin are humans enhanced by cybernetics like night vision or dermal insulation. Mutants are more fleshy and vulnerable at first, with a latent power ready to explode outwards as they level up; the true kin start tough and precise from the early game, but feel more and more dependent on technology as the levels climb. The two options are distinctive and fun.</p>
<p>At this point, though, we need a reality check. “Yes,” you say, “I’ve read that there are three-armed mutants and winged cyborgs and a stunning open world – but I’ve also seen the screenshots! Aren’t we getting a little carried away?”</p>
<p>It’s true that this harks back to an era of astonishingly over-imaginative cover art and flickery ASCII graphics, but the effort to see the wonder in Caves of Qud is only needed for a few minutes. Barely has its stingy tutorial dropped you in at the (very) deep end when the efficient visual style and humour-lined, Hugo-Award-winning scenario reach out and grip you. The pixelated rectangular tiles that sometimes look like they <em>could</em> be ASCII writhe into life as robots and mysterious creatures. The sweeping music and ambient soundscape rouse into epic scores with triumphant melodies and the bustle of thriving towns.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162376/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And once you’ve leapt into the world of Qud, what happens? Well, anything, really. You’re free to play as you like, just aiming to survive and become part of its procedurally generated history.</p>
<p>You <em>won’t</em> survive, though. My first achievement was collected by dying. It’s simply called “Welcome to Qud”. And this being a true roguelike, when you see “You died”, that’s your lot. No save points; no meta-progression: back to square one. It’s sad when your level-10 mutant croaks it after several hours’ play, but it’s also just part of their story. Qud is about making stories, and in that regard, it’s excellent.</p>
<p>However, there’s more to Caves of Qud than just regenerated lore and maps. A human spine of authored content runs through the cybernetic flavour text from the algorithms.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162381/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Firstly, the basic topography of the world map is unchanging. This gives the sense of new progress made each time you restart – it’s the same world, so how long can <em>this</em> character live in it?</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a quest line that’s completely authored. This epic takes you through caves, markets, and townships, hunting artefacts and running rescue missions for droids.</p>
<p>Or does it? Given how much danger is out there in Qud, trying to follow a plot amidst it all is hard work. It’s one thing to lose a dozen hours’ playtime when it’s a throwaway run of survive-until-you-don’t. It’s another to say goodbye to this week’s questing, knowing you’ll need to replay from the start. There’s also a massive difficulty spike – an evil trap from the developers, you might even say – designed, surely, to kick your character’s bucket just as you feel you’ve surmounted the early game.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162380/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a grossly unfair dungeon, and given the roguelike rules, you’d better be in the mood to laugh it off and go again. (If you’re like me, you’ll fall for it repeatedly, finally clear it, after <em>many</em> hours, only to discover your character’s tongue has rotted and they cannot talk.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ingenious and fan-favourite edge cases of the deep system interactions — melting through walls, falling in love with inanimate objects, <em>becoming</em> formerly inanimate objects — are unlikely to come about without being forced into the dire straits of desperately keeping a run going.</p>
<p>There are additional play modes to address this. Besides “Classic”, there’s “RPG”, which lets you save your game at settlements – not ideal as these are infrequent stops on your quest. Rounding it out is “Wander”, which means most creatures won’t attack you and you gain experience through discovery, not combat.</p>
<figure><a title="Caves of Qud Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162382/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a real tension at the core of Caves of Qud: without the authored content, it would lose the wonder of uncovering a story, but without the roguelike rules, the elaborate mechanics don’t get a chance to play out. None of the available game modes really squares that circle.</p>
<p>However you look at it, though, Qud is massive. The map is expansive, the systems are ornate, and the lore is compelling even before all the generated embellishments. But the interface is <em>small</em>. Text can be enlarged only at the expense of the play area, which itself is most effective when zoomed in. I found a playable balance, but you’ll want to consider your setup: a bigger-screened handheld, a big TV, or a monitor-on-desk scenario would probably be best – the vestiges of Qud’s PC past are clear to see.</p>
<p>The control scheme, meanwhile, is clever – clicking or holding 'ZR' to pass turns becomes the main interaction and it’s satisfying. Given all the behind-the-scenes number-crunching that makes the systems run, load times can drag slightly, and occasionally this translates to sluggish movement as the game gets ready for your next turn, which is usually instantly available.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Caves of Qud has a devoted following for good reason. Its world is vivid despite its graphical style — the wonderful music helping out — and its rapid turn-based gameplay is addictive. The hardcore roguelike approach is brutal but makes each run special. This is at odds with the main thread of an RPG quest, which demands that every run is aimed at the same goal. However, that tension provides an energy that’s hard to resist. It’s compressed a little uneasily onto Switch, but can be made to work.</p>
<p>Maybe not legendary status on Switch, then, but a tale worth passing down to another generation of console players.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I need <em>Marathon</em> vs.<em> Arc Raiders</em> to be the <em>Battlefield</em> vs. <em>Call of Duty</em> of 2026. But which is which? There’s no standalone <em>Zombies Call of Duty</em> game, Activision claims. And another notable March release gets delayed to April. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>I think it’s time for every gaming CEO to put their gamer cred on the line. The head of Nightdive Studios has played <a href="https://x.com/pripyatbeast/status/2025968715289027064">over 8,500 hours</a> of <em>Dota 2</em>. Anyone willing to come out and admit to beating that? I’ve only got about 2,000 hours in <em>Dota 2</em> and I regret every one of them. But would I do it all over again if given the chance? Also yes.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> gets defensive about anti-cheat</h2> <p>Yesterday, Bungie’s imminent shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-is-already-improving-on-arc-raiders-in-one-key-area-2000672901">outlined a zero-tolerance policy for cheating</a>, unlike <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ escalating three-strike rule. In today’s patch notes for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPaKRV76Tlc">Shrouded Sky update</a>, the current extraction shooter king tried to explain its recent struggles with exploits. “When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection,” the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">development team wrote</a>. “Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time.”</p> <p>The note went on to try to expand on that complexity and scale. <em>Arc Raiders</em> leverages “broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques” to detect malicious behavior. But these systems are hard to develop and don’t offer “instant certainty” for quick bans the way “blunt software detections” do. Embark Studios says that this is why most of its bans operate on what I might call a cold, warm, hot scale.</p>

 <p>“Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior,” read the patch notes. But don’t worry! <em>Arc Raiders</em> is “tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement” so that “serious infractions now carry stricter consequences.”&nbsp;A dedicated anti-cheat team is working “tirelessly to keep the game fair.”</p>

 <p>Players will judge for themselves if one extraction shooter feels like it has fewer exploits and instant-kills. It’s nice to see some competition though. Like with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Black Ops 7</em>, a friendly rivalry forces everyone to up their game.</p> <h2>Activision shuts down standalone <em>Zombies</em> game rumors</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p> <p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Call of Duty</em> leaker&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/2025670143184101532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">TheGhostofHope</a> got the rumor mill spinning with claims that Activision was looking at possibly launching two separate games for the arrival of the next Xbox expected in 2027, including one that was a standalone <em>Zombies</em> mode spin-off. The official <em>Call of Duty</em> account responded by vaguely denying the claims. “The rumor factory working overtime,” it <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596">wrote</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report"><em>IGN</em></a>). “This ain’t it.”</p>

 <h2>The studio that made <em>Prototype</em> is back</h2> <p>All some gamers want is a remake of the 2009 action-adventure sandbox <em>Prototype</em>. Well, the developer behind it, Radical Entertainment, has reformed as New Radical Games according to the <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">studio’s updated website</a>. Microsoft currently owns the IP, so never say never, though I’m not sure going back to the well of a series that ushered in the studio’s closure is a smart move in the ultracompetitive landscape of 2026. Still, bringing back <em>Prototype 3</em>, canceled before Radical became a support studio for <em>Destiny</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1rcru49/comment/o70k5fc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">would be sick</a>.</p> <h2><em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> slips to April</h2> <p>Originally set to release on March 19, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-recap-xbox-october-showcase-game-pass-fbc-1851675394/6">1930s-style animated noir shooter</a> will arrive on April 16 instead. “As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make <em>Mouse: P.I.

              <p>Another one of Sony’s 2026 PlayStation 5 exclusives has a release date. Insomniac Games revealed that <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> will arrive on September 15. That gives the console’s tentpole first-party release plenty of buffer room, with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> coming two months later.</p> <p>“Let’s cut to the chase: <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> launches September 15, 2026,” the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insomniac.games/post/3mfmnbgtbbg2x">wrote on social media</a> on Tuesday. The unexpected timing of the release date announcement comes just a couple of weeks after the last PlayStation State of Play showcase in which Wolverine was notably absent.</p>

 <p>As Sony’s first-party pipeline has slowed during the PS5 generation, we’ve been getting about two big single-player PlayStation Studios exclusives a year. 2026 sees <em>Marathon</em> arrive in March followed by <em>Saros</em> in May. <em>Wolverine</em>‘s September release date puts it a month before Sony’s other fall console exclusive, <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>.</p> <p><em>Wolverine</em> getting a date this early suggests companies are taking Rockstar Games’ renewed commitment to launch<em> GTA 6</em> on November 19 seriously. With two of this fall’s biggest blockbusters now locked in on the calendar, other companies can start slotting in their release dates. Other big games like <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, <em>Control: Resonant</em>, and <em>Fable</em> are all still currently TBD.</p>

You'll need to have already signed up to the PlayStation beta program to take part (you can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jump in here</a>, if you haven't already), and seemingly be based within either North America or Europe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">North American servers will be live from 4pm to 7pm Pacific, while European servers will be up from 7pm to 10pm CET (that's 6pm to 9pm for the UK).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Content available in the playtest includes the hunters Sun, Rem and Axle, as well as two different game modes: the wave-based survival offering Machine Incursion, or the multi-stage dungeon exploration found in Cauldron Descent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is slightly odd that PlayStation is holding this test the same weekend it is already hosting its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> server slam, but perhaps it believes the pools of players for each will be limited enough — or distinct enough in terms of player taste — that it won't matter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony previously described plans for a "small-scale" closed playtest due at the end of February, alongside a few other details about the game. A tactical three-player co-op action title with a focus on adapting your Hunter for intense missions, the spin-off will also feature a narrative campaign that ties into the wider Horizon universe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Arjan Bak, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a story that "will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now. What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As of yet, there's no word on when that launch might be, or how the game will be monetized when it is ready for launch — whether it will be a premium launch or free-to-play.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend</link>
            <guid>1445077</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been nearly ten years since we last saw Max and Chloe together in a Life is Strange game. While the other entries in the series that starred other characters have been pretty good – in fact, its most recent entry, Double Exposure, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review"><u>excellent</u></a> thanks in part to its continuation of the core story of Max Caulfield’s complicated life with her even more complicated best friend Chloe – Life is Strange has nevertheless been missing that one thing that made the original episodic adventure so impactful. Now that the series’ co-protagonist (and sometimes antagonist if you really think about it) is back in the mix, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to not only be the game longtime fans have been waiting over a decade for, it also has the potential to be the strongest entry yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place immediately after the events of Double Exposure, Life is Strange: Reunion looks to wrap up Max Caulfield’s time-bending, dimension-hopping adventure by reintroducing the catalyst for the entire series. Chloe is back, and without getting too deep into spoiler territory, she's alive and trying to put the pieces together while Max is simultaneously dealing with the fallout from Double Exposure. While Reunion retains its signature indie sleaze aesthetic and at times eyebrow-raising dialogue (in an endearing way), the storytelling thus far is noticeably better than what we’ve seen from Life is Strange previously. There was a sense of urgency in the roughly two hours I had with the preview version, and I couldn't help but notice how everything had a melancholic vibe to it. The music, character interactions, and general vibe of Reunion makes it obvious that this final chapter in Max’s story is going to be darker and more emotionally charged than anything we’ve seen in a series that explores some pretty grim subjects.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Life is Strange: Reunion Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it's not all doom and gloom. The visuals are refined such that, to my eyes, a Life is Strange game has never looked better. The facial expressions and performances are excellent, the locations are full of clever environmental storytelling and charm, and every character is designed in a way that's brimming with personality and uniqueness. In my demo I was able to explore Max’s house, the Snapping Turtle, and a new location that reminded me of some of the more grim environments from the original Life is Strange. Conversations with characters felt more real, and while some of the dialogue was cringeworthy, it never took me out of the story like past entries have, and I'm happy to report that in my time with it, nobody said “hella”.</p><p>The world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, from some exceptional cues and nostalgic needle drops, the music, which is always a highpoint for the series, is definitely looking to be another highlight in Reunion. There was one needle drop in particular that tugged at my heart strings, and whether this was due to nostalgia or really good song placement (or both), it made me excited to hear what else Reunion has in store for Max and Chloe's latest adventure. The music, visuals, and environmental storytelling suggest that this is Life is Strange firing on all cylinders so far, and the world of Reunion feels more alive than ever.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, presentation isn't everything in Life is Strange, and Reunion takes the series back to its roots with Max’s rewind abilities and Chloe's backtalk choices. While I appreciated the newer dimension-hopping powers in Double Exposure, it was obvious from the get-go with Reunion that bringing back Max’s rewind power is the correct choice; it just felt right for the type of narrative-driven gameplay Life is Strange is known for. The few puzzles I was able to try felt natural and had more challenge than I was expecting. In one instance I had to defuse a room full of explosives before a short timer ran out. Admittedly, I died a few times while trying to find an optimal route between bombs, finding a pair of cutters, and avoiding falling objects. It was refreshing to have to solve a puzzle without it just being another standard <em>find the thing and pick the correct dialogue </em>event. That being said, there were still plenty of instances where I needed to talk to somebody, spectacularly embarrass myself, learn something about them, rewind, and try again. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Chloe’s gameplay, on the other hand, is less supernatural and more urgent. Unlike Max, she doesn't have any special powers and instead has to rely on her wits and quick thinking. Paying attention to the surrounding environment and remembering details from Chloe’s observations and conversations is integral here. When Chloe’s backtalk was prompted, I had to quickly make a dialogue choice and earn points over whoever I was being confronted by. If I made the correct choice when confronted by a security guard then I would win the conversation, if I didn't, then things wouldn't go my way. Adding this additional layer to Reunion’s dialogue choices is a breath of fresh air, since playing as Max can sometimes be a little too forgiving. I hope that we see this mechanic used more throughout Reunion, because its potential to force the player to make difficult permanent decisions without the option to magically rewind time could lead to some pretty interesting character outcomes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ dialogue is still a high point here, and I was given the choice to play with a specific set of outcomes from the first Life is Strange. While there is no canon ending to the first game, being able to pick my outcome from 2015 was pretty cool and has me excited to see what other outcomes and consequences the characters will face from that single choice I made a decade ago. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I only had about two hours with Life is Strange: Reunion, it was clear to me that developer Deck Nine is pulling out all the stops for the long-awaited finale of Max and Chloe’s story. The expanded gameplay, presentation, and overall vibe stands a good chance to become a series high point and hopefully lead to a fitting end to a story that's sat with fans for over a decade.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/life-is-strange-reunion-preview-like-meeting-up-with-an-old-friend]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Blizzard has announced a new game in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch/">Overwatch</a> franchise called Overwatch Rush, which is a new mobile game. The game will be a top-down shooter rather than first-person, and it is in the early days of development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Overwatch Rush | Early Development Gameplay Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_GNt0ILldw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Overwatch Rush is being developed by a dedicated team at Blizzard, separate from Team 4, all of whom have deep mobile experience,” say Blizzard. “Team 4 remains fully focused on Overwatch, which will continue to bring exciting and fresh new experiences for PC and console players in its recently launched Season 1 and beyond!”</p>
<p>“Overwatch Rush is an entirely new game – not a port – built specifically for mobile players. While there remains a lot of work to do, we’re eager to see how players enjoy what we’ve built so far, and to hear from them on what we should focus on in the coming phases of development. Our mission is to continue to expand the Overwatch universe by bringing fresh new adventures to players across all platforms. We’ll continue to keep you updated on how things are progressing.”</p>
<p>The team say they are “preparing for testing” in select countries and regions and interested players should join the <a href="https://discord.gg/overwatchrush">official Discord server.</a></p>

<p>Overwatch has just launched Season 1 which is a bit confusing considering it’s been out for years.</p>
<p><em>“For the first time in Overwatch history we’re telling a multi-faceted, fully-connected story across the entire year. You’ll experience a narrative arc with a set beginning, middle, and end, beginning with an all-new Season 1 through Season 6, before a new Season 1 launches in 2027. To tell this first story, we are releasing&nbsp;10 Heroes&nbsp;over the course of the year, with the&nbsp;first&nbsp;five&nbsp;joining the fight when&nbsp;Season 1 launches on February 10! Each of these new heroes will directly tie into the story for the year.”</em></p>
<p>So just to be clear, Season 1 has just started and runs the entire year until Season 1 starts in 2027.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-release-date-revealed-insomniac-games-september-2026/</link>
            <guid>1445050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Insomniac Games</strong> was done letting us wait, as it announced in a short and to-the-point post on its official social channels that <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> will release on <strong>PS5</strong> this coming <strong>September 15, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Let's cut to the chase</em>" writes Insomniac, before announcing the release date. While it's great to no longer be in the dark on the release date for what is arguably the most anticipated game coming to PS5 for <strong>PlayStation</strong> players this year, it is a little curious as to why we didn't get this news two weeks ago, when <strong>Sony</strong> held its first <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong>State of Play</strong> event of the year</a>.</p>



<p>You can try and play armchair executive and figure that Sony didn't want Marvel's Wolverine to overshadow the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/"><strong>God of War</strong> </a>news, but considering how early in development those remakes appear to be and the lacklustre response to the new <strong>Sons of Sparta</strong> game, it feels like adding this to the docket of announcements for the event wouldn't have made a big difference with how everything landed.</p>







<p>Regardless, at least we know when we can expect Marvel's Wolverine to arrive, and that it will (for now) be hitting its previously indicated release window of<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/"> <strong>Fall 2026.</strong></a> We haven't seen any new gameplay or heard any new official details about the game since that release window was revealed, so hopefully, this release date news is the indication that we're going to start seeing and hearing a lot more about this game.</p>



<p>Just ahead of the State of Play, Insomniac did indicate that we'll hear more about Marvel's Wolverine in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-unlikely-state-of-play-more-info-spring/">Spring 2026</a></strong>. It's clearly not Spring yet, so this is could also just be a bit of news to tide curious players over until after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-shows-off-more-saros-gameplay-at-the-state-of-play-ahead-of-april-2026-launch/">Saros</a></strong> is out, and to potentially appease players who might be concerned about the game actually arriving this year if we got to the end of April 2026 without at least a release date.</p>



<p>There's also the other angle to this, which is that this is a bit of good news for players to focus on as an attempt at distracting us from the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/">Sony closed <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong> just days ago</a>, for reasons that, realistically, boil down to the company's top brass, i.e. the now-retired <strong>Jim Ryan</strong> and the current leadership under <strong>Herman Hulst</strong>, grossly mismanaging the studio and its talent.</p>

            <p>
Is there something in the digital air this weekend? Bungie are finally letting anybody who wants a go have a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> from February 26th to March 2nd as part of the game's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-server-slam">server slam</a>, and now it looks like Guerrilla Games' recently announced live service spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-co-op-action-take-on-the-robo-dino-series-that-borrows-from-fortnite-hades-and-monster-hunter">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a> is joining it with a playtest of its own.
</p>
<p>
This playtest was already confirmed when the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-co-op-action-take-on-the-robo-dino-series-that-borrows-from-fortnite-hades-and-monster-hunter">announced earlier this month</a>, though now a hard set of dates have been set: February 27th to March 1st. However! There are several caveats to be aware of. The first is that you need to sign-up through PlayStation's beta program (which you can do so <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-hunters-gathering/latest-news-and-updates/">here</a>), and even then you aren't guaranteed a chance to try the game out.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hunters! 🏹 We know you've got questions about the upcoming playtest, so here you can find the most important answers to get you ready 🔽<a href="https://t.co/yh8MW6M9J9">https://t.co/yh8MW6M9J9</a></p><p>More questions? Drop them below, and our team will do their best to answers them.</p><p>See you in the Gathering, Hunters!… <a href="https://t.co/mKScAmnoAq">pic.twitter.com/mKScAmnoAq</a></p></div>— Horizon Hunters Gathering (@playhorizonhg) <a href="https://twitter.com/playhorizonhg/status/2026322950891118602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
A note on the game's playtest sign-up page does note that there will be more opportunities to try the game out in 2026, so don't go crying if you don't get picked. Another of said caveats is that it appears to only be running at certain times too, with a time slot of 7pm-10pm CET for those of us in Europe, and 4pm-7pm PST for those in North America. The test will be through Steam for us lot on PC as well, but obviously you can try it on PS5 too if that's your platform of choice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what's available to try out, there'll be three characters to choose from, a single explorable environment, and a couple of game modes, including the wave based Machine Excursion and the Hades-esque Cauldron Descent. You'll also be able to wander around the game's social hub area and test out some of the campsite customisation too (if you can find time considering you've only got three hours a day to try it out).
</p><p>
Obviously overall Hunters Gathering is looking quite different from its single-player predecessor, but we likely won't hear much about it this weekend as those chosen for the test will have to keep their lips shut (though I'm sure somebody will dish for their five seconds of fame). Mostly I'm confused as to why Sony would double up on playtests for the weekend, but hey, if they want to keep messing up their live service ambitions, that's on them.

<p>PlayStation has revealed the release date for Marvel’s Wolverine, and it arrives on September 15, 2026. </p>



<p>Marvel’s Wolverine is a highly anticipated game that players have been eagerly awaiting ever since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-leaked-wolverine-clips-show-off-gameplay-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insomniac leaks</a>. The excitement grew even more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when a brand-new trailer</a> was released in September 2025. Since then, fans have been waiting for one key piece of information: the release date. Fortunately, the developers have now provided that information as well.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-releases-in-september-2026">Marvel’s Wolverine Releases in September 2026</h2>



<p>Just a few months after Insomniac Games doubled down on the Fall 2026 release window for Marvel’s Wolverine, they finally have a release date. <span>A new post by the PlayStation account on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2026341407804330261" target="_blank">X</a>&nbsp;(formerly Twitter) reveals that Insomniac’s next superhero adventure is slated for September 15, 2026. Interested readers can wishlist the game now.</span> </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although not many narrative details about the game have been revealed, we have some insight into its plot. Wolverine is on a quest to uncover the mysteries of his past, willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. His journey is marked by brutal claw combat, intense rage, and unwavering determination, all aimed at discovering the truth about the man he once was. The game explores Logan’s darker, more brutal take on heroism, which is much different from Insomniac’s past games.</p>



<p>The gameplay videos have already showcased the fast and ferocious combat players can expect from the game. We also know about iconic Marvel characters who can be friends or foes; Mystique and Omega Red have been revealed so far. Additionally, the new adventure takes players around the world, allowing them to explore the island nation of Madripoor, the icy wilderness of Canada, and the bustling city streets of Tokyo.</p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-actor-confirmed-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the actor</a> for Wolverine was revealed in the previous trailer. Additionally, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-march-2026-free-monthly-games-headliner-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the headliner</a> for PlayStation Plus free monthly games in March 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Thanks to the massive success of Insomniac's Spider-Man games, its next project, Marvel's Wolverine, is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">easily one of our highest-anticipated games of the year</a>. Usually, every new piece of news about a game of this caliber would be closely guarded and revealed in grand fashion, but today's release date was a straightforward social media post. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/09/24/marvels-wolverine-comes-out-swinging-in-gameplay-trailer">After learning last year that it would drop sometime in fall 2026</a>, we just learned the official release date: September 15.</p><p>The news comes in a quick, six-second video posted to Insomniac's various social media platforms. Text above the video reads, "Let's cut to the chase: Marvel's Wolverine launches September 15, 2026." The video itself just shows the game's key art (which features the illustration of the titular mutant that appears on the game's box art) and text announcing the release date. Fans (like me) hoping this news would be accompanied by some more footage or gameplay details are sadly out of luck.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This is especially interesting timing given that Sony put on one of the biggest State of Play showcases we've seen in a while just a few weeks ago, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/11/marvels-wolverine-probably-wont-be-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play-and-heres-why">Wolverine was notably absent from the lineup</a>. This was not a surprise, as Insomniac suggested on social media that Wolverine wouldn't be shown, but it also teased a bigger look at the game in its most recent trailer, possibly hinting at a larger trailer or dedicated showcase coming this spring. That said, we're not complaining about the locked down release date, and look forward to seeing more of what the game has to offer in the coming months.</p><p>For more Marvel games, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-locks-in-an-august-launch-and-a-few-more-x-men">check out the recent X-Men-focused trailer for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>.

            <p>Marvel's Wolverine finally has a release date, and good news: it's coming out later this year.</p>
<p>Announced just a few minutes ago, the upcoming Marvel action game by Insomniac and PlayStation Studios will release on the 15th September, 2026. You can wishlist it now, if you're especially keen on it. This news also comes with an incredibly short <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2026341241936335224">release date trailer published on social media</a> - though if you were hoping for more gameplay you're out of luck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">The game bizarrely skipped the Sony State of Play earlier this month</a>, though this date reveal comes after a vague and mysterious <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">social media post by Insomniac</a> which stated we'd hear more about the game in spring 2026. There was also an open fall 2026 release window established relatively recently, which has as of today been narrowed all the way down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">The game was first revealed in 2021</a>, with a cinematic teaser during a State of Play livestream. Since then, it's been largely radio silent for the AAA super hero slasher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-later-playstation-and-insomniac-gives-marvels-wolverine-a-2026-release-window-debuts-trailer-full-of-blood-brutality-and-blades">save for a gameplay trailer released last September</a> which was packed full of action and gory violence.</p>

<p>Bethesda has released a new launch trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> on Switch 2, celebrating the release of what might be the ultimate version of the post-apocalyptic RPG.</p>
<p>It gives us a proper good look at some of the characters and locations you'll see on your journey through The Wasteland, and while the recent announcement trailer admittedly did little to excite us, this one is pretty darn cool.</p>
<p>The Anniversary Edition contains the main game itself along with six official expansions, including Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, and more. There are also over 150 Club Creation items included in the bundle, so plenty to tinker around with.</p>
<p>We'll have our own review of the game soon, so if you're waiting to see how it holds up on Nintendo's console, then we'll have all the answers for you. And after what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on Switch 2, you never know what to expect, hm?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition-jumping-into-2026/</link>
            <guid>1445002</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's that time of year again, as we're back to yet another <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> filled to the brim with demos of upcoming games, some of which could be some of the year's biggest games when they finally arrive. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">As I have done previously</a>, I've gone through a slew of demos that are available as part of the festival, and curated my findings into a list of a few that I highly recommend you spend some time playing throughout the festival's remaining run time. It's also worth noting that even if you don't catch this list until after the festival is over, it's up to the developers as to whether they want to take their demos down once the festival is over.</p>



<p>That means a lot of the demos that debut at Steam Next Fest will remain available to download and play long after it's over. So if something catches your eye, it's still worth your time to head over to Steam and see if the demo is still there for you to play. That said, if we have an indication from a developer that the demo will only be available for a limited time, I'll be sure to note it.</p>



<p>Before getting into the rest of the list, there are two games I got to check out ahead of their demo releases that I really wanted to take a bit more time digging into. The first was <strong>Luna Abyss</strong> from <strong>Kwalee Labs</strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/luna-abyss-hands-on-preview-doom-returnal-a-good-time/">you can check out my preview of that here</a>. The second was <strong>Zero Parades: From Dead Spies</strong>, the new upcoming game from the <strong>Disco Elysium</strong> studio, <strong>ZA/UM</strong>. You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-parades-for-dead-spies-hands-on-preview-za-um/">check out my preview of that demo here.</a></p>



<p>You can add both of those games to this list of recommendatinos, none of which are placed in any kind of ranking order. These are just 10 games I've played that are participating in Steam Next Fest that I absolutely recommend you check out.</p>



<h2 id="h-steam-next-fest-february-2026-edition">Steam Next Fest February 2026 Edition</h2>



<h3 id="h-replaced-sad-cat-studios-release-date-april-14-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/">Replaced</a> - Sad Cat Studios - Release Date: April 14, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REPLACED Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuUo7_VaboE?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starting with a game you've likely heard about, developer <strong>Sad Cat Studios'</strong> upcoming 2.5D pixel-art platformer, <strong>Replaced</strong>, has a demo that went live more than a week ahead of Next Fest, so if you already had this game on your radar, chances are you've checked the demo out. If you haven't or have never heard about Replaced before, then you should be sprinting to your Steam account to wishlist this game and add the demo to your library.</p>



<p>Replaced is not only one of the slickest-looking games coming; after getting my first hands-on with it through this demo, I'm extremely happy to say it's also one of the smoothest gameplay experiences. Admittedly, I do wish that your player character moved a little faster in between encounters, but their walk speed could get faster later in the game and is only that slow for the first mission, or there's a sprint function coming that we don't experience in its opening moments. </p>



<p>But that's a nitpick in the grand scheme of things, and while I was a tad <a href="https://wccftech.com/replaced-delayed-a-few-more-weeks-sad-cat-studios-cyberpunk-platformer/">disappointed to see it get delayed again recently,</a> that delay could be the thing that resolves those nitpicks. Replaced is one of the most intriguing narrative-driven platformers I've seen in a long time. Yes, I am an absolute sucker for platformers; I'd probably label them as my favourite genre of games, based on how much I enjoy them and how many I've played over the years. But with that experience, I would like to think I've developed a keen eye for which platformers have the sauce, and Replaced certainly seems to have it.</p>

<p>I know I just gushed about one platformer, but I'm going to gush about another. Not since <strong>Cuphead</strong> have I been so impressed with a game's animation and art style. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/">The Eternal Life of Goldman's</a></strong> cartoon-style storybook-themed game is overflowing with charm and is one of the most striking games I've ever played. </p>



<p>It's not just the visuals, though, that make it worthwhile. Even in the demo, I can already see how the game's platforming mechanics, specifically with how you swap different parts of your cane on the fly to change how you interact with the world, could make for some incredible platforming challenges. I can already see levels where you're paying attention to shifting platforms and environments while also ensuring to swap between appropriate cane parts to successfully make it through to the next section.</p>



<p>My one fear is that everything happening on screen could generate too much visual noise. While a large part of me is frankly still in awe over how impressive the art and animation are, I did have a couple of moments where I couldn't immediately recognize what was in the foreground and what wasn't. I hope that's something that doesn't continue to happen in the full game, or could be cleaned up ahead of launch. Still, I cannot recommend trying out The Eternal Life of Goldman enough. This game had my eye ever since its initial reveal, and even though this is just a demo, I'm happy to see that my first hands-on impression is as impressive as I hoped it would be.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: Weappy Studio has confirmed that the demo for The Eternal Life of Goldman will be up for a limited time beyond March 2, 2026 (the final date of Steam Next Fest), but has not given a specific date at the time of this publishing.</em></strong></p>

<p>Some games you just have to try after seeing them for the first time. That's part of the fun of Steam Next Fest - all the demos are free, and they're demos, so they're short. It's just a taste, and that could be all you ever want from a game, or make you hungrier. </p>



<p>I don't know where I've landed on Denshattack!. I might want more after some time passes, but on first glance and spending some time with the demo, I know that I'm very intrigued by it, especially as an <strong>OlliOll</strong>i veteran dating back to its original PS Vita days and an original <strong>Temple Run</strong> enjoyer. Denshattack felt like it was mashing those two games in a brightly coloured anime-style package while turning the speed up to 11, with a nod to <strong>Subway Surfer</strong> by making you play as an actual train competing against other people who race and do kickflips with trains, just cause it's cool as heck to do, instead of some miscreant running on train tracks.</p>



<p>On paper, and even on first glance, I thought it would instantly click with me. That's not the experience I had, but I've also not been able to stop thinking about it after sitting down with the demo for a lot less time than I spent with some of the other demos on this list. It feels great to play, it's extremely fast, and it's just too weird and fun to ignore.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: This demo is only available until March 2, 2026.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Planet of Lana II</strong> is everything I could have hoped it would be. After playing Planet of Lana for the first time in <a href="https://www.psu.com/reviews/planet-of-lana-review-ps5-ps4/">2024</a> with its arrival on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>PS4</strong>, I walked away from the first game in love with its art style and its touching core characters, but it was far too slow and repetitive. As much as I'm clearly a sucker for narrative-driven platformers, even ones that slow things down with more puzzle platforming like <strong>Limbo</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/inside-review-what/">Inside</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gris-anything-but-grizzly/">GRIS,</a></strong> and <strong>Neva,</strong> there just wasn't enough going on in the first game outside of its narrative chops to make it easy to recommend unless you're already tuned to enjoy these kinds of games.</p>



<p>The same cannot be said for Planet of Lana II, even in a demo that takes less than an hour for you to run through different snippets of the game. The puzzle platforming has clearly been given a huge upgrade, and there are a lot of interesting mechanics I'm hoping get combined in unique ways to create more interesting puzzles. If you fall into the same boat as me and generally like these kinds of games but didn't fully click with the first one, this is absolutely a demo you should check out during Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>Ensuring that this list isn't just chock full of games where jumping is your main action, <strong>Outbound</strong> is another game that slows things down in a different way. It is quite literally about survival-crafting your way through a never-ending camping trip after your player-created protagonist decides to drop life in the big city for the open and free outdoors. </p>



<p>It's just you and your camper-van, and at least based on the key art, a dog, at some point. You make your giant caravan your mobile home, and simply enjoy the change of pace and the view. You can play it with up to three other friends, which I'm sure will be a major draw when the game is out in full force. The amount of TLC you can give your camper-van as the game goes on honestly reminds me of <strong>Pacific Drive</strong>, another driving game that takes a very different turn with its survival-crafting-centred-around-driving approach.</p>



<p>A quick look through the screenshots on its Steam page reveals how much more complex the game gets compared to what you can experience in its Steam Next Fest demo, which is exciting to consider. That said, and I say this with full awareness that part of the point of Outbound is to slow down, it feels like it runs the risk of being too slow. At least for my tastes, and if this even remotely sounds like something you might like, I would still highly recommend giving Outbound a shot.</p>



<h3 id="h-mole-off-black-creations-release-date-q2-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4064510/MOLE/">MOLE</a> - Off Black Creations - Release Date: Q2 2026</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>Another game that's here to ensure that this isn't just a list of games where you jump, despite that being the front-loaded theme of it, is <strong>MOLE.</strong> As a fan of psychological horror games, this first-person horror adventure grips you right off the rip, setting up its dark and suffocating atmosphere that makes you feel like you actually need to hold your breath for fear of being caught by something lurking in the dark.</p>



<p>The idea that you're also digging further underground in a giant metal drill adds another layer to its environmental horror, intensifying the suffocating feeling. As scary as horror games set in space or deep underwater can be, there's just something far more tangible and relatable in a game about being deep underground. I also love how it's using its lighting - or more accurately, how it's using darkness - to keep the tension and your anxiety at a heightened level.</p>



<p>If you've played as many first-person horror games as I have, then you know it can sometimes be easy for these games to start off strong and fade out as they go on. Obviously, after just playing a demo, it's impossible to know if MOLE will fall in that category. But horror fans should definitely be keeping their eye on this game and check out this Steam Next Fest demo, to say the least.</p>

<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="GRIDbeat! — Indie Fan Fest Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2btGf5KPlI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>GRIDbeat!</strong> was one of the initial batch of nine games that publisher <strong>Acclaim</strong> revealed when it held its big comeback showcase back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/acclaim-returns-playacclaim-showcase-nine-titles-katanaut-launch-today/">September 2025</a></strong>, and it's the only game from that batch that has a demo in this festival, even among the few games from that batch that have already been released. </p>



<p>It's a move-to-the-beat-grid-based game that you can start flying through once you get the hang of how levels work, and the music is engaging enough to keep you head-bopping along while you solve the puzzle of how to clear the path in front of you to the end of the level.</p>



<p>The levels are fairly small and contained, which makes the pacing of getting through them as upbeat as the music. I really enjoyed how the mechanics evolved even in my time with the demo, and I hope the rest of the game only gets deeper from there.</p>



<h3 id="h-croak-woordrunner-games-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2616540/Croak/">Croak</a> - Woordrunner Games - Release Date: TBD</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>I know, I know. This list is officially half platformers. But this is arguably the best one (right alongside The Eternal Life of Goldman) if what you're looking for is something that is focused on how you move more than any other mechanic. Also, if it's any consolation, there are platformers I checked out that did not make the list, so these really are just the curated few I really enjoyed.</p>



<p><strong>Croak</strong> feels and looks great; I love how it uses spitting out your frog tongue as a way to launch yourself at a wall and bounce off of it, flying in the opposite direction. It's frankly hilarious to look at your frog being so bouncy and cheerful after smacking its face against a wall a hundred times, because I couldn't get a jump right as I adjust to the mechanics. I hope that the level design throughout the full game can match the charm coming off its character design and gameplay mechanics, because if so, this has the potential to be one of the most engaging and fun platformers of 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-big-bad-wolf-april-16-2026"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760560/Cthulhu_The_Cosmic_Abyss/">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> - Big Bad Wolf - April 16, 2026</h3>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The second first-person horror game on the list, <strong>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong> is on this list for more than just its spooky strength. There are a lot of investigation mechanics to wrap your head around, but altogether they seem to make the foundation for what could be one of the most interesting detective games out there.</p>



<p>I love how you can pin and keep track of clues, how you sonar out not just for any points of interest around you, but only for specific kinds of items you're looking for. How you only have a certain amount of what are essentially 'action points' to analayze items. For someone else, the manual and minimal approach might be limiting and frusturating, but for me the limits presented a more intriguing gameplay pitch than what you might find in something that is also trying to offer a solid puzzle-solving in a 3D space horror experience.</p>



<p>Now, its real test will be how it balances its horror elements with its puzzle solving. While it took me far too long to solve the opening puzzle, it dawned on me fairly quickly that this game could run into issues where the next 'horror' part won't actually kick in until you've solved what is in front of you, potentially breaking up the pacing in a way that could dramatically impact how you experience the next scene.</p>



<p>It's a 'me' issue that the first puzzle took longer that it probably should, I'm just hoping that the rest of the game will include puzzle sections that are better at weaving in the horror elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-armastus-counterplay-games-release-date-tbd"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660710/Armatus/">Armastus</a> - Counterplay Games - Release Date: TBD</h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Armatus | Demo Out Now Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hTCsnkI5xpw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Rounding out the list is something unlike the rest of the games here, <strong>Armastus</strong>. This third-person rougelike shooter from <strong>Counterplay Games</strong>, the people behind the PS5 launch title <strong>Godfall</strong>, is pretty much what you would get if you took the gameplay of <strong>Returnal</strong> and gave it the aesthetics of <strong>DOOM: The Dark Ages</strong> but set in Paris.</p>



<p>Initially revealed during an <a href="https://wccftech.com/godfall-developer-counterplay-games-debuts-armatus-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a> last year, as someone who loves Returnal, this game instantly caught my eye, and after having played the demo I'm glad it did. Now, as is the case with all of these games, these demos are not the full picture, and there's always a chance these games fall off after the promising potential shown in these demos.</p>



<p>But Armastus feels like it has a solid-enough gameplay foundation that whether the story is able to keep me awake or not, the gameplay certainly will, and so far it feels like a strong blend of third-person shooting and rougelike mechanics. If it's even half as good as Returnal overall, it'll be one of the best games of 2026.</p>



<hr>



<p>Those are my Steam Next Fest recommendations for the February 2026 edition of Steam's demo lolopalozza. There are still plenty more demos to check out through the rest of the week as the festival continues, so let us know waht you're enjoying in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Guerrilla Games</strong> has announced that it will host the first <strong>closed playtest</strong> for its recently announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/"><strong>Horizon-</strong>based co-op multiplayer game</a>, <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>. Curiously, it's the second playtest being run this week for a <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> title, since <strong>Bungie's</strong> open server slam test for <strong>Marathon</strong> is <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">also taking place this weekend</a>. But at least in the case of Horizon Hunters Gathering, it's a closed-beta test you have to be invited into, so they theoretically won't cannibalize each other.</p>



<p>That said, it still feels odd that <strong>Sony </strong>would opt to have them on the same weekend. Regardless, if you head to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/beta-program-at-playstation/">PlayStation Beta Program</a> page, you'll be able to sign up for a chance to participate in the closed playtest for the new multiplayer Horizon title if you want to play it on your <strong>PS5</strong> console. If you're on PC, then you can just head to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4244910/Horizon_Hunters_Gathering/">Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>Similar to other closed beta tests, just registering for it doesn't guarantee you a spot. Once you've registered, you'll be sent an email (or not) letting you know how you can participate in the playtest with a code to download the beta test on your preferred platform.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>As for what you'll get to experience in the playtest, should you be chosen to participate, the test will include three playable heroes: <strong>Axle, Rem,</strong> and <strong>Sun</strong>. You'll choose one of these characters for two different mission types, <strong>Machine Incursion</strong> and <strong>Cauldron Descent</strong>, both of which will be hosted on only one of the maps included in Horizon Hunters Gathering, <strong>Colorado Springs</strong>.</p>



<p>The test will officially kick off on <strong>February 27, 2026,</strong> and run until <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> which is right in the middle of Marathon's test that runs from February 26 to March 2. Let us know which of the playtests you would choose if you had the chance to play both.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s producer Alexia Christofi has spoken about the game's meta-progression overhaul, which needed a rework following player-feedback shortly after the game's launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/battlefield-6-s-meta-progression-needed-a-little-bit-of-a-rework-says-producer?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Speaking to Game Developer at DICE</a> earlier this year, Christofi told the outlet about the team's approach to making substantial changes to how players unlock weapons and other in-game items through challenges in Battlefield 6. Their initial approach faced criticism after many found the requirements too daunting or unrewarding.</p>
<p>Players didn't like feeling they were forced into specific modes," Christofi stated. "We took a step back, re-evaluated, and as we're launching future seasons, we've changed our ethos a little bit to challenges and player progression in general."</p>
<p>Following this shift in approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">meta-progression requirements were drastically reduced</a>. Within a short period of time, what was once difficult became far easier, allowing players to unlock specific tools in a relatively short amount of time, without feeling the frustration of a long grind or arduous task. This, according to Christofi, has influenced other aspects of the game experienced today.</p><p>"There have been times when I've woken up in my morning, we've seen something, we've got some bugs we need to fix for the next patch, and we haven't got around to fixing it by the evening... and then we've been able to hand it over to someone in LA to take that on and carry on working on that," Christofi explained.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-first-reactions">Battlefield 6 players are entrenched in the game's second season</a>, which added a new map as well as various other activities to engage in. There's also the game's battle royale mode — RedSec — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-redsec-battle-royale-makes-me-miss-peak-pubg">which was initial received with mixed reception from players and critics alike</a>. This too, has undergone a suite of changes and tweaks in response to feedback.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to play Battlefield 6 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>. In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a> wasn't exactly what we were expecting when we first heard about Guerilla Games tackling an online multiplayer Horizon game for Sony, but the PS5 and PC "tactical co-op" title certainly looks interesting to enough to warrant a closer look. Now, it appears the first closed beta test is about to happen, and its timing is a bit funny.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/wait-some-fans-will-be-playing-horizons-divisive-ps5-pc-multiplayer-game-this-weekend">Push Square</a> and social media posts, we've learned the first Horizon Hunters Gathering test will be happening during certain time slots this weekend. More specifically, from 7:00pm to 10:00pm CET in Europe, and 4:00pm to 7:00pm PST in North America; it'll "get underway from 27th February and run until 1st March." At the time of writing, it seems other regions are not part of this test.</p>
<p>To access, you'll need to both be part of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?">PlayStation Beta Program</a> and get lucky. The good news is the closed test seems substantial, as it'll include access to three different characters: Axle, Rem, and Sun. Two modes, Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent, come with this test, which will happen exclusively "on the previously announced Colorado Springs map." Moreover, the Gathering social space and a customisable camp site will also be available, which suggests development on the game is further along than many thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sony and Bungie will be hosting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Marathon's "server slam" weekend</a> to test the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">online infrastructure</a> ahead of its launch on 5th March. Unlike the closed Horizon Hunters Gathering test, Marathon's pre-release weekend is free for everyone and open, so we're gonna assume Horizon's little event is <em>really </em>limited when it comes to player numbers, as overlapping them (and the ensuing conversations) seems a bit silly.</p>
