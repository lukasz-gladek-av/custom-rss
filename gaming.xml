		<p>There has been a dearth of games based around surfing, but it looks like Double Stallion Games is out to rectify that with its new co-op action RPG called Surfpunk. In Surfpunk, players take on the role of Raiders in the ruins of the The Fallen World, which is a flooded anime inspired world. The aim is to jump on your Rushboard to explore, scavenge, and fight.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surfpunk - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63j0Mo0mXFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The main reason for scavenging in Surfpunk is to find and secure a resource known as Evress. Evress is the energy source that powers everything in the world, and it comes from the ruins of the ancient world. It is not all easy as otherworldy creatures know as Sumi will attack players as time progresses. That means exploration in some areas is time limited, meaning players will have to make choices on what to loot and what to leave behind, before the Sumi become aware of their presence and attack. The world will change with each run as the islands are randomly generated with fresh enemy encounters. There will be a crafting mechanism allowing players to craft armour, and gear like ladders to reach hard to reach areas. On the co-op side, players can team up and explore the world as well as participate in PvE raids.</p>
<p>Surfpunk has been confirmed for PC, but a release date has not been set. The PC requirements have been stated, and those can be seen below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203663/evo-2024-recap-street-fighter-6-street-fighter-third-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201924/how-to-watch-evo-2024-schedule-twitch">Evo 2024</a> wrapped up late Sunday night with Victor “Punk” Woodley beating Adel “Big Bird” Anouche in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23741204/street-fighter-6-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>. With his victory, Woodley became the first American to win a mainline <em>Street Fighter </em>tournament at Evo in over 20 years.</p><p>The match was nail-bitingly close with Anouche, who made it to the grand finals via the loser’s bracket, beating Woodley 3-0 to reset or “flip” the bracket requiring another best-of-5 match to determine the winner. Their second match went the distance, with each player having two set wins a piece and tied 1-1 in the final match. A well-executed super move from Woodley’s Cammy ended the match and America’s long <em>Street Fighter </em>Evo championship drought along with it. </p><p>Americans actually fared exceedingly well at Evo 2024, taking home championships in four of the eight main tournaments: <em>Street Fighter 6 (</em> Victor “Punk” Woodley), <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>(Dominique&nbsp;“SonicFox”&nbsp;McLean), <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising </em>(Aaron&nbsp;“Aarondamac”&nbsp;Godinez), and <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> (Shamar&nbsp;”Nitro”&nbsp;Hinds). </p><p>Additionally,<em> Street Fighter 6</em> wasn’t the only <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament at Evo where memorable moments were made. Over in the <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> tournament, <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/Hayao">Hayao</a>, a player from Japan, memed his way into our hearts with his infectious enthusiasm and over-the-top celebrations. During one celebration, <a href="https://x.com/Scollomania/status/1814817168887832875">he bent his body clean in half</a>, touching head to floor in a pose only characters from <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> seem capable of. In another, he bust it open on the main stage completing a full split — notable, as Hayao is 41 years old.</p><p>But Hayao cemented his place in the Evo history books with playing skill. During the loser’s quarterfinal with only a pixel’s worth of health, Hayao pulled off an astounding parry — <em>in</em> <em>mid-air — </em>then deftly sailed over his opponent’s follow-up super attack to come back and beat his opponent, advancing to the next round. </p><p>Hayao unfortunately didn’t win the tournament, falling in his next match to finish in fourth place. But his incredible display of skill was so electrifying that some are referring to it as “Evo Moment 38,” or the spiritual successor to <a href="https://youtu.be/JzS96auqau0?si=L1jF7xHb3b1ZdldL">Evo Moment 37</a> — perhaps the greatest clip of fighting game competition of all time. Even though he didn’t win, Hayao still <em>won</em>.</p><p>There was a smattering of other hype Evo 2024 moments. Twitch streamer LilyPichu won a <em>Tekken 8 </em>show match against the game’s producer Katsuhiro Harada. <em>Tekken 8</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/QZWDIKKvNrc?si=KLIM7NLtl_9CVKjX">resurrected the franchise’s longtime villain Heihachi Mishima</a> despite Harada remarking more than once that the character was well and truly dead. Evo also plans to add two new events in 2025 with the first <a href="https://www.evo.gg/news/the-evo-awards-powered-by-qiddiya---coming-february-2025">Evo Awards</a> taking place in Los Angeles and Evo France, marking the tournament’s first appearance in Europe. Evo is already the biggest, most exciting fighting game tournament in the world, and it’s good to see that it continues to grow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is also getting a ranked mode.</p>

<p>Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5AtpYPz2Ic" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.</p>

<p>MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/check-out-the-jokers-multiversus-gameplay-and-the-batman-who-laughs-alternate-costume">The Joker</a>, The Matrix's<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/20/multiversus-launch-trailer-reveals-jason-voorhees-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith"> Agent Smith</a>, and Friday the 13th's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/jason-voorhees-gets-a-dedicated-multiversus-trailer">Jason Voorhees</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pokemon-spt/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-now-catch-%E2%80%98em-all-in-escape-from-tarkov-spt.933903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pokemon-spt/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Escape from Tarkov has a single-player mod-driven ecosystem called SPT. It was popular long before Battlestate Games introduced the same thing with the new ‘PvE’ mode, but the core difference is that SPT can be further modified and manipulated. </p>



<p>Recently, one modder introduced a Pokémon-themed mod to Escape from Tarkov’s SPT mod platform. It allows players to collect 156 unique cards and compile them into binders, fusing them with boosters and – best of all – display them in a new section added to the player hideout.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-the-very-best">Be The Very Best</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is synonymous with challenge, difficulty, and gruelling FPS-fuelled intensity. It’s one of the toughest games on the market, and it doesn’t hold the hand of new players <strong>one bit</strong>. While SPT is a little complex to get running, it offers unparalleled customisation opportunities for players who want to have a different experience free from the risk of potentially running into other gamers.</p>



<p>This new mod (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/someones-added-collectible-pokemon-cards-to-escape-from-tarkov-single-player-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up by Destructoid</a>) brings a quirky cosmetic pack into Escape from Tarkov SPT. It’s called Collectables: Pokémon Cards, and when twinned with the <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2132-collectables-pok%C3%A9mon-cards/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collectables: Card Case Mod</a>, it becomes a mission for players to go out and catch ’em all. It’s impossible to know when you’ll stumble upon a card, and as they’re randomised, it could theoretically take weeks to find them all – provided you’re searching in every container and corner of the game.</p>



<p>Trading card packs and the unique cards themselves have been added to the game as 3D renders, which means you can preview them in all their replicated glory in the item menu. Given how rigorously Nintendo defends its IP, it might only be a matter of time before the mod is ordered to be taken down, but until then, it’s live and ready to be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</p>

Games has officially acquired Player First Games, adding the developer behind MultiVersus to its profile.</p><p>In an official release sent to IGN, Warner Bros. confirmed that co-founder Tony Huynh and Chris White will retain leadership of the studio, which has led development of the popular Smash Bros-like brawler. Multiversus officially launched in May following early access and open beta releases throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said in a release. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p><p>The announcement came ahead of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-season-2-to-add-samurai-jack-and-beetlejuice-ranked-mode-arrives-next-week">release of MultiVersus Season 2</a>, which is set to go live tomorrow. In addition to ranked mode, the new season will add Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. They join a host of other Warner Bros. characters, including Agent Smith, Joker, and more.</p><p>Reviews of MultiVersus have been mostly positive since its release, with our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review-open-beta">own review stating</a>, "MultiVersus is a raucous and fun competitive platform fighter that rewards players for learning the strengths and weaknesses of its eclectic cast of characters and working as part of a team. Its focus on online 2v2 means it lacks the pick-up-and-play nature of a game like Smash Bros., but it also does a nice job of setting it apart from other games in the genre. MultiVersus may need time to grow its currently limited selection of stages and characters to meet its bright potential, but its foundations are already rock solid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Warner Bros. Games president David Haddad said in a statement, "We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games. The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities."</p><p>Player First Games joins a studio line-up that also includes NetherRealm Studios, TT Games, Monolith Productions, and Avalanche Software. Warner Bros. Games was recently hit by layoffs amid the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-mobile-game-to-shut-down-a-year-after-launch-as-developer-netherrealm-suffers-layoffs">closure of its Mortal Kombat: Onslaught mobile game</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League also struggling since release</a>. Despite that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-says-it-plans-to-double-down-on-live-service-despite-suicide-squad-failing-to-meet-expectations">Warner Bros. Games has said it will continue to double down on live service games</a>, which includes MultiVersus.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

As you follow the winding paths along the snow-capped peaks, you'll eventually reach the Foot of the Forge Site of Grace. Just beyond, you'll see a red-haired titan who awaits you in its arena.</p><h3 id="General_tips_when_facing_the_Fire_Giant">General tips when facing the Fire Giant</h3><ul><li>The Fire Giant is one of the largest bosses in Elden Ring. Expect its attacks to be slow and cumbersome, while packing quite a punch.</li><li>Most blows will take out a chunk of your health. We recommend being level 115 or higher, with at least 40 points in Vigor. (Note that 60 Vigor is the ideal cap that you should reach.)</li><li>Additionally, talismans that increase your HP, such as the Crimson Amber Medallion and Erdtree's Favor, are viable as well.</li><li>As the name implies, the Fire Giant does have several fire-based abilities. The Flamedrake Talisman (or other higher-tier variants) is an extremely useful accessory to have.</li><li>Similarly, you can make use of spells like Flame Fortification or Flame Protect Me, as well as the Fireproof Dried Liver consumable.</li><li>In our case, we preferred the Eleonora's Poleblade to inflict the bleed status effect, though many other armaments should suffice. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-best-weapons-tier-list-per-type/2900-5612/" data-ref-id="2900-5612"><strong>best weapons guide</strong></a>.</li><li>Alexander can be summoned as an NPC ally, but his summon sign is in the boss arena itself. You may also use spirit ash summons, preferably the Mimic Tear, Black Knife Tiche, Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff, and other single entity specters that are armored or are fast enough.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336511"></a><figcaption>Mount up on Torrent to get closer to the Fire Giant, but be sure to avoid its devastating plate sweep attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Fire_Giant_boss_fight__Phase_1">Fire Giant boss fight: Phase 1</h3><p>The start of the Elden Ring Fire Giant boss fight is actually the most pivotal moment in the whole encounter. The arena is vast and this behemoth is far in the distance. Ideally, you should ride Torrent to close the gap, but beware of the boss' plate sweep attack. This attack can kill Torrent and your character outright. However, if you double-jump on Torrent at the right time, you should be able to avoid taking damage.</p><p>From here, it's imperative that you fight the Fire Giant on foot--its melee/physical damage abilities can kill Torrent and you don't want to waste your flasks reviving your trusty horse. The idea is to focus on its left leg, hitting it continuously until your foe kneels in anguish. Here are some other things to watch out for:</p><ul><li>If you're locking on to the Fire Giant's left leg and you see the monster lifting it up, that means it will smash the ground with its metal plate. Make sure you roll to avoid this crushing blow.</li><li>Speaking of rolling, the Fire Giant will sometimes roll to reposition. Don't forget to close the gap when it does.</li><li>The boss will launch a large, slow-moving fireball. You can let it get close enough until it pulses, then run away before it detonates.</li></ul><h3 id="Fire_Giant_boss_fight__Phase_2">Fire Giant boss fight: Phase 2</h3><p>At roughly 50% HP, a cutscene will show the Fire Giant breaking off its leg and offering it as a sacrifice. From here, it becomes less mobile but it does gain a few new abilities:</p><ul><li>The boss will shoot out two slow-moving fireballs this time. You can still go near them and quickly run away to trigger their explosion. Aside from this, it also launches fast-moving fireballs in a straight line.</li><li>It will belch out multiple burning rocks that explode once they hit the ground. This ability tends to have a long cast time.</li><li>Fire pillars will also erupt around it as it's kneeling.</li></ul><p>During the second phase, your best bet is to mount up on Torrent and stay behind it. You can then use your melee weapon to strike its right leg (i.e. the one that it didn't break off). This can take a while since this isn't its weak spot, so make sure your preferred melee weapon is upgraded.</p><p>Alternatively, those who prefer ranged combat or spellcasting should focus on the Fire Giant's hands (i.e. the actual weak spots). This can be riskier since you have to avoid several projectiles. However, you can use the trees or rocks as cover, but watch out if they get destroyed. Lastly, if the boss gets staggered, you can run up to it to deal critical damage to its eye.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336512-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336512-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336512"></a><figcaption>For melee fighters, it's better to stay behind the Fire Giant so you can keep hitting its leg during the second phase.

This can be exchanged with Enia at the Roundtable Hold for either of these two rewards:</p><ul><li>Giant's Red Braid:  <ul><li>Type: Whip</li><li>Skill: Flame Dance</li><li>Scaling: Str D, Dex D, and Fai D</li><li>Attribute requirements: Str 18, Dex 12, and Fai 21</li></ul></li><li>Burn O Flame:  <ul><li>Type: Incantation</li><li>Effect: Lets you cast a magic spell similar to the Fire Giant's fire pillars</li><li>Attribute requirement: Fai 27</li></ul></li></ul><p>That does it for our guide on how to beat the Fire Giant in Elden Ring.

		<p>A major new free update for Sker Ritual has been released by Wales Interactive, and it is called House of the Damned. The House of the Damned content leads with a new map, which this content drop is named after, but that’s not all. There’s new weapons and cosmetics to get your hands on too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sker Ritual - House of the Damned Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qW-SLp-qH6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One the new weapons in Sker Ritual will be The Rattler, which unlocks when the new standard weapon, Pistolet Stamped SMG, reaches Tier 3. The new special weapon is called The Corpse Grinder, and it is exclusive to the House of the Damned map, though some may get lucky in different maps to wield it. It’s essentially a shredder that cuts through flesh and bone, but it can only be accessed after completing the main EE mission. There will be 20 free new rewards added to the Sker Pass, on top of a premium DLC pack. This premium DLC pack will include two wolf masks, a black and white animated menu background, a new voiceline, and a premium emblem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/20/sker-ritual-takes-the-world-of-sker-in-a-new-and-unexpected-direction/">Sker Ritual takes the world of Sker in a new and unexpected direction</a></h2>
<p>Sker Ritual is a spin off from Maid of Sker, swapping the atmospheric horror for a wave based first person shooter. Steve played Sker Ritual and said, <em>“Sker Ritual is a completely unexpected game in almost all regards and that includes how much fun it is. I was fully expecting to find the shift to wave-based shooting a betrayal of everything that made Maid of Sker distinctive and interesting, but the actual experience of Ritual is just simple shooting fun and I found myself enjoying it a lot.”</em></p>

Warframe fuckers stay winning, I guess.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,196251,196395" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During a lengthy presentation at the con, Digital Extremes finally provided an honest-to-goodness look at Arthur, <em>Warframe 1999’</em>s protagonist—voiced by gaming’s new golden boy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-best-clive-yuna-cloud-squall-16-rpg-1850627323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-best-clive-yuna-cloud-squall-16-rpg-1850627323"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a></span>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">Ben Starr</a></span>—as well as his supporting team, the Hex. The Hex make up what <em>Warframe</em> calls a syndicate, but what we might call a faction. <em>1999</em>’s “syndicate” consists of Amir Beckett, Aoi Morohoshi, Quincy Isaacs, Leticia Garcia, and Eleanor Nightingale, who appears to be Arthur’s sister.</p><p>Onstage, the developers announced that they wanted players to be able to “get a little closer” to this syndicate than they have to others that have been added to the game. As a result, <em>Warframe 1999 </em>is packing an entire romance system, and any of the Hex, including Arthur, can be romanced. Yes, you read that right, you <em>can</em> romance Ben Starr in this game, and maybe even get a New Year’s kiss from whoever you go all in with.<br></p><p>In keeping with its 1999 setting (specifically New Year’s Eve of 1999, leading up to 2000/Y2K), the expansion will convey this romance system via instant messaging. Prior to the meaty action section of the demo, Arthur hops on a PC in the abandoned shopping mall that the Hex calls a base and boots up a chat client called KIM, which is followed by a horribly accurate dial-up sound.<br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, KIM looks eerily similar to AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) in its early days, and not only features pop-up chat windows but also usernames and notes that may as well be bios and statuses. When the demo player opened one of the Hex’s profiles, a gift icon could also be seen, indicating that the relationship system may take some cues from games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, where gift-giving can help endear you to other characters. Otherwise, KIM looks like a carbon copy of the messaging programs of yesteryear, and I swear to god, if I hear the sound of a door closing as someone logs off, I’m going to sue for emotional damages.<br></p><p>After years of AAA game developers and publishers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/palworld-makes-the-most-familiar-april-fools-joke-of-them-all-with-a-cursed-dating-sim-announcement-pals-take-off-their-clothes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/palworld-makes-the-most-familiar-april-fools-joke-of-them-all-with-a-cursed-dating-sim-announcement-pals-take-off-their-clothes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joking about adapting their established franchises</a></span> into visual novels and dating sims—often around April Fool’s—it’s refreshing to see a game as large as <em>Warframe </em>treat it seriously enough to add it as a feature in an expansion. Though it’s not yet clear how deep the system goes, the pops from the crowd at Tennocon seem to suggest that fans of the game, especially the most devout, really want a system like this. Digital Extremes could’ve thrown some of that <em>Warframe </em>money to outsource a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-hooked-on-you-dating-sim-visual-novel-1849378475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-hooked-on-you-dating-sim-visual-novel-1849378475">(bad) dating sim</a></span>, but it didn’t, and I think that’s worthy of being lauded.<br></p><p>The delightfully retro expansion to <em>Warframe </em>doesn’t stop there. Throughout the 22-minute demo, there are flashes of a boy band called On-lyne. The demo literally opens on an On-lyne commercial, and ads for them appear around town as Arthur rides a motorcycle around <em>1999</em>’s new environment. A banner for On-lyne even makes a brief appearance at the bottom of the KIM client. As it turns out, Digital Extremes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665">borrowed a page from Riot Games</a></span> and saw fit to make an <em>actual </em>90s-style boy band and stick them in the game. There’s even a single that’s out right now, called “PARTY OF YOUR LIFETIME,” and you can actually stream it. No shit folks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listen to this thing</a></span> and tell me it doesn’t sound like Backstreet Boys’ “Larger than Life,” or some cut track from <em>No Strings Attached</em>.</p><p>Though you don’t get to see them in their prime in <em>1999</em>, On-lyne appears to make a greater appearance in the current <em>Warframe </em>timeline. Once the demo cuts forward to a more current Tenno in their ship, they pick up the signal of a concert that seems to be happening smack in the middle of outer space. Once the player reaches the stadium, a host of pods hanging above release a handful of bodies onto the stage, revealing that the boy band have become Infested, one of <em>Warframe</em>’s enemy factions.</p><p>Unfortunately the action cuts short just shy of the actual encounter, but I’ve seen enough. I’ve never played <em>Warframe </em>before, and I absolutely do <em>not </em>need any more service games to play, but I want to romance the hot cyborgs, zip around town on a sick motorcycle, and dance with the pretty boys to catchy anthems. Deep down, you know you want that too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, gamers have taken to the internet to voice their concerns and opinions about certain titles and the developers that make them. It’s no big secret that an angry mob of gamers can bring down the sentiment of any title by launching a crusade against said game, making a vast effort to ‘review bomb’ a title based on <strong>anything</strong>. It could be an update they don’t like or a promise broken by a developer, but these days, the concept of the ‘review bomb’ is all too commonly seen.</p>



<p>Speaking candidly in a recent SEC filing, Take-Two Interactive, the parent of Rockstar Games and publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, spoke about the harm that review bombing has on a company or a franchise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-defamation-campaigns">‘Defamation Campaigns’</h2>



<p>In the recent 10K annual filing, the leadership team at Take-Two Interactive highlighted review bombing as a very real threat, opting to be a little more professional and brand the practice as ‘defamation campaigns’.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen some developers buckle under the weight of review-bombing efforts – Helldivers 2 is probably one of the best examples of a game that was horrifically review-bombed this year. It’s not fair to say it doesn’t work, as in that particular scenario, changes that caused the negativity to rise in the community were reverted based on Helldivers 2 receiving hundreds of thousands of deliberately poor reviews.</p>



<p>Here’s what Take-Two’s leadership team wrote in the recent SEC filing that was <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by Game File’s Stephen Totilo</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, obtaining and maintaining high ratings of our games on the third-party platforms on which we operate are important as they help drive players to find our games. If the ratings of any of our games decline or if we receive significant negative reviews that result in a decrease in our ratings, our games could be more difficult for players to find or recommend. In addition, we may be subject to negative review campaigns or defamation campaigns intended to harm our ratings. Any such decline may lead to loss of players and revenues, additional advertising and marketing costs, and reputation harm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the run-up to the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, this could be Take-Two Interactive preparing shareholders for a potential ‘defamation campaign’ aimed at Rockstar Games because of <strong>something </strong>in the game. Perhaps it’ll be ‘too woke’ for some players, or maybe it won’t have the right networking features or in-game mechanics for others. That’s all it takes at times – developers are forever walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>Skull and Bones is coming to Steam next month. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has announced that the ship-combat game is joining the platform on August 22. The release comes 6 months after the game’s initial release.</p>



<p>“Setting sail with Skull and Bones on Steam this August 22!” <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1815431945972531384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft said</a>. “Get ready to navigate the ruthless high seas, engage in brutal naval battles, and build your own empire.”</p>



<p>Skull and Bones is an online “naval action RPG” that sees players “rise to become the most fearsome pirate kingpin.” The game was based on the naval combat of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-release-date-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched February 13, 2024</a>. The release came after years of development and multiple delays, including a full reboot. The game features cross-platform play, and is also available for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In order to play the game on Steam, players will be required to always be online and have an Ubisoft account. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Spiritborn Class Impressions | Diablo 4 Vessel Of Hatred Preview</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few clues as to why this might be the case. Spiritborn gameplay footage shows XP bars post-level-50 without the Paragon Point unlock nodes seen in the current version of the game. Instead, it looks like players may earn Paragon Points each "level" after max, in a way that could be closer to how players earned Paragon points in Diablo 3. That being said, it's unlikely players will be able to earn "infinite" Paragon Points like in Diablo 3, as that would require Blizzard to completely rework Diablo 4's existing Paragon Board system.</p><p dir="ltr">Other evidence suggesting a new, lower max-level is an in-game tooltip that states the amount of armor players will need at level 60. In the current game, the tooltip references the amount of armor needed at level 100. The healin- potion upgrades from the Alchemist shown in the Spiritborn gameplay footage is another indication, with the new upgrades looking like they will cap out closer to level 60 instead of level 90 like in the current game.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the max level and Paragon changes looks to be a damage-number squish. It's something many players have requested given that damage values in Diablo 4 can currently be in the millions or even billions, making them extremely hard to read and requiring bosses to have health in the trillions in order to compensate.</p><p dir="ltr">Those requests look like they've been heard, as players have noticed from the Spiritborn gameplay that not only do the level 30 Spiritborn characters seem to be dealing far less damage in terms of raw numbers than is typically seen in the current game, but that items themselves--like a recently showcased Spiritborn Unique weapon--have much lower damage values than in the current version of Diablo 4. Gameplay likely won't be affected much by this change, as enemies will still die and take damage at the rate they currently do, but the numbers displayed themselves will likely be much lower (and easier to parse) come Vessel of Hatred.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that Blizzard has not officially detailed these changes as of yet, so all of the above has simply been pieced together by the community with available evidence. We will know more once Blizzard spills additional details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred closer to its October 8 release</a>.

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly exploring several different new tiers for Xbox Game Pass, including ad-based and cloud-exclusive ones. The previous Game Pass family plan might also be coming back too.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is working towards a cloud-only version of Xbox Game Pass that is cheaper than an Ultimate tier subscription. This tier is focused on users who aren't interested in owning an Xbox console. Subscribers to this tier reportedly would also have the ability to "double dip" with their games, meaning that they can play via the cloud and be able to own them digitally.</p><p>As for an ad-based tier, Microsoft is reportedly only exploring that option rather than actively working towards it. This tier would be aimed at users who don't want to spend money on Game Pass at all, but still want access to its games.</p><p>Back in 2022, Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-bundle-officially-confirmed-by-microsoft/1100-6507083/" data-ref-id="1100-6507083">announced</a> that it would be testing the Game Pass Friends &amp; Family Plan in regions like Ireland and Colombia, where up to four people could share one Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

		<p>Guilty Gear Strive’s season 4 has been announced and released today, adding four characters, two stages, and two new colour packs, with one being a seasonal pass bonus. It has been priced at £22.99. One of the characters takes the honour of being the first every crossover character in a Guilty Gear game, and that character is Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime based on Cyberpunk 2077. In addition, from Friday 26th July an open beta for a new mode called Team of 3 will be launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Season Pass 4 Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2_pb6LiRmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of the four characters coming as part of Guilty Gear Strive Season 4, Dizzy will be the first to arrive, and the only one of the four releasing in 2024. <strong>Venom </strong>will be the second character to be added, and will be coming in 2025, followed by Unika&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;anime, and finally Lucy&nbsp;from&nbsp;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>The Team of 3 mode, as you may have guessed, pits two teams of 3 players against each other in online matches, with each player assigned the role of either Main or Assist. Assist players support the Main with different skills and strategies. The role of Main can be assigned to any player at any time. The beta of this mode will only last until July 29th. This is an open beta so anyone can play, even if they do not have a copy of Guilty Gear Strive.</p>

<p>In our Guilty Gear Strive review, Miguel wrote, “<em>Guilty Gear -Strive- excels in all the areas you’d expect it to – the music is sick, the characters look crazy, the fighting is fun, and May players deserve nothing. It’s an old dog that’s been taught new tricks, and all of those tricks are rad as hell. At the same time, it feels like it can be so much more. The story mode is clunky and the Online Mode can use some work, but I’m sure as post-launch support ramps up we’ll see stellar improvements to both those fronts.”</em></p>

            <p>
The internet was all in a flap last week after Microsoft promised to place <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-deadpool-bum-controller-as-competition-prize-for-one-lucky-recipient">Deadpool's pert posterior</a> into the hands of a lucky few by way of a new limited edition controller. But if red spandex doesn't do it for you, there's now a <em>second</em> superhero butt in town, courtesy of a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/22/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-wolverine-design/">bright yellow, Wolverine-themed</a> Xbox Wireless Controller.
</p>
<p>
Both controllers (as you've probably already guessed) have been created to promote Marvel's upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie, which arrives in cinemas across the world later this week. And to coincide with its release, there's a global sweepstake going on at the moment via Twitter/X for anyone wanting to get their hands on those superbuns.
</p>
<p>
Full <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/promotions/deadpool-and-wolverine-sweepstakes">rules</a> can be found on Microsoft's website, but the gist is you'll need to follow the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox">official Xbox account</a> then repost one of its designated promotional posts containing the hashtag #xboxcheekycontrollersweepstakes before the competition closes on 11th August.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Double_Controller_WV_16x9-372d7db385e6875b79af.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Microsoft is being pretty tight with its butts, and only one winner will walk away with Deadpool and Wolverine's plastic posteriors when the competition ends. On the plus side, that same winner also gets a (regrettably bum-free) Xbox Series X console inspired by Deadpool and Wolverine, plus a matching custom Xbox Series X stand.
</p>
<p>
Still, early word from one Deadpool controller recipient <a href="https://x.com/jacobkleinman/status/1814351005439402133">suggests</a> the butt, much like a real butt, is held on with magnets and has a tendency to drop off in moments of vigour - so entrants probably won't be missing out too much if they don't win.

In other bum-related Xbox news, Microsoft's Halo TV show has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-divisive-halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons">cancelled after two season</a> by Paramount+, despite giving everyone a look at Pablo Schreiber's Master Cheeks back in its first year. If only it had got its own promotional butt controller, eh?

And according to a source, a Game Boy Advance port of this cult classic Rockstar game was nearly finished before being canceled.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Released in October 2005, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rockstar-had-planned-a-spiritual-successor-to-the-warri-5792730&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-had-planned-a-spiritual-successor-to-the-warri-5792730"><em>The Warriors</em></a></span><em> </em>was a faithful adaption of the original ‘70s film about a small gang having to make their way across a treacherous New York City and back to their Coney Island home after being framed for murdering a popular criminal leader. It featured gritty action set in a dirty and dangerous NYC. The game captured these vibes perfectly, even bringing back some original actors to voice their characters. Sadly, the Xbox 360 was released a few weeks later and overshadowed the already niche game from Rockstar. But over the last 20 years, the game has developed a cult following and is seen by many as one of Rockstar’s best creations. And according to a new report, we almost got a GBA port of this underappreciated brawler. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recently,<em> Time Extension</em> reported</a></span> that while talking to a former Rockstar Games developer, they learned about the existence of a <em>Warriors</em> GBA port, something that was previously undocumented. <em>The Warriors</em> did receive a PSP port, but sources told the outlet that Rockstar was originally planning to port the game to Nintendo’s popular handheld device using the same engine the company used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its well-received <em>Max Payne</em> GBA port</a></span>. </p><p>“We were going for four-player co-op using the link cable and stuff.

<p>Death Stranding both confused and amazed gamers worldwide when it was released exclusively on PlayStation 4 in 2019. It puts players in control of Sam Bridges, a delivery specialist in a bizarre, post-apocalyptic world haunted by ethereal, otherworldly beings. It’s enough to say it comes from the stunning mind of Hideo Kojima – that tells you all you need to know about the ambition and innovation of the story.</p>



<p>When it was released, many joked that Death Stranding was little more than a spooky walking sim, or more accurately, a delivery boy simulator. Well, thanks to a new mod that hit Nexus yesterday, you <strong>can finally </strong>play Death Stranding without many of the game’s threats, delivering your piles of packages without being plagued by BTs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remove-the-threat-remove-the-point">Remove The Threat, Remove The Point</h2>



<p>Death Stranding is nothing short of bizarre. The player uses a baby in a chamber that can sense BTs (‘Beached Things’) and other threats to avoid impending doom, and ‘Timefall’ regularly scours the land, causing things to age dramatically fast, eradicating the player’s constructs and eroding their cargo. </p>



<p>In this new mod that was released yesterday on Nexus – ‘Live Stranding’ – players can manipulate the game and remove almost every trace of Timefall and the BTs that come along with it. This means that gamers are left to explore a vast open world relatively undisturbed by enemy forces or troublesome weather. It removes much of the point of the game, but it’s great if you <strong>are </strong>looking for a delivery boy simulator.</p>



<p>Sadly, the mod that’s hosted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding/mods/51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Nexus Mods</a> isn’t a cakewalk when it comes to installation. There are a few things you’ll need to do as prerequisites to installing the mod itself, and as it’s <strong>brand new</strong>, it’s bound to be buggy. </p>
