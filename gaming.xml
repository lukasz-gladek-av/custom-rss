The first of these, <em>FEAR</em>, is now in.</p><p>Meanwhile, 2004's <em>Silent Hill 4</em> has joined the program with the addition of “restored scenes that were never available on PC before,” according to a press release from GOG. This includes missing “hauntings,” the strange events that occur, which GOG found were in the PC code but never included—their engineers have dug them out and got them working.</p><p>Alongside those two headliners are some other classic games that could easily merit the same moniker. Stone-cold classics like <em>Deus Ex</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption</em>, <em>Alone In The Dark 1</em> to <em>3</em>, and all eight original <em>Ultima </em>games are also now included, meaning they will be constantly maintained to work on modern PCs for as long as GOG exists (and, the company told me, it has plans in place to ensure preservation can continue if it was to go away). Oh, and Crystal Dynamic’s first three&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raiders</em>.</p><p>Here’s the full list of new additions. It’s worth noting most of these are currently at least 75 percent off in GOG’s current sale:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_redemption&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_redemption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade -

<p>Final Fantasy 14 is gearing up for the colossal 7.2 update titled Seekers of Eternity. Square Enix isn’t content to sit around and leave us all wondering though. The developer has already showcased the preliminary patch notes revealing much of what’s to come in the update.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-seekers-of-eternity-7-2-update-reveals-many-changes">Final Fantasy 14 Seekers of Eternity 7.2 Update Reveals Many Changes</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-quest-to-complete">New Quest to Complete</h3>



<p>A ton of new quests have been added requiring the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-launch-trailer-tells-us-more-about-the-expansions-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawntrail expansion</a>. This includes Main Quest missions, Chronicles of a New Era quests, side missions, and more.</p>



<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

<figure><figcaption>A wealth of content. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thanks to Square Enix, we have the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/ad533b893feebc1a06995b73a33497345dfcd8aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update patch notes</a>. Here, you can see every single change, which piece of DLC you need to benefit properly, and what to expect overall.</p>



<p>This should keep Final Fantasy 14 fans ticking over until the 7.3 update and the eventual successor to Dawntrail.</p>

		<p>It’s a great time to be a driving game fan, with 2025 already hotting up with the arrival of games like Wreckfest 2 and Assetto Corsa Evo. Firmly on our upcoming radar is JDM: Japanese Drift Master, which might boast a Ronseal-styled name, but which is looking absolutely incredible, especially if you have any interest in the Japanese drift scene (watching Fast &amp; The Furious: Tokyo Drift doesn’t count, Initial D does).</p>
<p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | Eurobeat Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFOkWEiIhIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer shows off more of the drifting action as racers slide their way through neon-infused Japanese cities and towns through to the beautiful, traditional countryside. The team have used their own photos, as well as images lifted from Google Earth to truly capture the look and feel of the country, something that it looks as though they’ve absolutely done.</p>
<p>This new trailer features an exclusive Eurobeat song that’s been written for JDM: Japanese Drift Master. Called LIFESHIFTFIRE!, it’s an electrifying Eurobeat track composed by Kamil Hasselhoff, Naski, and Marga, and it made its international debut during the Future Games Show. Music looks to play an integral part in the game, and in keeping with the drift scene, it’ll bounce between Eurobeat, Dance and Nu-Metal while you’re trying to achieve drift supremacy.</p>


<p>There’s a fully featured story mode here, and you’ll play Polish driver Touma, a new entrant on the scene. It’s up to you to take him from a nobody to the drift master, and there’s a great bunch of licensed cars from manufacturers like Nissan and Mazda in which to do it. JDM looks like it should be fairly welcoming too, with a Simcade driving setup that will give you heaps of control, without being too exacting.</p>
<p>JDM: Japanese Drift Master is due to arrive on the 21st of May, and will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48?__cf_chl_tk=b5um8CjyirgFe0bmT1hc5EMp5tCkEheD_xZPmT01ybw-1742556033-1.0.1.1-H9l41dC590rpjYP0w1iB5coAWf3qRK_AtPiNvYL45T4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master">GOG</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows reached an important player number milestone on its first day of availability, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours after the latest entry in their series launched on PC and consoles, the publisher confirmed the game had passed 1 million players. While it's not clear how many have accessed the game via a Ubisoft + subscription, this is definitely an excellent result which bodes well for the upcoming weekend, when the number will likely get higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's not even 4PM here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!</p>
<p>Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you! 💝 <a href="https://t.co/1cqwABrQfN">pic.twitter.com/1cqwABrQfN</a></p>
<p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While not exactly attempting to push the boundaries of the open-world RPG formula established by Origins, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a more than worthy new entry in the series. Despite its often inaccurate recreation of Feudal Japan, it attempts to bring back stealth gameplay into the spotlight while not doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, making for a surprisingly varied experience. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-movie-could-make-a-great-co-op-caper">Split Fiction Movie Could Make A Great Co-op Caper</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Imagine what the power of modern cinema could do. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Netmarble Neo announced that the action/adventure RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will debut on Steam Early Access in just a few days, on Wednesday, March 26. This follows the demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-pc-demo-out-now-on-steam-full-release-in-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went live last month</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. Clearly, the developers received positive feedback and are ready to move on with the next step.</p>
<p>The game is planned to be in early access for at least four weeks, which would be an unusually brief timeframe. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store page</a> provides several details on how the early access version will differ from the full release:</p>
<p><em>Much of Westeros will be available to explore during the Early Access phase. Players will be able to visit the major cities such as Winterfell, King's Landing and Highgarden and visit the surrounding areas. The Early Access version contains 50 chapters of the main storyline, hundreds of side missions and open world encounters, multiple co-op dungeons, and endgame PVE challenges. During Early Access, players will begin their journey in the northern regions of Westeros, exploring iconic locations such as Castle Black, Winterfell, and areas beyond The Wall, eventually making it to The Reach.</em></p>
<p>Following the early access phase, Netmarble will expand into the Stormlands region to introduce additional areas for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad players to explore. These new areas, such as Storm's End and Felwood, will feature new open-world content, new quests, and co-op dungeons. During early access, the developers will gather feedback to further refine elements such as game balance, graphics, UX/UI, and more.</p>

<p>While the full game will be free to play, to play Game of Thrones: Kingsroad during the early access phase, players will have to purchase one of the Founder's Packs. The Standard Pack is priced at $24.99 and includes a Northern Outfit, the Emoji Pack - Jon Snow, and 350 Iron Bank Marks of currency. The Deluxe Pack is priced at $49.99 and includes the aforementioned in-game items plus the Battle Pass Premium, Wandering Crow Outfit, Darkcloud Mount, Nameplate Background: Ghost, Nameplate Frame: Harbinger, 750 Iron Bank Marks, and 50K Copper.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Founder's Pack" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgbRj-GotBo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Ultimate Pack is the most expensive at $89.99, adding access to the Battle Pass Premium+, White Fang Mount, Brotherhood Without Banners Reins and Saddle (Horse) and Brotherhood Without Banners Saddle (Direwolf), Nameplate Background: Iron Throne, Nameplate Frame: Conqueror, 2K Iron Bank Marks and 200K Copper.</p>

            <p>Six years ago Nightdive Studios announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/20-years-after-release-system-shock-2-is-finally-getting-an-enhanced-edition">doing a remaster</a> of sci-fi sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, which they were calling System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition. But back then they were also busy working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">full-blown remake</a> of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a>. Turns out that first outing to Citadel Station took priority. But now that they're done with that, the studio has finally revealed a release date for the sequel's remaster, which they've sneakily renamed System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. </p>

<p>It's coming out June 25th this year, as revealed by Nightdive in the above trailer shown during the Future Games Show's spring showcase. As you can see this is definitely "remaster" territory as opposed to a full remake. Resuited, but not rebooted. Watch as an HD-ifying line sweeps over the screen to show before and after shots of Citadel Station and its hostile inhabitants. The changes seem fairly light-handed, too.</p>
<p>There's widescreen support, remodelled enemies, "enhanced" reload animations, and "optimized controller support" among other small improvements, we're told. Some similar improvements can already be achieved for free thanks to the game's long-standing mod scene, which lessens the impact of these tweaks a little for anyone who has already done that. The remastering studio were "paying particular attention to the co-op multiplayer" wrote news poster Craig back in 2019, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-knows-who-is-patching-system-shock-2">talking to Nightdive director Stephen Kick</a>. There doesn't appear to be any mention of co-op in the Steam blurb but the studio has previously confirmed it's still intended to appear.</p>
<p>"Multiplayer and co-op is currently in development," said the studio <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1894841847350206848">in a tweet</a> last year. "We will share more info on these and other features as we get closer to launch day."</p>
<p>System Shock 2, while beloved by many, can be quite clunky to play from a modern perspective. It'll be interesting to see whether the changes make one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the best RPGs on PC</a> more approachable. Nightdive have earned a lot of trust with the series - Jeremy expressed much love in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of the System Shock remake</a>, calling it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake." And this upcoming remaster will be free to anyone who pre-ordered that first remake, say Nightdive. So that's nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Four strategy games from Koei all arrive for Switch Online next Friday, 28th March, including two Nobunaga's Ambition titles. 
</p>
<p>
Nobunaga's Ambition lets you compete for control of Japan either as the infamous Oda Nobunaga or his rivals as they attempt to unify the country. This is the same conflict that plays out over the course of Ubisoft's new Feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed, in which Oda Nobunaga is also a key figure.
</p>
<p>
Coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition</li>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness</li>
<li>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4: Wall of Fire </li>
<li>Uncharted Water: New Horizons</li>
</ul>
<p>
And you can watch footage of all four games in the video below:
</p>
<p>
28th March is also when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-game-from-switch-online-catalogue-in-japan">SNES game Super Soccer will be delisted from Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue</a>, at least in Japan - the first game to disappear from the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for more information on why the game will be removed, and whether this removal will also take place elsewhere in the world. We're yet to receive any more information there.

		<p>Still riding the highs of the success of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team has released a new dev diary to reveal more about their upcoming original horror game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Co-directors Jacek Zieba and Wojciech Piejko gave us a tour of this setting. Amongst the inspirations are games like Dead Space and the challenge of Dark Souls, while movies such as Twelve Monkeys also provide some similar tones. The unusual looking suit for the Traveller is intended to look a bit like a deep sea diver, the heavy plates and the large dome-like helmet in particular. You’ll need that armour to survive encounters with the Orphans, the twisted human forms of what is left of humanity from this time, delving into a bit of body horror.</p>
<p>There’s some small snippets of gameplay within the dev diary, but Bloober say that a broader gameplay reveal will likely be coming soon.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this year.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced its first sales milestone for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which launched yesterday and had notched up more than a million players by the afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
It's our first indication of how well the game is performing, as a pivotal title not just for the Assassin's Creed series, but Ubisoft in general - though it is still very early.
</p>
<p>
"It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players," stated a message posted to the official <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067">Assassin's Creed social media account</a>. "Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!"

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows faces some tough comparisons - the series' last large launch Valhalla arrived in late 2020, when many of us were at home - and arrives at a time when Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was also repeatedly delayed for further polish, following last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - another key title for Ubisoft, but one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">which significantly underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
How well does Assassin's Creed Shadows have to do for Ubisoft to consider it a success? The publisher has not said. But it's worth considering the scope and scale of the game, the number of Ubisoft studios working on it, and the impact of those delays. 
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction notched up 1m sales in just 48 hours last week</a>, but will have cost far less to make and market.
</p>
<p>
An early look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/#1w">Steam figures</a> - as the only major platform to share player numbers publicly - shows a peak of 41,412 players overnight. But again, comparisons are difficult - the game is also available on PC via Ubisoft Connect, so this does not paint a full picture. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's likely we'll have to wait until after the game's first weekend - and likely more word from Ubisoft itself - before Shadows' early fortunes become clear.
</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/fbc-firebreak-gameplay-reveals-a-new-supernatural-threat-sticky-notes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> will launch this summer for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, shared a healthy dose of gameplay and revealed one of the big supernatural dangers you’ll face in the game: Sticky Notes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jobs and Gameplay – FBC: Firebreak (Community First Look)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Oh sure, yellow sticky notes seem innocuous enough to you and me, their small size (often cut into cute shapes these days) and weak glue making them mildly useful, but in The Oldest House and with the Hiss still running rampant? Well, haunted sticky notes are a real problem. The gameplay reveal for FBC: Firebreak focuses on this Job, a crisis-filled mission that will take you to the Executive Sector of the Federal Bureau of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. This mission, titled Paper Chase, is just one of many to take on in the game, with the sole objective to destroy as many sticky notes as possible. Other missions might have you try to find mannequin ski instructors and load them onto a paranatural ski lift…</p>
<p>With three-player PvE co-op at its heart, you’ll have three saved loadouts to choose from, Crisis Kits, which are themed around a particular tool and playstyle. You’ll then pick the Threat Level and Clearance Level of a Job, determining the difficulty of enemies and then the complexity and length of the mission.</p>
<p>The trailer and dev diary both show plenty of what you’ll expect to face. There’s regular Hiss zombie-type enemies, bomb squad Hiss with much heavier armour, and then humanoid forms constructed entirely of sticky notes. There’s even a giant Sandman-like boss to battle. One thing you’ll have to be wary of is getting covered with sticky notes yourself, with allies able to wash you down or showers dotted around the world to do the same – albeit at the cost of slowing you down for a bit from the cold water, unless you fix the heaters for the showers.</p>

<p>In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.&nbsp;There’s plenty of Left 4 Dead vibes to the action here, with safe rooms helping to provide some structure to the levels, and the need to defend from alerted enemies.</p>
<p>Remedy has already confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be available day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, PC Game Pass, PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium. In addition to this, they’ve now confirmed that all playable content will be available to all players for free, meaning any new levels will be playable for all. There’s no word on monetisation outside of that, but Remedy will share those details another time.</p>

			<p>Bloober Team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired</a> the first episode of the Cronos: The New Dawn developer diary series during the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025. This episode saw the game's two directors revealing a few details, such as the inspiration, which came from Carpenter's The Thing but also Netflix's TV series Dark, as well as Dead Space, movies like 12 Monkeys, and surprisingly even the Dark Souls series of games was cited as Bloober reportedly seeks to push this game into a slightly more challenging direction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, you play as one of the Travelers. They are being sent to the ruins of human civilization to search for the time rifts and jump back in time to extract people who didn't survive the apocalypse. Travelers are the only ones who can travel to the past and survive the inevitable encounters with monsters. The suit's design looks like a diver because Travelers are not typical soldiers, but more like divers in time.</p>
<p>The setting is an alternative history when the world ends in the 1980s with an apocalyptic event that the team called The Change. Interestingly, the monsters are called the Orphans because they are what was left by humanity. They can take different forms, so players will face different enemies with different abilities. The important ingredient, Bloober Team said, is body horror, perhaps a little bit as an homage to The Thing. So, they are only created from human flesh.</p>
<p>At the end of the deep dive, the directors also replied to a few rapid-fire community questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be ladders</li>
<li>There will be locations with huge walls of flash</li>
<li>There may be aliens</li>
<li>Yes, you can punch monsters in the face (if they have a face)</li>
<li>Fire is important in the game</li>
<li>Dismemberment is featured in Cronos: The New Dawn, but it doesn't work like in Dead Space, as the team implemented their own take on combat</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the highly acclaimed launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team's next project is undoubtedly much anticipated among horror fans. The game is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> may have only been released a couple of weeks ago, but there is already a bidding war for the rights to a reported film adaptation.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">Variety</a>, which revealed a film adaptation of Hazelight's latest co-op caper is now in the pipeline. Sources told the publication that media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - is in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Variety stated offers for rights to the Split Fiction film are "coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios", although no names were mentioned in today's report.</p>

<p>This is not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>It was later suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was attached to the film project</a>, while Pat Casey and Josh Miller - the writing duo behind dj2's live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movies - were working on the big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Little has been heard of the project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

<p>As for Split Fiction, well, it has certainly done well for itself. Along with glowing reviews across the board, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">the game sold 2m copies in the first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Split Fiction news, earlier this week two players were invited to Sweden to see Hazelight's next game after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">they completed a secret level so challenging that "barely" any members of the studio's own team have managed to complete it</a>. "This is a crazy, crazy achievement," Fares told the skilled duo via a pre-recorded message found at the end of the level.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft seemingly has an update in mind for the Xbox App which will show every game users have installed on their PC. That includes titles on both Steam and Epic Games.</p>
<p>Microsoft inadvertently included a mockup of this  user interface as part of an official blog post titled <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox</a>. It subsequently removed the image after enquiries were made, but not before eagle-eyed viewers took a copy.</p>
<p>The image itself, which you can see in the header above, showed an Xbox UI displayed on a TV screen, which at cursory glance may seem unextraordinary, however on closer inspection you can see the UI has a clear Steam tab listed along with the likes of Game Pass, Recently Added and Owned. Elsewhere in the image, the same UI with that telling Steam tab label is displayed on tablets and handheld devices.</p>

<p>While only a Steam label is visible on Xbox's mockup, sources tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">The Verge</a> Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show <em>every</em> game users have installed on their PCs, so that includes the Epic Games Store even though it is missing from the image.</p>
<p>"I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly," The Verge's Tom Warren writes, adding this update is still "in the early stages" of development. It may not even ship at all, Warren suggests.</p>

			<p>During the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025, TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that a new nautical expansion will launch this June for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927200/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord__War_Sails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Sails</a>, it will introduce naval warfare for the first time, as well as a Viking-inspired faction and new explorable coastal regions. Players will be able to command fleets, engage in naval battles, board enemy ships, and enforce blockades, reshaping warfare on land and sea. According to TaleWorlds, the ability to explore by sea, conduct naval blockades, and engage in ship-based combat will influence battle strategies throughout Calradia, not just in the new territories. Beware, though: storms and attrition can undo even the best-laid plans.</p>
<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord Players will have to master wind and water physics, board or ram ships, and cripple enemies by smashing oars, sinking hulls, or tearing sails. There are 18 ships available, each with unique handling characteristics shaped by wind and waves. They can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. Throughout the gameplay, players will get to acquire new ships, upgrade ports or win ships and figureheads.</p>
<p>The Nords call the new Northern Kingdom home. In true Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord style, players will be able to trade, recruit, or fight in this land of craggy peaks and icy fjords. The War Sails expansion also adds a northern sea, islands, rivers and open waters. Of course, players will also find new companions, Norse banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armor, unique weapons, new spears, swords, and axes.</p>

<p>The release of the War Sails expansion, scheduled for June 17, will also be accompanied by the release of the free patch v1.3. The developers are also planning further updates to introduce new gameplay mechanics, including stealth and disguise systems for dungeons and hideouts, random events that will tie into the character trait system, a Parley feature, numerous combat improvements, new weapon types, and additional exciting improvements for players and modders alike.</p>
<p>In closing, TaleWorlds announced that Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord has sold over five million units across all platforms since<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-confirmed-to-launch-on-october-25th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its launch</a> a few years back.</p>

Following a band of lone-wolf vampire hunters who unite to fight for the fate of their world, this marks the second console game from the company. This title will be the first released under new brand AmuLit, formed in September 2024, and has already attracted tons of attention from fans around the world.</p><p>More than just another love story—something Voltage Inc. is renowned for—this title offers a dramatic, thought-provoking narrative, breathtaking visuals, and compelling performances, all brought to you by the talented writers, artists, and cast.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Redbell Tree scrapes the sky, standing proudly in the heart of Hemeria, a land of sunlight. In a land ruled by a monarchy for generations, humans lived in peace and tranquility. That is, until the dawn of the day the world was dyed red.</p><p>On that day, vampires laid waste to Hemeria. They preyed on, devoured, and devastated its inhabitants. A great many people would go on to mourn their loved ones, their families and friends, for the rest of their lives. One particular town of Hemeria bore such a tragedy. A single girl was left alone in despair and disgrace. She vowed revenge, and grew into one of Hemeria’s finest vampire hunters.</p><p>And one day, she became a member of the Elpis 7; those who inspired a light of hope in its people.</p><p>One day, she receives a letter from an unknown sender. Upon her arrival to the mansion indicated inside, she finds vampire hunters and a royal knight awaiting her. The hunters assembled receive an order from the monarch.</p><p>They are to form a squad and invade Nyx, the world of vampires. A shiver of anticipation crackles through her at the opportunity she’s been waiting for her whole life. However, this is but the beginning of a game wherein the fate of her world is at stake. Pawns are sent forth, discarded, hidden out of sight…</p><p>And just how many will remain when this all comes to an end?</p><p><strong>■ Main Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Juliet Rose</strong> (name customizable)</p><p>She who hunts for Revenge.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_001.png"></a></figure><p>An elite vampire hunter and member of the Elpis 7. After her brother, her only living relative, was killed by a vampire, she swore revenge and devoted her life to that of a vampire hunter. Rather than let her hatred consume her, she fights with beauty and strength, which has led to her popularity as a savior of the people.</p><p>She is just as formidable off of the battlefield, and when challenged to games by the residents of Hemeria, she isn’t above cheating to get her way.</p><p>The news of the discovery of an entrance to Nyx, the world of the vampires, stokes a flame within her, and she dives head first into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seek revenge.</p><p><strong>Ciaran Lowell</strong> (voiced by Takuya Eguchi)</p><p>He who hunts for Power.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_002.png"></a></figure><p>Even among the elite vampire hunters that make up the Elpis 7, he is lauded as the strongest. There are whispers that he defeated an aristos vampire at the age of ten.</p><p>Preferring solitude and isolation, he rarely mixes with others. However, he thinks favorably of those in pursuit of strength, and will at times cooperate with the heroine. He takes pride in his own strength, honed by his daily training, but he is pragmatic and will not engage in reckless battle.</p><p>When summoned by the kingdom to join the invasion of Nyx, he is the one whose intentions most closely mirror the heroine’s. He is their trump card.</p><p><strong>Garrett Welkin</strong> (voiced by Daisuke Namikaa)</p><p>He who hunts under Order.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_003.png"></a></figure><p>The hero of Hemeria, promoted to Commander of the Royal Order at a young age.</p><p>The reason behind his ascension to Commander at such a young age is due to the large scale vampire assault he faced in his youth. Many of his fellow trainees lost their lives, but he was the sole survivor, saving the lives of many citizens, and hailed as a hero.</p><p>He is the public’s brightest hope against their fear of vampires.</p><p>Although he has a serious and stubborn side, and claims to hate vampire hunters, he appears before the heroine as the commander of the hunt party.</p><p><strong>Asher Thompson</strong> (voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto)</p><p>He who hunts to Live.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_004.png"></a></figure><p>A childhood friend of the heroine, with a bright and gentle personality. After an abrupt disappearance he eventually returns, having made a name for himself as one of the Elpis 7.</p><p>Both of his parents, the Thompsons, serve as both vampire hunters and mentors towards the heroine.</p><p>He’s a ray of sunshine amongst the otherwise dour members of the squad, but unlike the Asher the heroine knew in her youth, there’s an air of mystery about him.</p><p>His sunny disposition is the foundation of the trust between the hunters, with the hope his light will cut through the darkness of Nyx.</p><p><strong>Rhodes Heartfield</strong> (voiced by Kengo Kawanishi)</p><p>He who raids for Pride.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_005.png"></a></figure><p>An elegant and beautiful aristos vampire. An immortal being with a preference for human blood and manipulator of magic.</p><p>Cloaked in the fragrance of flowers, he seduces his victims with his soft smile and sweet words. He conceals his true identity from the heroine, sneaking into the crevices of her heart to compel her to do his bidding.</p><p>Does he wish to prey on humans, or does he despise them? His true intentions are unknown.</p></div><p>Watch the opening movie below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Another week is upon us - and that means more Epic Games Store freebies, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution-2">Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> currently available for nowt. But things are a little bit different this time around; starting today, Epic is introducing weekly free games to its mobile store - available worldwide on Android devices and on iOS in the EU.
</p>
<p>
As usual, Epic's latest free games are available for seven days - starting today, 20th March, and running through to next Thursday, 27th March. During that time, you can grab the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PC)</li>
<li>Super Meat Boy Forever (iOS/Android)</li>
<li>Eastern Exorcist (iOS/Android)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a decent line-up then, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/jurassic-world-evolution-2">starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> - Frontier Developments' dinosaur-themed park management sequel, in which players attempt to create a thriving dino attraction that, all being well, won't attempt to eat the guests.
</p>
<p>
As for this week's mobile offerings, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a> is a good 'un, taking the twitchy platforming of developer Team Meat's 2010 classic and turning it into an endless runner. "Super Meat Boy Forever does more with two buttons than most do with 14", we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-forever-does-more-with-two-buttons-than-most-do-with-14">wrote back in 2017</a>. And finally, there's Eastern Exorcist - a side-scrolling action RPG set in a fantasy world of spirits and monsters. Epic notes this one's only available in certain regions, but doesn't say which.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what's coming next, you might have to wait a bit. Epic's breaking from tradition this week, and hasn't revealed what'll be replacing its current bunch of free games. Instead, its next two PC freebies are simply listed as "mystery game" over on its store. 
</p>
<p>
Epic, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">launched its mobile store last August</a>, following ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations requiring major companies such as Apple to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on their devices. Not long after, Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-bringing-free-games-to-its-mobile-store-in-a-bid-to-entice-new-users">confirmed its free weekly games programme would be coming to mobile</a>, and here we are now.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didnt-know-i-wanted</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didn%E2%80%99t-know-i-wanted.1140876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-is-the-control-multiplayer-fps-i-didnt-know-i-wanted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Control was IGN’s Game of the Year in 2019 – and I was one of the many editors that voted for it – but even I was skeptical when Remedy, a studio known for telling great single-player stories in third-person games, announced it was doing a Control multiplayer game. That project turned out to be FBC: Firebreak, a three-player PvE first-person multiplayer shooter set six years after the events of Control. And in the hands-off demo I saw, it very quickly became clear that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. Firebreak is refreshingly original in an oversaturated space, delightfully weird amidst a sea of same-y military and/or sci-fi online shooters, and perhaps best of all, it doesn’t require a massive commitment like so many of its contemporaries. As game director Mike Kayatta put it, "We're not about daily check-ins. We're not interested in monthly grinds. We don't want to give anybody a second job." Say it again, Mike, for the people in the back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op FPS with, if what Remedy is promising comes to pass, no nonsense. You can play for 20 minutes or a few hours if you want to, with Perk unlocks and new combinations amongst characters keeping things fresh for repeat runs. But what the heck are you doing here, back in The Oldest House, with a bevy of bizarre weaponry in your hands? Essentially, you are volunteer first responders in The Oldest House when things go seriously sideways. Your characters are secretaries, rangers, and other “normal” occupations who heed the call of service. The Federal Bureau of Control wouldn’t say you’re expendable, but…you’re expendable. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you log in to play, you choose a Job (aka a mission) and a Crisis Kit (essentially, your loadout) before setting the Threat Level (difficulty) and Clearance Level, which determines how many zones you'll be playing through in a run. The zones are separated by containment doors, which will take you to the next stage of the Job. And the Job I saw is called Paper Chase, and it’s set in a fairly mundane office section of the FBC building. The Hiss are spreading, and it’s up to you and your two teammates to work together to beat them back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, you can get the hell out of there as soon as you can if you like, but if you want to get your hands on currencies that let you upgrade and buy new gear, you have to escape safely with them. And the longer you spend exploring for currency, the harder it is to make it back to HQ in one piece. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of gear, that’s where FBC: Firebreak starts to set itself apart from other multiplayer shooters. Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel, like the hand-cranked snowball-launching gun that can put out fires (or your friends who are on fire) and soak the sticky-note monster (uh, more on him in a bit). Or the cobbled-together zapper that, when fitted with the right nozzle, can rain down lightning storms on a room full of bad guys. Or the large wrench that, when a squeaky piggy bank toy is attached, causes a swirl of coins to pelt your opponents. Don’t worry, though; there are still staples like a machinegun and shotgun – the latter of which is the go-to for after you’ve either soaked or zapped one of the sticky-note monsters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Many of the guns are charmingly unusual, and most have a homebrew feel.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh yes, about them: the entire point of this particular Job is to eliminate all of the sticky notes before they overrun the entire brutalist building. Note the number of sticky notes left to destroy in the upper left corner. It will actually go way up as the mission progresses because, by the end of it, you face off against…a gigantic sticky-note monster. Think Sandman from the end of Spider-Man 3, but made out of sticky Post-It notes instead of sand.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just about weird weapons. There are also fun in-universe gameplay mechanics, too, like the office supply shelf that refills your ammo, the makeshift turret you build after literally dumping it out of a box onto the floor, the stereo speaker that keeps the Hiss at bay, and the rinse station that washes any aggressive sticky notes off of your face. Unlockable Perks also inject more spice and variety into the gameplay. A couple of examples I saw: a Perk where each missed bullet has a chance to return to your clip, and another that lets you extinguish yourself by jumping up and down. Also, if you get two of the same Perk you get a stronger version of it. If you get three, you can share the Perk’s effect with nearby teammates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the way, in case you’re wondering, you don’t have to have three people in order to play. You can play solo or in duos as well. Meanwhile, Remedy is aiming for a lower minimum PC spec than usual, but on the opposite end of the spectrum, FBC will also support DLSS4 with multi-frame generation as well as nVidia Reflex and full ray-tracing. It’ll also be Steam Deck verified, and it’s launching into Xbox and PC Game Pass on day one along with PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium. Finally, there is a post-launch content plan that Remedy isn’t ready to share quite yet, and there will be paid cosmetics, but that’s the extent of the microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fairness, I haven’t actually played FBC: Firebreak yet, so I have to be cautious about my enthusiasm. But so far, it certainly passes the eye test. This is almost certainly not a run-of-the-mill multiplayer shooter, in a very good way. And the fact that it’s a get-in and get-out online game that doesn’t require a massive ongoing time commitment in order to enjoy it is a refreshing throwback to the days when that was the norm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

		<p>Developer Path Games has announced its next game and it is called Dark Mass. Much like its previous game Insomnis, Dark Mass is a first person horror title but it swaps a regular, land based mansion for a manor that is deep underwater in the middle of the sea. How did it get there? Well, that’s one of the mysteries. The announcement trailer gives a sense of what to expect in this unusual deep sea dive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Mass - Announcement Trailer | 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2sv9NAia24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dark Mass puts you in the role of deep sea explorer Alice who, along with her brother Reed, set off to to explore a ship wreck. However, they instead find the out of place manor that still retains much of its identity, despite being on the sea bed. Alice soon becomes trapped within the manor and has to solve its puzzle and avoid the horrors that still inhabit the house, including the monster Silas, who stalks Alice through the manor. Throughout the story, Alice maintains contact with Reed, who is on the boat, through a walkie talkie. Navigating through the manor will be slow at times as Alice’s movement is impacted by the deep sea currents. The story will have multiple choices with these leading to different endings.</p>
<p>A release date for Dark Mass is yet to be confirmed, but it is expected at some point this year.</p>

The trailer and screenshots <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-out-june-26-on-ps5-ps4/">on Sony’s announcement blog post</a> show off some light visual updates, but they look like sharpened versions of things like enemy models — maintaining the feel of a 25-year-old game with a little less blur.

If you’re nostalgic for the old RPG overlay look, though, the visual design appears nearly unchanged. There’s even cross-play support for the game’s notoriously rocky cooperative multiplayer mode.</p><p>According to <a href="https://nightdivestudios.com/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-2/">Nightdive’s website</a> and comments from a moderator in the studio Discord server, the game is supposed to include some of the original’s existing community mods on top of offering broader mod support. The Discord moderator says the remaster will ship with the SS2 Community Patch or SCP, which rebalances some frustrating features, among other patches. (This was <a href="https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=11449.0">discussed by Nightdive</a> back in 2020.) We’ve reached out to Nightdive to confirm the details on what exactly mod support will look like, including how the remastered version might play with the ShockEd fan mission editor. The <em>System Shock 2 </em>community has been essentially remastering the game for decades, but an official version makes those efforts a lot easier to find.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Tonight's Future Games Show obviously wasn't about any one game or studio in particular, but funnily enough, it did open and close with games from (technically) one developer. The show started things off with a look at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3494520/Lost_Rift/">Lost Rift</a>, a supernatural, survival, PvPvE extraction game - that's a lot of things - from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/people-can-fly">People Can Fly</a>. In case you were wondering, this is what became of Project Victoria which was shelved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">only three months ago</a>. Weirdly enough, the show then ended with the series that put PCF on the map: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/painkiller">Painkiller</a>. Or, a remake of it anyway.

When I say that these two announcements were technically from one developer, I mostly do mean it in that PCF made the original gory, hellish first-person shooter, whereas this remake is being made by Anshar Studios, a studio mostly known for assisting other developers - it's helped out on games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, and even People Can Fly's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outriders">Outriders</a>.

The Painkiller remake looks like it'll still have plenty of enemies to mow down in increasingly brutal ways, you'd expect that of a game with a name like that, but there's some key changes here that make it more than just a fresh lick of paint. For one, there'll be four characters to play as, each with their own passive ability, and more notably, co-op will be a bigger component this time around. Makes sense with the different playable characters, though I'm normally hesitant about remakes at the best of times, so I'm curious how that emphasis will go down. There's also tarot cards that grant buffs, currencies to earn, skins to unlock, all stuff that mostly just sounds like padding, truth be told.

Painkiller doesn't have a precise release date just yet, but it's currently slated to come out sometime Fall 2025, and it's already available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Steam</a>. I guess <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> isn't guaranteed to be the biggest medieavally, gothicy boomer shooter this year after all.
