            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/suda51-says-everybody-cares-too-much-about-metacritic/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda, also known by his pseudonym Suda51, is the creator of games such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. He is considered a bit of an icon in the games industry and recently spoke about his opinion of Metacritic and how it is affecting the industry.</p>
<p>Suda51 and Shinji Mikami discussed Metacritic in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. They discussed their experience as video game developers and how Metacritic has affected them. "Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores." It isn't surprising that a developer like Suda51 has this opinion, especially when his games are very good at showcasing his sense of humor and personal touch. Despite receiving mixed reviews, he is well known for creating bizarre games that become cult classics.</p>
<p>Compared to other developers in the games industry, Suda51 clearly creates games for himself and what he likes. Most recently, Lollipop Chainsaw was remastered and re-released across platforms. So far, it has received positive reviews and commentary from the audience. "It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula: if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game. If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic."</p>
<p>In particular, Suda51&nbsp;<span>blames AAA companies, stating that those companies don't want to deal with the prospect of a negative online reception because "everyone cares too much about the numbers." This statement feels especially true, as the&nbsp;Director behind Star Wars Outlaws openly spoke out about his disappointment in the Metacritic score</span>&nbsp;despite it not being an inherently bad score.</p>
<p>He has admitted that he learned the hard way about checking Metacritic scores and said that it made him feel bad when media outlets gave his game studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, a zero.</p>
<p>This sort of criticism isn't surprising, as Suda51 is a fan of parody characters and satire in his games. For example, Damon Riccitello is the main antagonist of Travis Strikes Again and No More Heroes III and is a very obvious parody of John Riccitello. This character was made as a nod to the frustrations felt while developing games such as Shadows of the Damned and the strain the company felt while Riccitello was CEO of Electronic Arts.</p>
<p>Metacritic isn't the be-all and end-all of game reviews. Still, many companies are certainly acting like it is, although they are more likely to get beneficial commentary from those who post reviews on Steam or discussion pages and forums dedicated to the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is a project in which many companies came together to create something special. As we've known for a while, the idea <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-great-circle-idea-for-the-indiana-jones-game-was-first-conceived-by-bethesdas-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> from Bethesda Game Studios and Elder Scrolls/Fallout/Starfield franchise director Todd Howard, who then selected MachineGames to develop the game. Of course, since the franchise belongs to Lucasfilm, they had to be involved, too.</p>
<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/craig-derrick-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on Lucasfilm.com, Lucasfilm Games Executive Producer Craig Derrick praised Howard's concept:</p>
<p><em>For an Indiana Jones adventure to truly shine, it needs a globe-trotting journey with a strong historical element—something grounded in reality yet wrapped in mystique or relevance. With The Great Circle, Todd Howard and the team at MachineGames struck gold by centering the story on a real-world mystery: a number of ancient sites around the world align on a perfect, unbroken circle, yet the reason behind this alignment has eluded people for centuries.</em></p>
<p><em>The more I learned, the more fascinated I became with the idea. We delved into what kind of MacGuffin could be linked to all these sites and how each location could be authentically represented within the context of Indy’s life. This process of exploration and discovery fueled the world-building of the game from the very beginning, ensuring that each aspect of the story was both true to the character and engaging for the player.</em></p>
<p>Later in the interview, Derrick named a specific inspiration for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: 1992's point-and-click adventure title Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p>
<p><em>From uncovering and investigating the central mystery of the story to tackling unique situations along the way and outsmarting traps designed to keep the world’s secrets hidden. We wanted the player’s primary focus to be on using their brains before their brawn, although punching bad guys is also a lot of fun. In many ways, we envisioned this game as a spiritual successor to Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and other classic adventure games. It’s about thinking, discovering, tracking down clues, and sometimes just a bit of luck to get through the various traps, tombs, and threats encountered—all while capturing that over-the-top Saturday matinee feel that defines an Indiana Jones adventure.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launches on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PS5 version has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development for Spring 2025. On PC, the game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-and-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> full-fledged path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5.</p>

<p>Vince Zempella has officially revealed the first details of the next Battlefield game, which will be a new 64-player modern-era shooter.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, Vince Zempella confirmed many details already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by Insider Gaming in February 2024</a>. Four of the main bits of information include;</p>



<ul>
<li>It is a return to the classic Battlefield and “back to basics”</li>



<li>A return to 64 player maps</li>



<li>Going back to the class-based system</li>



<li>Aiming for a 2025 release</li>
</ul>



<p>Insider Gaming also reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield is working on a new free-to-play Battle Royale experience</a>. Currently, the game has two different game modes, including the classic Battle Royale experience and a mode named ‘Gauntlet,’ which will see teams of players compete in objective-based modes with the lowest scoring team being kicked out after each mission.</p>



<p>Ont he return to basics approach, Zempella said, “I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it’s that Battlefield 3… Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we’ll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it’s that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it’s nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday…although I would say 1942 also.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield returning to the modern-day shooter? Let us know in the comments below or in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting-first-concept-art-revealed.982485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ahead of its Investor Day on September 17, EA revealed fresh details on its untitled Battlefield game alongside its first officially concept art, which IGN can exclusively reveal for the first time. IGN can also confirm that Battlefield will be returning to a modern setting after stints in World War I, World War II, and the near future.</p><p>While EA is cagey about specifics when it comes to the concept art, including declining to name of the city where its set (though it looks a lot like Italy, France, or somewhere else in Europe), it does include details that should stand out to longtime fans of the series. Among other things, it appears to suggest that ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires. Its greyish color scheme is evocative of Battlefield 4, which remains one of the most popular games in the series despite being released a decade ago.</p><h2>Battlefield goes back to basics</h2><p>All of it points to a back-to-basics approach for the next Battlefield. Indeed, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella is quick to shout out Battlefield 3 and 4 in the course of sitting down with IGN to talk about these new reveals. On the decision to return to the modern era, Zampella says, "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday...although I would say 1942 also."</p><p>The return to the modern setting represents a course correction for the series after Battlefield 2042, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/once-thought-dead-battlefield-2042-sees-huge-surge-of-players-during-free-weekend">eventually found its footing</a> but was otherwise <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-open-beta-specialists-feedback-ea">widely panned for features like Specialists</a> — characters that made it seem as if Battlefield was trying to be a hero shooter. Its ambitious 128-player maps also proved unpopular with fans who preferred a more focused experience. Battlefield 2042 eventually went back to supporting 64 players per maps, and the next Battlefield plans to stick to that approach.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces. Some of them are really good</p></div><p>"Yeah, the 128 player, did it make it more fun? Like...doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense. We're testing everything around what's the most fun. So like you said, the maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different. It's a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields," Zampella says. "I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces. Some of them are really good. I can't wait for you to see some of them.</p><p>Specialists are also out this time around. "So I wasn't there for 2042. I don't know what the rationale was, but for me, it's like the team tried something new. You have to applaud that effort. Not everybody liked it, but you got to try things. It didn't work. It didn't fit. Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that," Zampella says.</p><p>He's careful to stress that Battlefield 2042 wasn't a "failure of a game" despite not doing as well as hoped. He notes that the development team "really spent a lot of time learning how to adapt it and getting things back." Still, he says, EA doesn't want a repeat of the experience it had with 2042. "We want it to be good out of the gate."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Battlefield Review</h3></div></output><p>It adds up to what one might call classic Battlefield, but bigger — big enough that it merits the efforts of four separate studios in DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion (Ridgeline Games was briefly part of its development before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-shuttering-marcus-lehtos-studio">being shuttered</a> after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-co-creator-and-battlefield-game-director-marcus-lehto-leaves-ea">founder Marcus Lehto's departure</a>). EA CEO Andrew Wilson claims it's one of the "most ambitious projects in [EA's] history."</p><p>Nevertheless, Zampella remains vague on what all of that actually entails. "Yeah, it's definitely betting bigger on Battlefield. It's going in and expanding what Battlefield is. We have to have the core. The core Battlefield players know what they want. They've been with us forever, they've been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it's expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we're expanding the offerings that we're giving."</p><h2>The road ahead for Battlefield</h2><p>In the meantime, Activision Blizzard is planning to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 — Battlefield's traditional competitor</a>. Where Battlefield has stumbled, Call of Duty has largely continued to thrive. It begs the question: will Battlefield ever outsell Call of Duty?</p><p>"If you look at the best Battlefields have outsold some Call of Duties and other way around, back and forth. So I think absolutely it can," Zampella says. [<em>Note: While sales data is incomplete, the publicly available data for even weaker releases like Infinite Warfare has </em><a href="https://www.vg247.com/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-was-the-best-selling-game-of-2016-despite-all-your-protests-but-battlefield-1-was-hot-on-its-heels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>typically favored Call of Duty</em></a>]. "I mean, is that what we're going for? I mean, not directly, but always. We're not looking to take down Call of Duty. We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us. But yeah, it definitely has the possibility."</p><p>On the subject of pushing into the transmedia space, where franchises like The Last of Us and Fallout have thrived (the latter taking home an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/emmy-winners-2024-the-full-list">Emmy Award over the weekend</a>), Zampella demurs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"There are definitely opportunities there. We've had some discussions, but it's not our core business. To me, that stuff, when it works, it's super cool... Like Arcane was f*cking great. But there's other ones that haven't worked as well and I won't name those, but you know what they are," he says. "It's a marketing opportunity of getting your franchise out there, and it's not core to what we're doing right now. So we are game first. That has to work. And if the right opportunity comes, absolutely, we'll look at it. And do we take meetings all the time? Sure. But it's not the core business. So it's that balance. I would love to see it. Right now, we're not looking at anything like that for Battlefield."</p><p>It's unclear when the next Battlefield will release, but there are signs that EA is ramping up for 2025, having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-season-7-motive-connected-battlefield-universe">entered full production earlier this year</a>. According to Zampella, EA is "play testing the game every week" and plans to launch a community program next year, though it's unclear if it's a closed beta or something else.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't</p></div><p>"We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in, because that's kind of the core of what we have to do — get the community back on our side, get that trust back," he says. "So I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't."</p><p>Whenever Battlefield eventually releases, it'll be a big test for the series, which has a lot to prove to fans after close to a decade since its last really successful entry. It'll be entering an unsettled console landscape, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024">Sony announcing the PS5 Pro last week</a>, rumors of a next-gen Xbox, and Nintendo expected to announce the Switch 2 soon. Zampella is broadly taking a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vince-zampella-defends-the-ps5-pro-price-battlefield">"we'll see" approach to both the PS5 Pro</a> and the unannounced Switch 2, though he has some kind words for Nintendo in particular.</p><p>"I mean, since [Switch 2] isn't announced and it doesn't exist, I can't really comment on that. But I would say absolutely, Nintendo, along with Microsoft and Sony are great partners for us, are important to us on our business at EA, at Respawn, would love to see it," Zampella says. "We don't have anything to announce, but is there a world? Sure. We love them as partners. They've been great to us. I love the [Switch]."</p><p>One way or another, EA is betting a huge amount of time, money, and manpower on the idea that the multiplayer shooter space is ready for a shakeup. As for whether that bet will pay off, it sounds like we'll know sooner rather than later. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

"The only thing I will say is that we definitely don't want to see anything offensive or inappropriate, so please don't make or install anything like that."</p><p>Mods allow players to create custom content for games, often resulting in incredibly useful gameplay changes such as the ability to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-popular-seamless-co-op-mod-playable-once-more-after-creator-re-writes-it-to-work-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree">play Elden Ring with friends seamlessly</a>, or major additions such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-review-mod">an entire new expansion for Fallout 4</a> or the ability to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-3-mod-lets-you-play-as-fully-customizable-witcher-or-sorceress-with-new-magic-combat-system">play as custom characters in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Main Characters in Final Fantasy 16</h3></div></output><p>Due to the nature of the internet, however, many mods are also, as Yoshida put it, "offensive or inappropriate." While cheating is one thing, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-expresses-concern-over-mods-that-are-offensive-to-public-order-and-morals">fellow publisher Capcom expressed concern</a> in November 2023 that "there are a number of mods that are offensive to public order and morals" which cause damage to the property itself.</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 arrives on PC after lots of back and forth from developer Square Enix. The original reveal trailer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-final-fantasy-16">claimed blatantly the game is "also available on PC,"</a> and while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-demons-souls-ps5-pc-release">Square Enix mysteriously scrapped this claim soon after</a>, its status as a PlayStation 5 exclusive was brought into question again in November 2022 when an advertisement for the PS5's DualSense controller said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-is-according-to-a-playstation-5-ad-exclusive-to-ps5-for-six-months">Final Fantasy 16 would only be a "PS5 exclusive for six months."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-producer-denies-existence-of-pc-version-buy-a-ps5">Yoshida himself then denied a PC version existed at all</a>. "Nobody said a word about a PC version releasing," he said, incorrectly. "Why is it like a PC version is releasing six months later? Don't worry about that, buy a PS5. Sorry, I went overboard. We did our best, so please look forward to it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-is-probably-getting-a-pc-version-but-not-for-a-long-time">Yoshida then admitted in February 2023 it's true that "Final Fantasy 16 is a six-month limited time exclusive on the PS5"</a> but "the PC version will not come out in half a year." This is because the team wouldn't be able to start development until the PS5 version launched in June that year.</p><p>Finally, however, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-pc-port-officially-announced-with-september-release-date-and-a-demo">the role-playing game was announced for PC in August 2024</a>, with the aforementioned September 17 release date. This came after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-final-fantasy-16-and-foamstars-all-failed-to-meet-square-enixs-expectations">Final Fantasy 16 failed to meet the expectations of Square Enix</a> alongside other PlayStation exclusives including Foamstars and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, prompting a shift to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-maker-square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-a-multiplatform-strategy-after-profits-tumble">an aggressive multiplatform strategy going forward</a>.</p><p>Yoshida made clear in August that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-to-double-down-on-xbox-releases-final-fantasy-14-producer-says">Square Enix would be doubling down on Xbox releases</a> following this change in strategy, while Final Fantasy 16 director Hiroshi Takai said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-director-says-future-games-in-the-franchise-will-likely-come-to-pc-day-one">future games in the franchise would likely come to PC on launch</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-review">In our 9/10 review of the PC version</a>, IGN said: "Final Fantasy 16 is certainly a departure from what fans may expect out of a Final Fantasy game, but its excellent story, characters, and world building are right up there with the best the series has to offer."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p dir="ltr">"If we said, 'It'd be great if someone made XYZ,' it might come across as a request, so I'll avoid mentioning any specifics here," Yoshida said. "The only thing I will say is that we definitely don't want to say anything offensive or inappropriate, so please don't make or install anything like that."</p><p dir="ltr">Judging from how there are more than 1,200 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-438559">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> mods on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7remake/mods/?BH=8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, it seems like Yoshida's words may fall on deaf ears. Many of the mods for Final Fantasy 7 Remake--which, like Final Fantasy 16, was once a PlayStation-exclusive--put the game's main cast of characters in new (often revealing) outfits or adjust their body proportions. While there are also plenty of mods that add new weapons, improve the game's visuals, or simply bypass some of the game's grind, the hard truth is that mods that put Tifa, Aerith, or Cloud in a skimpy outfits are in demand.</p><p dir="ltr">History will likely repeat itself with the arrival of Final Fantasy 16 on the platform. Clive and Cid will almost certainly be shirtless (and probably kissing) in a matter of hours after the game's PC release, and Yoshida, despite his best efforts, will have to make peace with that.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 16 launches on PC September 17 via Steam and the Epic Games Store. A base version of the game will be available for $50, with a $70 "Complete Edition" also available that includes the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-16-dlc-echoes-of-the-fallen-releases-today-second-dlc-coming-next-year/1100-6519815/" data-ref-id="1100-6519815">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-the-rising-tide-dlc-releases-in-april/1100-6522093/" data-ref-id="1100-6522093">The Rising Tide</a> DLCs.</p>

                <p>Lego <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> has been in a holding pattern since its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-may-the-4th-brings-star-wars-pass-for-lego-fortnite-and-new-skins-instruments-cars/2900-5337/" data-ref-id="2900-5337">Star Wars-focused Lego Pass</a> concluded in July, but popular mode is expanding in a big way this week with the Lost Isles update, which drops on Tuesday alongside Fortnite patch 31.20. Lost Isles will add a massive new area to your Lego Fortnite world--your island will stay as it is, but you'll be able to travel to another island with five different biomes that are unlike anything from your existing islands, and they're full of new items and weapons for you to discover. We've also got a new Lego Pass, a series of Marvel-oriented Lego kit bundles that include skins, and all players will now be able to build an airship for getting around.</p><p>While Lego Fortnite doesn't have seasons the same that way that battle royale and Festival do, this Lost Isles refresh is on the level of a season launch in terms of how much content it's adding. The world available for all players to explore is doubling in size with the introduction of the Lost Isles area. This new area is separate from your existing map, though. In order to reach it, you'll just need to use a battle bus station. Once you've arrived, you'll have five new environments to check out: the beach, jungle, plains, mountains, and the islands floating in the air above it all.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367724"></a><figcaption>Here's a look at the new Lego Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg"></figure><p>The new Lego Pass features island builds and a new Peely skin. Unlike the previous Lego Pass, which was all about Star Wars, there isn't a collaboration involved with this pass. The Lego Pass has two tracks, a free one and a paid one, which you progress at the same time by completing quests. If you do upgrade to the Premium track for 1400 V-Bucks, you'll get the new Island Adventure Peely immediately. But this pass is pretty short--it ends on October 11.</p><p>If you thought you were going to make it through this announcement without any Marvel stuff, you should have known better. This update is also introducing a trio of new Lego build kits featuring iconic Marvel locations like the Daily Bugle--and they're bundled with Marvel skins. There will be three such sets in the item shop soon: Mary Jane Watson and the Daily Bugle for 2800 V-Bucks; Spider-Man Zero and the Queens apartment block Peter Parker lives in for 2600; and the Weapon X Skin and Weapon X Labs decor items for 2600. Like most bundles that cost V-Bucks, the price will be discounted if you own the skins already--the Daily Bugle will cost only 1300 V-Bucks if you already own Mary Jane, for example.</p><p>Aside from all that, one of the most exciting additions in this update for longtime Fortnite players is the Klombo, a large, four-legged lizard who appeared in battle royale in Chapter 3 Season 1. The Klombo is a friendly fella usually, happy to have players ride on his back or to provide rewards if you fed him berries--but his wrath was legendary if you annoyed him. It's been more than two-and-a-half years since we last saw a Klombo, so this is pretty exciting.</p>

<p>If you've spent any time with retro gaming emulators, you're likely familiar with the joy of browsing through a long list of (legally obtained) ROMs and feeling overwhelmed at a wide range of titles you've never even heard of. Picking randomly through such a game list is like wandering through a foreign country, searching for hidden jewels among all the shovelware in the bewildering and wildly imaginative early video game history.
</p><p><em>UFO 50</em> captures that feeling perfectly, combining the freewheeling inventiveness of old-school game design with modern refinements and more consistent baseline quality bred over the ensuing decades. The result is an extremely playable love letter to the gaming history that will charm even the most jaded retro game fan.</p>
<h2>A loving homage</h2>
<p><em>UFO 50</em> presents itself as a collection of 50 dusty game cartridges made by UFO Soft, a fictional developer that operated from 1982 to 1989. Working through the company's catalog, you'll see evolution in graphics, music, and gameplay design that mirror the ever-changing gaming market of the real-world '80s. You'll also see the same characters, motifs, and credited "developers" appearing over and over again, building a convincing world behind the games themselves.</p>
<p>The individual games in <em>UFO 50</em> definitely wear their influences on their sleeves, with countless, almost overt homages to specific '80s arcade and console games. But there isn't a single title here that I'd consider a simple clone or knock-off of an old gaming concept; each sub-game brings its own twist or novel idea that makes it feel new.</p>

<p><em>Bubble Bobble</em> homage <em>Kick Club</em>, for instance, replaces its inspiration's bubble-blowing dinosaurs with a soccer player that has to constantly chase down his only weapon: a soccer ball. <em>Vainger</em> combines <em>Metroid</em>-style shooting and gated, maze-like exploration with the gravity-flipping of <em>Metal Storm</em>. <em>Magic Garden</em> combines the avoid-your-own-tail gameplay of <em>Snake</em> with items that let you eat up obstacles, <em>Pac-Man</em>-style.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Anyone who remembers playing games in the '80s will instantly clock plenty of other clear references. A small sampling of ones I noticed includes: <em>Bad Dudes</em>, <em>Blaster Master</em>, <em>Gradius</em>, <em>River City Ransom</em>, <em>Shadowgate</em>, <em>Super Dodge Ball</em>, <em>Smash TV</em>, <em>Space Harrier</em>, and <em>Super Sprint</em>. And, just like any list of '80s ROMs, you'll also encounter plenty of grid-based puzzle games and shoot-em-ups, each with their own take on the popular genres.</p>
<p>But other <em>UFO 50</em> offerings are retro-stylized versions of genres and games that didn't really exist in the '80s. If you ever wondered what a caveman-themed tower defense game would look like on the NES, <em>Rock On! Island</em> has the answer. Or if you want to see a positional arena fighter in the style of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> (complete with original characters that sport their own moves and weapons) then <em>Hyper Contender</em> has you covered. Then there's <em>Velgress</em>, which combines the retro run-and-gun platforming of the NES with the roguelike procedural generation of a modern classic like <em>Downwell</em>.</p>
<p>Still, other <em>UFO 50</em> games squeeze completely original concepts (as far as I can tell) into the limited technology of the time period. <em>Lords of Diskonia</em> is a tactical battler that has you flinging units represented by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/521/crokinole">Crokinole</a>-style disks at the other side. <em>Party House</em> asks you to manage a Rolodex of party guests to maximize your money and popularity without attracting unwelcome attention from the cops. <em>Waldorf's Journey</em> involves flinging the titular walrus on lengthy blind jumps while carefully adjusting his landing with hilarious, energy-consuming flaps of his flippers.</p>

<p>The sheer variety of different gameplay ideas on offer here is incredible. There are real-time strategy games and cooperative two-player brawlers. There's a full-fledged golf RPG and also a 2D golf game with pinball-style hazards. There's a <em>Dave the Diver</em>-esque undersea exploration adventure and a couple of Final Fantasy<em>-</em>style RPGs. There's a game that combines <em>Crazy Taxi</em> and the original, overhead <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. There's a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> homage that combines five different genres with five unique, fully realized anthropomorphic human-animal hybrids.</p>

        <p>Redundancies could affect over 40 employees.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
nDreams, the VR-focused developer behind the likes of Far Cry VR and Synapse, has confirmed restructuring and redundancies that could affect up to 17.5 percent of its workforce.
</p>
<p>
The UK studio, which was founded in 2006, currently consists of four teams - nDreams Studio, Orbital, Near Light, and Elevation -  employing around 250 people between them. That means upward of 40 staff could lose their jobs as nDreams' redundancy process proceeds.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-studio-ndreams-confirms-layoffs-could-impact-17-5-percent-of-workforce">provided to Game Developer</a>, nDreams CEO Patrick O'Luanaigh blamed the cuts on a "challenging VR games market" requiring a "renewed strategic focus". O'Luanaigh added that jobs may be cut at all levels, "including senior leadership".

<p>
"We are working tirelessly to support our team with the respect and care they deserve throughout this challenging process," O'Luanaigh wrote, "including all our efforts to comprehensively assist those whose positions may be impacted to move into new roles within nDreams or elsewhere."
</p>
<p>
"Having been fully-focused on VR development since 2013," he continued, "we have inevitably faced many challenges in building a modest independent studio into a world-leading VR game developer... These necessary considerations of losing valued team members are the most difficult yet, but our belief in XR gaming is undimmed."
</p>
<p>
VR games Frenzies and Vendetta Forever, both currently in development at nDreams, are said to be unaffected by the restructuring, with O'Luanaigh insisting the changes will "better serve current and future audiences in creating medium-defining titles for years to come."
</p>
<p>
Today's news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-and-powerwash-simulator-vr-developer-ndreams-acquired">nDreams' $110m USD acquired</a> by Swedish conglomerate Aonic last November, and continues a year which has now seen over 12,500 games industry workers lose their jobs. In February, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">laid off 900 PlayStation employees</a>, while Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">latest Xbox layoffs</a> means over 2,550 workers have lost their jobs at the company in the last year.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-appears-to-be-targeting-40-launch-price/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marathon, Bungie's new project, supposedly targets a $40 launch price. Marathon is an upcoming PvP extraction shooter originally revealed in May 2023. Sources have reportedly spoken to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-marathon-targeting-40-launch-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Post</a> about the upcoming title and that they're considering a $40 launch price for Marathon.</p>
<p>This suggests that Bungie is opting for the game to be a pay-to-play premium model rather than free-to-play with microtransactions, as seen in plenty of current games, including their well-known Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Recently, Bungie and<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/"> Sony</a> have discussed Marathon's pricing strategy and how they will approach it. Conversations and an extended dialogue likely happened once Sony's latest live-service game, Concord, failed to take off and was shut down and refunded just two weeks later.</p>
<p>Since its announcement, Marathon has continued to stir up conversation and controversy, especially under its new director, Joe Ziegler. This is because people feel the game may be veering too close to hero shooters like Valorant and Overwatch. After all, Concord was one of those hero shooters, and it just didn't take off the way Sony expected it to.</p>
<p>According to The Game Post, multiple sources have since confirmed that Marathon is not "hero-focused. " Instead, the heroes in Marathon are classes with their own set of abilities and special abilities, making them all degrees of different from each other. Unlike other hero shooters, the gameplay structure is similar to Escape from Tarkov but with a "Bungie twist." Only two maps are playable, but it's uncertain whether it will get more than just two maps when it eventually releases.</p>
<p>In the past couple of months, Bungie has been conducting playtests with people from the internal teams, streamers, and content creators all participating. So far, the feedback suggests that it is somewhat positive but not worth the $40 price tag. If they continue to go through with it, they may risk facing the same treatment that Concord did.</p>
<p>Although the company is receiving positive feedback during the playtests, it's said that morale within Bungie is continuing to remain low as the developers are growing frustrated with leadership changes at the studio. As a result, concern continues to soar regarding the launch of Marathon. In addition, they are also facing anxiety about Destiny 2's future and how it will<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-celebrates-10-years-of-destiny-shares-codename-frontiers-details/"> shape up with the new expansion model</a>.</p>
<p>The team creating Marathon is riding high, and its success has the potential to be pivotal for Bungie and Destiny. A new trailer for Marathon is said to be in production, which may reveal some new details about the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-pubg-mobile-update-adds-new-maps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PUBG Mobile has revealed two new WOW maps and other content as a part of the Green Game Jam 2024 campaign, Play for Green.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-new-wow-maps-for-pubg-mobile">2 New WOW Maps for PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>The developers of PUBG mobile worked with climatologist Professor Mark Maslin to imagine how the world of this game would appear after 100 years of climate change. This collaboration led to creating two maps, Ruins of Erangel Sandstorm and Exploration, in the World of Wonder mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Through these PUBG Mobile maps, the developers hope to create a visualisation of the future, where climate change impacts the world in devastating ways. The maps feature elements like raging sandstorms, dead trees, sea level rise, and more.</p>



<p>In Ruins of Erangel: Sandstorm, players must race to collect medical supplies across the map. As the sandstorm closes in, the player who survives the longest wins the match. Ruins of Erangel: Exploration, players will be able to participate in a “unique narrative-driven experience” that features a “powerful story about the impact of climate change”.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here are the <a href="https://x.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1835720125594660923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">codes</a> to access the two new PUBG Mobile maps:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ruins of Erangel Sandstorm: 8532400</li>



<li>Ruins of Erangel Exploration: 8532398</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-new-themed-wow-items">New Themed WOW Items</h2>



<p>Some new themed items have also dropped for the World of Wonder mode to keep the conversation about environmental change going. These Play for Green-themed items include two endangered plants, the Giant Baobab Tree and the California Redwood, a new Classic Blue Zone Device Effect (Sandstorm Zone), a new Water Cube Appearance (Lava and Polluted Water), and the Green Game Jam logo.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-mobile-run-for-green-event">PUBG Mobile Run for Green Event</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile also has a Play for Green-themed event for the game’s classic modes. Each player’s sprint distance across any of the game’s classic modes during the event will contribute to server-wide milestones. These milestones will help “aid projects worldwide in protecting vital habitats.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the Run for Green event, players can unlock a new interactive area in PUBG Mobile’s Home mode. The interactive area is a garden that brings attention to “5 endangered tree and plant species in the real world,” including the Giant Baobab Tree, Wollemi pine, Monkey Puzzle Tree, Pitcher Plant, and Corpse Flower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego Fortnite is getting a new expansion this week. Dubbed “The Lost Isles”, this new expansion to the game adds a number of new areas, weapons, creatures, and more.</p>



<p>“Landfall has been made on Lost Isles, a new addition to your world begging to be explored,” the description reads. “Step boldly ashore, face its unknown dangers, and prepare for a LEGO® adventure unlike any before.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Explore Lost Isles in LEGO Fortnite!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UqRxFLOG68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There are five new areas for players to explore, each with their own unique feel: Beach, Plains, Jungle, Mountains, and Floating Islands. </p>



<p>Some regions have friendly characters that just need help (the Plains). Others, however, could have you come up against Storm-Wild Tomatoes.</p>



<p>As part of this new expansion for Lego Fortnite, there will be a new battle pass called the “Tropical Treasures Lego Pass”. The pass will offer players more items and builds to unlock. It will run until October 11.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lego Fortnite’s Lost Isles expansion releases for everyone on September 17. Full details on the update can be found via <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/explore-lost-isles-in-lego-fortnite-v31-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games and Fortnite</a>.</p>

You can’t make this work while offline, and you can’t invite anyone for Remote Play if you’re Invisible either. <strong>Once you’re visible online and running the game, go into the Steam Overlay (shift+tab) and click on the Remote Play Together button.</strong><br></p><p>This will bring up an overlay box where you can send invites, adjust what inputs they have access to, and change what kind of quality the stream prioritizes. <strong>Click on the Invite a Friend button to open your Friends List and choose which of your pals you’d like to go on a cult adventure with.</strong> After they accept, they’ll be able to see and interact with your stream through their Steam Application.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480">18 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting <em>Cult Of The Lamb</em></a></span></p><p>The rest works the same as it does for a typical local co-op session.

It is basically streaming a local co-op game, and Remote Play itself can have kinks and problems. Here are a few tips to make the experience more seamless:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Remote Play only allows for one Keyboard and Mouse input, so the second player must use a controller.</strong> If your friend doesn’t have one, their next best option is to look into a virtual controller setup.</li><li>Although this does avoid some of the issues in traditional online play, stable internet connections are still vital here. Just because everything is running fine on the host’s side, doesn’t mean the invited player is enjoying the same experience. <strong>Ensure everyone has decent enough connections to host and watch a stream.</strong></li><li><strong>Changing the Quality in the Steam Remote Play settings can also help make the experience less of a hassle.</strong> The host can change between Automatic, Balanced, Beautiful, and Fast Quality. Give them all a spin to see what works best for everyone.</li><li>Bouncing off of the above, I recommend the host to become familiar with the Remote Play settings in general. Although only one keyboard and mouse input will be recognized, all players can share the control of it. <strong>The host might need to limit keyboard and mouse access to only themselves if there are some weird input issues happening.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>You should now be better prepared to sway the non-believers in <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> with a friend, no matter if they’re next to you or joining from further away. Just don’t forget that this is a Steam-exclusive feature. You’ll be out of luck if you’re playing on a console or purchased the game through GOG. Adding proper online co-op would be a pretty big undertaking, and isn’t likely to be added in the future, but for now this is a pretty accessible alternative if you and your friends play on Steam together.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the main game, you’d often fly to a few different worlds to finish a large quest. Here, Bethesda is promising that the entire expansion will take place on this one world and will be focused on the power vacuum that exists in House  Va’ruun following a devastating incident involving gravity-defying technology. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944">We’ve said this before</a></span>, but <em>Shattered Space </em>really seems like exactly what <em>Starfield</em> needs. While the main game played fine and looked alright, the worlds you visited were often empty or contained copy-pasted areas to explore over and over. What <em>Starfield</em> needed was some new, fresh, handmade content that feels weird and offers players a totally new experience. And <em>Shattered Space</em> looks to be just that. </p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>launches on September 23 on Xbox Series X/S and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda describes Va’ruun as an “isolated, handcrafted new world in Starfield’s first major story expansion,” and compares it to some of the biggest and best expansions it has released for its The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The “handcrafted” note in particular feels deliberate. Starfield was criticized by some for leaving the handcrafted feel of Bethesda Game Studios’ previous titles behind in favor of a galaxy-spanning adventure filled with over 1,000 planets, most of which were fueled by procedural generation.</p><p>Shattered Space, on the other hand, revolves around a solitary planet, and in the deep dive video Bethesda developers stressed that the entirety of the expansion takes place on it. There is no need to leave it at all.</p><p>“From the minute you arrive on Va’ruun’kai the story never sends you off planet,” Tim Lamb, lead creative producer, said. “You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.</p></div><p>“We wanted to give you the opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of this location and find clues as to who these people really are and what happened to them,” added lead producer Joe Mueller.</p><p>“When we first started thinking about what this experience would be like, we knew we wanted it to feel like a traditional Bethesda Game Studios expansion. Having the planet laid out so intentionally works perfectly with this isolationist society. Everything they’ve done since establishing themselves will be right here on Va’ruun’kai. The whole planet tells the story of these people who have never left their home and want to remain a secret.”</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Shattered Space, players will visit the homeworld of House Va’ruun for the first time. Explore a fully handcrafted new location and unravel the mysteries surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent. House Va’ruun is on the brink of collapse and their people need help finding a path forward. When your sudden presence on their hidden home planet is seen by some as divine intervention, it’s up to you to restore House Va’ruun and decide the fate of this secretive faction.</blockquote><p>Bethesda also talked up Shattered Space’s more chaotic, aggressive, in-your-face combat, in contrast to the distance shooting of the base game. Expect ambushes from odd creatures that pop up through rifts in spacetime. Storywise, you end up caught up in a political feud between the planet’s various pockets of power, and ultimately decide the fate of House Va’ruun.</p><p>Starfield, which enjoyed the biggest launch in Bethesda Game Studios history, is available on PC and Xbox Series X and S. Shattered Space launches on those same platforms on September 30.</p><p>Owners of the Premium or Constellation Editions of Starfield get Shattered Space as part of their original purchase. Owners of the base edition can still purchase the Premium Upgrade for access to Shattered Space plus other digital items including the Digital Art Book, Original Soundtrack, 1,000 Creation Credits, and the Constellation Skin pack.</p><p>Bethesda is of course working on more than Starfield expansions. It’s also got <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> to contend with, alongside updates for MMOs Fallout 76 and The Elder Scrolls Online.
