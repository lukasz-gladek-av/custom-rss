            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Isabela Merced is slated to star in a movie adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega’s </a>House of the Dead franchise.</p>



<p>It seems like video game franchises are being adapted for film and TV at a rapid pace. Not only are video game stalwarts like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog starring in brand-new movies, but more recent video games such as The Last of God and Uncharted are being adapted for TV series.</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Isabela Merced, known for her work in the aforementioned The Last of Us TV series, will be in a leading role in a new film about the House of the Dead. Paul W.S. Anderson will write and direct the project. He previously adapted the Resident Evil franchise for the big screen over 20 years ago.</p>



<p>He also adapted the Monster Hunter series for a 2020 film, but it was not nearly as well-received as the Resident Evil movies.</p>



<p>In 2003 and 2006, two House of the Dead films were released, but they were critically panned.</p>



<h2 id="h-history-of-the-house-of-the-dead">History of the House of the Dead</h2>



<p>How’s the dead began life in 1997. It was originally a light gun arcade game. Games were regularly released up until House of the Dead 4 in 2005. An arcade release in 2018 was titled “Scarlet Dawn.”</p>



<p>There were also spin-offs, such as 1999’s The Typing of the Dead, designed to improve typing; it was later re-released for the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. 1999 also saw the arcade release of Revenge, a beat-’em-up take on the franchise.</p>

<h2>Bad news for Valve in particular?</h2>
<p>On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption.</p>
<p>Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases.</p>
<p>F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.”</p>

<p>The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said.</p>
<p>That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added.</p>
<p>“I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.”</p>

              <p><span>The Analogue 3D, a premium gaming console that’s fully compatible with Nintendo 64 games, just got</span> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-prototype"><span>a new line</span></a><span> of translucent colorways replicating five colors that were prototyped for the N64 but never released. The new Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions follow the limited release of Analogue’s Funtastic line, which replicated the N64’s Funtastic colorful translucent shells last December and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1pj8cgh/analogue_3d_limited_editions_what_sold_out_first/"><span>sold out</span></a><span> in less than two hours.</span></p> <p><span>The new limited edition line comes in five colors: Ghost, in sea glass (and the star of the show, in my opinion); Glacier, in milky white; Atomic Purple, in deep plum; Extreme Green, in, you guessed it, neon green; and Ocean, in cobalt.</span></p>   <p><span>“Five colors were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64,” the company writes. “Unreleased. Until now. They were real. They were manufactured. They were never released.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The company continues, “Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions finally release these lost colors as limited editions. History, finished. Decades later.”</span></p> <p><span>The unreleased N64 colors were </span><a href="https://consolevariations.com/blog/5-rumored-n64-prototypes-finally-discovered"><span>discovered</span></a><span> in 2019 by Console Variations, after a former Nintendo of Europe employee contacted the site. This little piece of lost video game history will be restored for the lucky customers who manage to get their hands on the new line before it sells out.</span></p> <p><span>The “highly limited” Analogue 3D: Prototype Edition consoles will be available for purchase on Monday, February 9 at 8 a.m. PST, and will ship within 48 hours. They will retail at $299.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In partnership with Analogue, 8BitDo is releasing a series of matching controllers for the new Prototype console line. The controllers will also be available for preorder on February 9 at 8am PST, though they won’t ship out until April. The controllers will be sold (separately) for $44.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition to the Analogue 3D, the console maker also sells the Analogue Pocket, a handheld compatible with games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (though it’s currently out of stock).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Analogue 3D is available in standard Black and White for $269.99, with matching 8BitDo controllers sold separately for $39.99.</span></p>

<p>Another short trailer for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/" id="3170">Super Mario Galaxy movie</a> just dropped, and Yoshi again takes center stage, taking out one of Bowser’s most well-known minions in the most Yoshi way possible.</p>



<p>The new trailer, with the tagline “Level Up,” features previously seen clips of Bowser Jr., Mario, and Luigi. However, there are also new images of Princess Peach with Toad in a cyberpunk-looking environment, and at one point, they appear to enter a bar, with several low-level enemies from Mario video games giving them a dirty look.</p>



<p>Yoshi is also shown riding a motorcycle, similar to what Mario and Luigi did in a previous trailer. He also confronts Kamek, swallows him whole, lays an egg with Kamek’s glasses on it, and then pilots the vehicle Kamek had been piloting. Princess Rosalina is also seen in a brief action shot towards the end.</p>

<h2 id="h-this-movie-takes-inspiration-from-several-generations-of-super-mario-video-games">This Movie Takes Inspiration From Several Generations of Super Mario Video Games</h2>



<p>This movie is named after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy/" id="2961">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game, which was released on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-wii/" id="1031">Nintendo Wii</a>. but takes inspiration from many Mario games that came before and after the classic game from 2007.</p>



<p>A previous trailer showcased Birdo and Mouser from Super Mario Bros. 2. Baby Mario and Baby Luigi were also on display, being carried by Yoshi as they ran away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>There has been no sign yet of Donkey Kong or any of the Kongs that were featured in the first Super Mario movie.</p>







<p>The movie is slated for release on April 1. It was previously noted that the movie was in post-production after animation was completed.</p>

            <guid>1428622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the brainchild of Loric Games, a group of former Mythic Entertainment employees with a smattering of Bethesda developers mixed in. Having worked on titles such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/endurance-star-wars-old-republic" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b37f30ad-c8cb-4f8d-a44b-58b67d95bb81" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em></a> and <em>Dark Age of Camelot</em>, the studio has taken their extensive experience to head into uncharted territory with their debut title. Learn how Loric Games is approaching Early Access, and whether the sandbox survival airship RPG is for you with our <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> preview.</p><h2>Colorful, Carefree, and Calming</h2><p>Set as a sandbox RPG with survival elements thrown in, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> takes a different path than other games in the survival genre. You’ll find a bright blue sky, fluffy clouds, bright rooftops, and vivid flowers throughout the world’s floating islands. For the land of the dead, it is quite cheerful. Combined with the atmospheric music, the title can even be labeled calming.</p><p>The art is the main reason I became interested in the game. Survival games typically evoke an apocalyptic style with darker colors, dreariness, and an overbearing sense of despair. With a color scheme that deviates from the norm, it's easy for <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> to stand out in the crowded survival genre.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/using-a-harpoon-echoes-of-elysium.jpg?itok=J0UTlEBf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><p>While there are some survival aspects to the game, the title absolutely feels like a sandbox airship builder. You need to harvest rocks, trees, plant fiber, and fuel. You build your airship, which acts as a flying base. There’s food to forage and inventory to manage, but items don't spoil, and basic resources are easy to gather.</p><p>You don’t have any thirst or hunger, and your stamina mainly comes into play when gliding across the open expanse or fighting. Instead of having to track down your items, which you still have to do if you were away from your ship when you perished, you’ll be cursed with a debuff. When you die and respawn, you’ll need to find food that cures your new status or wait until the buff wears off.</p><p>I enjoyed gliding through the air, seeing the different islands, and finding new items to harvest. However, there’s not much else to do aside from that. The narrative, which is an element the team is still working on, is barely there, at best.</p><p>You get a story in the opening cutscene, are introduced to an NPC that aids you, and receive a quick tutorial. Once you capture your first Dry Dock, however, you can spend hours wandering the vast expanse without discovering another snippet of story. It’s even possible to skip part of the story if you find the boss’s den by accident.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/npc-lethe-narrative-echoes-of-elysium.jpg?itok=71ehVh16 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><p>During a preview presentation with Loric Games, it was admitted that the narrative doesn’t rank as high on the list of important items. Making airships into flying bases and nailing the associated mechanics are the focuses and stars of the game. The story will be coming, but it may not be as extensive or featured as prominently as some survival or RPG players will want.&nbsp;</p><p>As a survival title, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> misses the mark. There’s no pressure to actually survive. If you don’t die, you never need to eat or drink. There are no elements affecting your mood. Aside from falling out of the air and the scattering of enemies you can encounter, death is far from a concern.</p><p>As a sandbox builder, the title hits the main points, making it far more successful in that regard. You can build beautiful airships without having to worry about your skill as a builder, thanks to the rounded walls. Weight isn’t even an issue as long as you have enough propellers, allowing you to truly get creative with your build.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enemy-airship-echoes-of-alysium.jpg?itok=Sk5fhY0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enemy-airship-echoes-of-alysium.jpg?itok=ILm6cHwI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture></p><p>The biggest downfall of <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> is the somewhat grindy nature of the game when it comes to advanced resources, especially fuel, and the time it takes to travel from one island cluster to another. I often abandoned my airship to traverse with my glider. Even over large expanses, it was my preferred method of travel. While airships aren’t as slow as the ships in Skull &amp; Bones, it’s still a time investment to make your way around the map looking for resources.</p><p>On top of that, the game crashes, there can be glitches causing enemies to become invincible, and items can fall out of the sky, making them inaccessible. At first, I experienced quite a bit of lag that made playing almost impossible. That has vastly improved, but people with older machines may experience what feels like never ending lag.</p><p><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> has great bones and some great potential, it just needed more time in the oven. More narrative would add some structure to the experience. Additional resources, more concrete ways to find said resources, and more mechanics to craft items easily would ensure everyone who plays the title understands how to advance.<picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echoes-of-elysium-gliding_0.jpg?itok=8NSx7aLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture></p><h2><em>Echoes of Elysium</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Even though there are issues, Loric Games’ outlook on Early Access assures fans they will continue working on the title. Taking a stance, a few years old, the studio will be listening to player feedback and furthering development through the EA phase, with the player base in mind. While this was how EA originally started for many games in the past, this hasn’t been the modus operandi for the majority of current EA releases. If you’re interested in the growth of the game and impacting how the world evolves, <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> will be a great fit for you. If you’d rather have an almost completed title that’s pretty polished with lots of content for you to play through, you may want to wait until <em>Echoes of Elysium</em> fully launches.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Echoes of Elysium</strong> was previewed on PC with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 11 hours.

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Time To Start Building Your 4K Movie Collection]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-to-why-build-4k-uhd-blu-ray-physical-movie-collection-ps5-help-2000666185</link>
            <guid>1428619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In theory, movies are more accessible than ever before. You are literally reading this on a device that likely has access to a dozen or more streaming video apps and stores, like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Tubi, and Hulu. And yet, in reality, things are dire.<a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/disney-original-movies-series-content-removal-emea-1235813461/"> Movies can be pulled instantly from a service</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617">bad versions can be uploaded</a> and replace what existed before, and trying to manage multiple apps is expensive and annoying. It all sucks so much.</p> <p>So, I suggest that if you care about movies and want to avoid all of that nonsense and take back control of your media, you <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">cancel some services</a> and start investing in a physical movie collection. More specifically, I suggest you start building out a 4K UHD library of movies.</p>

 <h2>Why 4K UHD?</h2> <p>There are a few reasons why I think it’s a smart move to start investing in a 4K UHD collection of your favorite films. The biggest being that, at this point, it seems very unlikely that 4K UHD Blu-ray discs will ever be topped. That’s not to say 8K resolution TVs or content aren’t a thing. They are. But the reality is that physical media is no longer king.</p> <p>Digital streaming, even with its flaws, is the popular option. I can’t imagine any of the companies that would need to be invested in such a project actually working to create, promote, distribute, and support a new disc format for movies in the future. I don’t think we’ll get a widely sold, mass-produced, and studio-supported 8K disc or better.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/sorry-8k-tvs-have-flopped-2000716663">Another wrinkle is that in 2026, only Samsung is even making and selling consumer 8K TVs</a>. And many stores aren’t even selling physical movies anyway. Why would any company invest in a new superior physical format? No. 4K UHD is almost certainly the <a href="https://obsoletesony.substack.com/p/the-last-disc">last and best quality physical format</a> we’ll ever see. A bit depressing, but it does mean that you can invest in a big 4K UHD collection, safe in the knowledge that 10 years from now, 8K discs won’t pop up. Plus, 4k UHD is so damn good already that I’m not even convinced 8K movies are worth it.</p>

 <h2>What do I need to watch 4K movies?</h2> <p>If you own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X with a disc drive, you already own a damn fine 4K UHD player. And better yet, the cable that was included with your console, assuming you still have it, is going to be perfect. If you own an Xbox One S, that’ll work, too. And if you really want to, you can buy a 4K UHD player, but just know they get pricey fast. On the other hand, they mostly support Dolby Vision/HDR10+, which, for some reason, none of those consoles do when using physical media. Whatever you settle on, plug it into your 4K TV.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000009435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000009435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000009435">©Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>And yeah, you’ll need a 4K TV.&nbsp;If you don’t already own a 4K TV, it’s time to buy one. I mean, if you plan on collecting 4K UHD movies, you should invest in a nice TV to watch them on. Now, you can go wild and buy some incredibly big and expensive set, but there are also plenty of solid, cheaper 4K sets available on the market these days. I’d avoid going below $300 and would also stay away from TCL sets, as I’ve had nothing but trouble with them in the past, as have others. Still, even a cheapo 4K TV can provide a big improvement over an old 1080p set.</p>

 <p>Now, plug your player or console into your 4KTV with a good-quality HDMI cable and take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! Welcome to the future. Or well, 2015. Anyway, with that all out of the way, it is time for the fun part: Actually buying and watching movies!</p> <h2>What movies to buy first and where?</h2> <p>I always recommend that you buy some of your favorite movies, assuming they’ve made the leap to 4K UHD. (More on that later.) This is going to jumpstart your collection with stuff you like, and assuming you’ve watched your favorite films a few times, seeing them in 4K should provide a nice example of the leap in quality over streaming and 1080p Blu-Rays or even lower-quality DVDs.</p> <p>I’d also advise building a list of movies you want to buy and which ones you have bought. This will help a lot when you’re out and about and not near your collection, but spot a good deal on a movie. Check the list to see if you own it, and if not, buy it! It’ll also help you figure out which of your targets have made the leap to 4K UHD. Not every movie has, and while most of the bigger hits and cult classics have been brought over to the 4K format, there are still some odd exceptions and plenty of smaller films left out.</p>

 <p>As to where to buy your 4K UHDs, there are a few different options. Personally, my favorite place to get 4K movies is at a few of my local used game and movie stores. They tend to have good deals, and stumbling through a random assortment of movies not fed to you via an algorithm means you might discover some hidden gem you forgot about. eBay and Mercari are also good options, but just be careful, as always, when using these sites. And be prepared for some problems.</p> <p>Your big box stores, like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, might not be very useful in your hunt for new 4K UHD flicks. Not all of them have ditched physical movies and games, but some have, and plenty of others are drastically cutting down on how much they keep in stock at their brick-and-mortar stores. A smarter use of your time is to keep an eye out for deals on Amazon and follow Wario64 to find sales on 4K movies on sites like Gruv.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666518">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What about Blu-ray and DVD?</h2> <p>As I mentioned already, standard Blu-rays and DVDs don’t offer the same high resolution as 4K UHD. But, sadly, a lot of movies haven’t been converted to 4K UHD and some you may hope to acquire likely haven’t even received Blu-ray releases. In cases like that, you’re going to have to buy non-4K discs to enjoy those hard-to-find films. The good news is that even DVDs still look pretty good thanks to devices like the PS5, which upscale them slightly in a way that looks sharp but not artificial. So don’t feel weird buying a DVD. You’ll still get a nice picture out of it, assuming it was transferred well.</p> <p>And that’s it. I really do think more people should start building up physical movie collections, not just because it lets you take control of your media, but because scrolling through an app or a media server isn’t nearly as fun as flipping through a collection of physical boxes that contain movies. Grabbing one, loading it in, popping the case down, and watching something becomes a production, but in a good way. I find it helps me focus on the film and the act of watching it. I’m no longer passively hitting buttons to watch some random Netflix slop. I’m actively loading up a machine with a movie to enjoy. And I didn’t realize how much I missed that feeling.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has dropped a new trailer for <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7. The latest season of the comedy talk show features the company's resident TTRPG expert, Brennan Lee Mulligan, chatting with a new suite of guests.</p><p>The new <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer provides more of what fans have come to expect from the Dropout crew. For those not aware, <em>Adventuring Academy</em> is a talk show where Brennan Lee Mulligan, the mind behind the platform's comedic actual play anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dimension-20-gladlands-is-mad-max-if-everyone-wasnt-being-so-rude-interview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>, casually chats with a host about tabletop gaming.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These talks span a wide number of topics in regards to play for both new and experienced players. How do you handle a player character dying? How do you make a memorable character in your game? How much worldbuilding is too much? What steps can you take to make your players feel comfortable and safe when undertaking dark or intense scenarios?&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, these episodes can veer into comedic asides and passionate hot takes. That doesn't appear to have changed in the <em>Adventuring Academy</em> Season 7 trailer. A guest declaring their dislike of Gandalf from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Brennan's slightly changed relationship with snacking and almonds. The edict of "mandatory queerness." It is all in line with Dropout's distinct irreverent brand.</p><p>The new season's guests are a mix of Dropout regulars and other creatives in the space. They include Vic Michaelis, Robbie Daymond, Oscar Montoya, Kimia Behpoornia, Aabria Iyengar, Emily Friedman, Mica Burton, Quinns Smith, and Jasper William Cartwright.</p><p>Overall, the line-up is consistent with past seasons. Prior guests have included Dropout talent like Jacob Wysocki, Sam Reich, Lou Wilson, and Ally Beardsley, as well as other professional tabletop creatives like Jasmine Bhullar, Deborah Ann Woll, Dave Walters, Marisha Ray, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-campaign-4-trailer-introduces-us-to-land-of-araman" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's</a> own Matt Mercer.</p><p><em>Adventuring Academy </em>Season 7 premieres exclusively on Dropout on February 20th.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

In the interview, Horii is asked directly about the decision to recast certain characters in Kiwami from their original Japanese actors. His general response as to why he recast both Hamazaki and Rikiya Shimabukuro is that while it would "certainly be safer not to recast them and avoid online criticism," the studio "felt there was no use being afraid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Horii goes on to say that they based their decision on who they most wanted to see perform. When asked directly about Kagawa playing Hamazaki, this is what Horii had to say:</p><blockquote>Hamazaki is a sleazy, persistent, and militant yakuza, right? Since he isn't an explosive character like Kanda, when we tried to think of someone who makes you go, "This guy's a creep," naturally it was Kagawa – that was the main factor. Kagawa's acting is fun to watch. Even when he's chopping a pig's feet off with a chef's knife, it has a slimy feel. That feeling permeates his performance, so it brings a freshness to the scene and made it feel really fun.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Kagawa's casting as Hamazaki has been met with anger from Yakuza fans due to the actor having been <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/entertainment/actor-teruyuki-kagawa-accused-of-sexual-harassment-tied-the-knot-in-2022" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused by multiple women</a> of <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault</a>, with one woman coming forward with what seems to be photographic evidence of the incident. In 2022, Kagawa <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/08/26/national/teruyuki-kagawa-groping-apology/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted to and apologized</a> for one of the incidents, but another of his accusers has <a href="https://www.dailyshincho.jp/article/2022/12271701/?all=1&amp;page=2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said she received no apology</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement of Kagawa's casting, Yakuza fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1ns20eq/they_need_to_remove_kagawa_from_this_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacted in anger on social media</a>, getting #REMOVEKAGAWA trending on multiple networks and creating a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-teruyuki-kagawa-from-his-role-as-goh-hamazaki-in-yakuza-kiwami-3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org petition</a> that at the time of this writing has nearly 10,000 signatures. Fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1o0j7l7/rgg_studio_suppressing_removekagawa_on_instagram/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused RGG Studio</a> of suppressing the #REMOVEKAGAWA hashtag and deleting comments referencing the issue on its official Instagram page. And a number of them have pointed out that Sega has recast actors for offenses in the past - Pierre Taki was recast in Judgment back in 2019 after he was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/16/18409777/yakuza-judgment-new-actor-pierre-taki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested for cocaine possesssion</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up to this point, neither RGG Studio nor Sega has offered official comment on Kagawa's casting, nor the accusations - Horii's answer is the first statement that's been offered on the subject. However, Sega did <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=lJmH7GkM8lqeVkMR&amp;v=37mtmF0FrPI&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publish a trailer on its official YouTube</a> after the wave of criticism, which introduced the Japanese voice cast and opened on a longer clip of Hamazaki. IGN reached out to Sega for additional comment ahead of this story, but did not hear back in time for publication.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>1428589</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Aftermath remains a humble mom ‘n’ pop ‘n’ two cats operation, but we have grand ambitions. Slowly but surely, we grow more powerful every day. Thanks to your subscriber dollars, for which we’re eternally grateful, we’re now able to welcome two new writers into our regular rotation. You might have heard of them.</p><p>Former (until, you guessed it, layoffs) The Verge reporter Ash Parrish and prolific freelancer Joshua Rivera will soon be contributing to Aftermath on a regular basis! Ash is gonna be blogging one day per week, and Joshua is the monthly columnist <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>prophesied in our subscriber goals</u></a>. Both have written <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><u>excellent</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry/"><u>pieces</u></a> for Aftermath before, if you’d like a sample of what’s to come. We couldn’t be more excited to have them wandering the labyrinthine halls of our headquarters, by which I mean Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot emphasize enough that your subscriptions made this all possible, just as they did when we brought on Isaiah and Nicole as regular contributors last year. However, in the interest of disclosure, I will now share with you some less thrilling news: Our budget is pretty much tapped! We have <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/"><u>even grander long-term plans</u></a> – for example, hiring people full-time across multiple disciplines (and doing so at a wage that’s actually <em>livable</em>) – but we’ll need a pretty big boost to realize them.&nbsp;</p><p>This is where you come in: Consider <a href="https://aftermath.site/#/portal/"><u>subscribing</u></a> if you haven’t already! Or tell your friends! At 5,000 paying subscribers, there is still ample room for this beautiful baby website to grow. If even a small fraction of the over-100,000 who follow us on social media or who’ve signed up for our free newsletters subscribed tomorrow, we’d be set. As is, we’re doing our best, and regardless of what the future brings, we can promise you that we’ll continue to do so. Further, we recognize that times are tough. Any support you can give – even if that means only an email address – is nonetheless appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’d like to get to know Ash and Joshua better, you can listen to the latest episode of our weekly podcast, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>. We discuss our shared histories at Kotaku, as well as current beats and interests (ask Ash about monster fucking). Then we delve into the media landscape at large, which can’t even go a single week without, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/"><u>The Washington Post laying off hundreds of people</u></a>. Next our light and breezy conversation takes us to Epstein Island thanks to alleged <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><u>communications with the convicted sex criminal</u></a> from individuals in and around the world of games. Oh, we also talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><u>this week’s Nintendo Direct</u></a> and <em>Overwatch</em>, which is <a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-this-man-were-all-so-tired/"><u>no longer <em>Overwatch 2</em></u></a>, but is also not <em>Overwatch 1</em>.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually <em>buy The Washington Post</em>.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Now I have been laid off for the first time in my adult life, and rather than freaking out knowing what the landscape is like – knowing that there’s a very good possibility I will never have a full-time job like the one I left again – I’m not really that worried about it. I’m fighting against things I can’t control, so I’m gonna do the things that are within my control. I know my work is good; people wouldn’t ask me for it if it wasn’t. So I have to find more of those people, and I think I’m gonna have to at least try to see if I have the strength to continue that. We’ll see.</p><p>It’s not good advice [to other writers who might be struggling]. You can’t eat that kind of advice. You can’t eat hope. Because it’s really cliche when people ask you “How do you do this when it’s all so bad?” and I’m like “You just have to keep doing it and hope.” That has to be your main fuel, because it’s not gonna come from anywhere else because it is so damn bleak. And if you don’t got it, you don’t got it. That’s fine. It sucks because that’s not really actionable. You just have to have it. But it is what it is. I hate saying that shit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Next Aftermath subscriber goal: a machine that dispenses edible hope.&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, what about you considering that you’ve been in the freelance realm for a while longer and have had to hop between those ice floes more regularly? What does that actually look like for you?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> It’s tough. When I left Polygon about a year and a half ago, it wasn’t quite starting over, but it felt a little bit like that. I was at Polygon three-ish, almost four years. Even that stretch of time, it felt like the scene had changed entirely. Even now, I feel like I’m figuring it out every day. I feel like quitting every day! It’s very much like Goku training at 100x gravity.</p><p>But I don’t know. For me it’s a sense of malcontent; I have this restless itch to say something – to figure things out and put out work that means something to people. That helps them understand the world and the things they engage with a little better. This feeling of being useful and being responsible with the platforms that I have in the time that I have them.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know how much longer that is. We’re seeing institutions collapse all around us, and we can only respond so quickly. Like, Aftermath has been growing to the point that y’all could bring me on for a monthly column, but to replace some of the outlets that we’re losing is gonna take a lot of work and time and investment. Every day I’m pretty conscious of the fact that I could be out of the game tomorrow, so what should I say today while I can? That’s kind of what I think about.</p><p>Which makes it sound like my work is a little more serious than it is. Sometimes I do find the value of being a fucking goober – and not letting them beat that out of me.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-game-publishers-outersloth-pocketpair/"><div><p>Meet The Unconventional Publishers Trying To Unfuck The Games Industry</p><p>Developers turned publishers like Innersloth and Pocketpair are leveraging their success to help other indie games thrive.</p><p><span>Ash Parrish</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hands-on-does-hollow-knights-free-upgrade-make-a-difference-on-switch-2</link>
            <guid>1428577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1b90ae549be74"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Key Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b90ae549be74/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition-key-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>"Oh no, not again..." I say as I boot up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, "Am I about to play through this game for a third time?"</p>
<p>I didn't really need much to entice me back into the world of Hallownest, but after downloading the free upgrade within hours of it releasing, I somehow lost three hours of my life going through Godhome, dabbling in some Pantheons, and getting my backside handed to me by Pure Vessel and Absolute Radiance.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've picked up Team Cherry's game since I beat the sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, and I was surprised at how quickly I slipped back into The Knight's very-different skillset. His steadier movement and smaller build is more deliberate and requires a different mindset than Hornet does, but it turns out, I haven't lost those skills I developed way back when I first played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>.</p>
<p>That meant I could focus on everything this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is bringing to the table and while it isn't a huge upgrade, you can't complain — this is free, after all (if you already own the Switch 1 game, at least. But the full game is also very cheap).</p>
<figure data-uuid="516aabdad17b9"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/516aabdad17b9/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upgrade focuses entirely on the look and performance of the Metroidvania: now, on Switch 2, you can play Hollow Knight at 4K resolution (docked) and 120fps, if your TV supports it. Handheld, the resolution has been bumped to 1080p, <em>and</em> that 120fps is also an option. You can toggle the frame rate in the in-game options.</p>
<p>To most, 120fps isn't going to be noticeable, but like when I played Silksong on Switch 2, I <em>felt</em> a difference in my gameplay almost immediately. I was missing enemy swipes by mere pixels and perfectly timing pogos and nail slashes at the perfect distance more frequently. The Knight felt snappier, despite being a lot slower than Hornet.</p>
<p>That feeling was universal across both docked and handheld for me; whether I was exploring the glowing confines of Crystal Peak or soaking up the rain in City of Tears or expertly dodging attacks from the Sisters of Battle, it reminded me of what a <em>joy</em> Hollow Knight is to play, even in the wake of its improved sequel.</p>

<p>But part of that might also come from a lack of input delay, something which fans complained about in the original Switch release. I shared some brief thoughts in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">our original review</a>, but it's something I genuinely never noticed until I started playing on Switch 2, and tackled the same few bosses on both consoles. I was noticeably better and more-reactive on the newer console; even when I was dying, I was consistently closer to beating the boss each time on Switch 2.</p>
<p>The star of the upgrade, however, is the improved visuals. Beyond simply bumping the resolution, which makes the game look much-more crisp, Team Cherry has also added "additional effects", which is a modest way of saying improved the lighting, the level of colour (particularly the shades of black and grey), and highlighted more details in the backdrops.</p>
<p>Now Crystal Peak's gems glimmer with an even more vibrant purple, contrasting even stronger with the dim lamps and the darker areas of the map. Greenpath's lush, verdant foliage feels more alive with deeper greens and shinier thorns. Even the Crossroads' dim, grey hallways appear more detailed, and when it's eventually overrun with infection, the orange puss glow feels like it's bursting out of the screen.</p>
<figure data-uuid="702d02162f453"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/702d02162f453/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hollow Knight was already a pretty game, but now it's much more in-line with the colour and lighting of Silksong. There are so many little things in the upgrade that give Hallownest a new glow to it; it actually has me itching to replay the whole thing again, perhaps even for a Steel Soul run.</p>
<p>The thing is, for most — especially on a first-time playthrough — you're probably not going to notice much of a difference, because many of the upgrades are small. The game was already 60fps on Switch, just with a blurrier resolution in handheld, and the jump to 120fps isn't as easy to notice as it is from 30 to 60. And the input delay is only really noticeable if you've played the game on other platforms or if you're a speedrunner.</p>
<p>So yes, Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition might not be a transformative upgrade, but it is <em>free</em>, and if you're paying attention, you'll notice and love all of the little tweaks and improvements. Honestly, the handheld visuals alone make this more than enough for me to recommend Switch 2 as the place to play the game now. Perhaps this is the platform where I will finally make the time to conquer the Pantheon of Hallownest...</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2aed5b31c070"><a title="Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2aed5b31c070/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Does it look or feel different on Switch 2 to you? Are you jonesing for a replay as well? Or will this be the time you <em>finally</em> dip your toes into the game? Vote away!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s time for the weekend to roll around, but before you can start relaxing or doing whatever you planned to do today, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle! That’s why I’m here, actually. I’ve got the quickest and best NYT Connections hints and answers that you need to dominate today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Just read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today, February 7!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-7">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 7)</h2>



<p>Today’s NYT Connections is <strong>really </strong>weird. It’s not words, but symbols, which means it’s one of the toughest NYT Connections puzzles I’ve ever seen. Here’s what you’re trying to solve today:</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Roll the dice</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – It’s all just mathematics</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Used in grammatical fields</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Simple letters</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 7:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-february-7-972">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, February 7 (#972)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DIVIDED BY, EQUALS, MINUS, PLUS</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – COLON, ELLIPSIS, PERIOD, QUOTATION MARK</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – I, L, T, X</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Prepare for some different nightmares in REANIMAL, with the review embargo set to lift in February. It’s a new stomping ground but familiar territory for Tarsier Studios, and fans of the studio will be hoping the developer can catch new lightning in a bottle.</p>



<p>When a new game arrives in all CAPS LOCKS, you know it’s game over. If you don’t know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tarsier-studios/" id="1858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tarsier Studios</a>, it’s the genius company behind the sleep-interrupting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/little-nightmares/" id="985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares</a> I &amp; II. A subtle blend of horror, puzzles, and psychological warfare: So family-friendly, then. </p>



<p>If you want to know if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/reanimal/" id="170941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REANIMAL</a> is for you, then read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-date-explained">REANIMAL Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run! Credit to Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming has been told that the review embargo for REANIMAL is February 11.</strong></p>



<p>The good people at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/thq-nordic/" id="1461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic</a> have informed Insider Gaming that you can look forward to reviews dropping on the 11th—two days before launch day!</p>

</ul>



<p>As usual, many reviews will be dropping, and you’ll quickly be able to get a sense of what REANIMAL’s about, with Metacritic and OpenCritic rounding up reviews and giving you the critical perspective.</p>



<p>Everyone knows that critics don’t know what they’re talking about, though! So, make sure to give REANIMAL a fair crack of the whip, whatever happens, and judge for yourself. If you don’t, it might come back to haunt your dreams.</p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-review-embargo-release-times">REANIMAL&nbsp;Review Embargo Release Times</h2>



<p><strong>The review embargo for REANIMAL follows a similar release time pattern to most other big releases, dropping at 8 PM PT. If you’re based elsewhere, the time will differ slightly.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>Enough chit-chat, here’s a table showing you the review embargo release times for key regions.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center"><strong>Region / Time Zone</strong></th><th data-align="center"><strong>REANIMAL Review Embargo Dates &amp; Release Times</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 PM—February 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 AM—February 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 AM—February 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To reiterate, there’s ample time until REANIMAL’s February 13 release date. If the company’s previous work on Little Nightmares is anything to go by, some pretty good scores are inevitable.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SEGA Taps HBO’s The Last of Us’ Dina to Lead its Next “Tentpole” Film Franchise, The House of the Dead]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/isabela-merced-star-sega-the-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation/</link>
            <guid>1428547</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Isabela Merced</strong>, who you'll recognize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-finale-sees-big-decline-over-season-1/">as <strong>Dina</strong> from <strong>HBO's The Last of Us</strong></a> and <strong>Hawkgirl</strong> in <strong>James Gunn's</strong> recent <strong>Superman</strong> film, has been chosen to star in <strong>SEGA's</strong> upcoming film adaptation of its classic zombie franchise, <strong>The House of the Dead</strong>.</p>



<p>Confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, Merced will lead the adaptation, which is set to be written and directed by <strong>Paul W.S. Anderson</strong>, who is right at home in a gore-filled zombie world, as he's arguably most known for directing the <strong>Resident Evil</strong> films that star <strong>Milla Jovovich</strong> (who also happens to be his wife).</p>



<p>The report adds that SEGA sees the adaptation as "<em><strong>a top SEGA priority</strong></em>" and that the company wants to make it a successful and immersive franchise similar to the success of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-movie-becomes-top-grossing-game-adaptation-of-all-time-at-the-box-office/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></strong> movies, while making it a "<em><strong>fresh take</strong></em>" on the franchise.</p>



<p>"<em>The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years</em>," said Anderson, "<em>and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart. We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that SEGA has created over a whole series of films</em>."</p>



<p>SEGA executive and producer <strong>Toru Nakahara</strong> added, "<em>Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly,</em> <em>bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen. With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Story Kitchen</strong>, a production company that'll also be working on the film that's already got its hands in other video game to film/TV adaptations, namely <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/my-lara-croft-is-not-a-sex-bombshell-says-sophie-turner/">Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider show</a></strong>, added, "<em>We're thrilled to bring together Isabela, Paul, Jeremy, and SEGA, alongside our partners at Rocket Science and CAA Media Finance. It's a powerhouse group coming together for a truly iconic property</em>."</p>



<p>With this production still seemingly in early stages of its development, it'll be a while before we see Merced take center stage here. In the meantime, it seems like her schedule might open up sooner than later for it, if <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO boss <strong>Casey Bloys</strong> is correct about his estimate on how many more seasons The Last of Us will get.</a></p>



<p>The last time we saw anything from The House of the Dead was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-house-of-the-dead-remake-is-coming-to-pc-playstation-xbox-and-stadia-on-april-28/">a remake that arrived back in 2022</a></strong>. If this film adaptation finds the success that SEGA and company hope it does, we may be in for a new generation of games to go along with the films.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What if I told you a game of <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> didn’t have to take place in 1920s New England? What if it could, for example, take place in the neon-soaked world of 1980s Japan? Sounds pretty rad, right? Well dreams come true (whether we want them to or not)! I previously reviewed the fabulous <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Cthulhu: Arkham</em></a>, and was thrilled to receive a review copy of the brand-new adventure module <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-hardcover/?srsltid=AfmBOorE18GDqZ_l9nqFt_Xb8c97pIqO4m82Rcwi7SXQzF1c0TIWPPKo" rel="nofollow"><em>The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em></a> from Chaosium.</p><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is the first of two supplemental books for <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> set in 1980s Japan. Consisting of three standalone adventures (which can also each be strung together for a longer narrative), the game sees players tracking down The Sutra of Pale Leaves, a strange religious scripture with otherworldly origins.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The book begins with a very detailed look into 1980s Japan, describing in general details the culture, how society reacted to an economic bubble, and close-up views of various aspects of daily life. Like all books in Chaosium’s <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> line, it feels well-researched, inviting you into a world that feels real and tangible (before things get extremely unreal and intangible, of course).</p><p>From there, readers will find valuable information about key characters, an overview of the plot, and rules for tracking a very specific and secret status effect throughout the campaign.</p><p><strong>WARNING: </strong>If you’re interested in <em>playing</em> this game vs. <em>running</em> this game as a keeper, I suggest you turn back now. I can’t talk about the book without spoiling at least <em>some</em> of the mystery and surprise here! Okay, you’ve been warned, here we go!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>What’s Going On With This Sutra of Pale Leaves?</strong></h2><p>While the Sutra of Pale Leaves seems to be a very old, obtuse religious text, it’s actually a kind of memetic virus created by the Prince of Pale Leaves, better known to Mythos fans as The King in Yellow.&nbsp;</p><p>Trapped underground in his home world, he seeks to infect Earth with this mind-virus by exposing as many people as possible to the Sutra of Pale Leaves.</p><p>This is where our investigators come in, though they’ll have no idea at the start of the adventure that that’s what they’re up against.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-cops-large.jpeg?itok=YhwO_3c2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1042" height="712">

  </picture><p>In fact, they could go an entire adventure (they call them Chapters in the book) without realizing the Sutra is actually a problem - such is the insidious nature of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><p>As the investigators explore 1980s Japan in the three included scenarios presented in this book (there’s another book in this setting with an additional four adventures also available called <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-2-carcosa-manifest-hardcover/" rel="nofollow"><em>Carcosa Manifest</em></a>), they’ll slowly gain Exposure Points (which are kept secret from the investigators) by coming into contact with the Sutra.&nbsp;</p><p>As these points accumulate, they’ll become more and more under the sway of the Prince of Pale Leaves.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-tokyo-large.jpeg?itok=6u25ODEG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1280" height="762">

  </picture><p>This creates a wonderfully tense, running problem that the investigators may have little awareness of (especially at the start), and as they begin to realize the danger of coming into contact with the Sutra in all its forms, they’ll have to balance the necessity of interacting with the text against the perils of infecting their minds further with it.</p><h2><strong>What Adventures are included in </strong><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>Included in <em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising </em>are three distinct adventures that can be played solo or chained together to form a longer campaign. I’ll speak briefly here about the flavor and general thrust of each one.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-cthulhu-the-sutra-of-pale-leaves-twin-suns-rising-baku-large.jpeg?itok=qkAG0t93 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="916" height="566">

  </picture><p>First up is <strong>Dream Eater</strong>, in this adventure the investigators are called to a small town outside of Tokyo to help uncover the root cause of bad dreams plaguing the town. As they uncover more, they’ll learn that a Baku (a Japanese supernatural creature known for devouring dreams) is feeding on nightmares caused by exposure to the Sutra.</p><p>This Baku’s presence threatens the Prince of Pale Leaves, as he doesn’t want his nightmares gobbled up - and so the investigators, who have little foreknowledge of any of the goings on with the Sutra (especially if this adventure is played first), may unwittingly end up helping <em>defeat</em> the Baku! Starting slow without thrusting the players into the rush of big city Tokyo, this adventure is great when it serves as the first one played in a longer campaign.</p><p>Next up is <strong>Fan Fiction</strong>, where a talented indie manga artist has turned the Sutra into a manga to increase its viral appeal. Knowing that the Sutra as a sacred religious text won’t reach the masses, this new approach is sure to spread its influence.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>But when the adventure starts, the threat of this manga may not seem overtly apparent, as a twisted off-shoot and poorly made copy of the manga has been making the rounds, distorting the original viral code of the Sutra with disastrous consequences.</p><p>Third and final adventure in this book is <strong>The Pallid Masks of Tokyo</strong>, which begins with the ghastly discovery of a corpse in one of the nightlife districts of Tokyo. But there’s a catch… the body is completely faceless, with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears!</p><p>This adventure will take investigators briefly through the seedy underbelly of Tokyo before plunging them into a psychiatric ward where machinations are in place to create an army of faceless servants for the Prince of Pale Leaves!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em><strong>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</strong></em><strong> - Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p><em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising</em> is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting run of adventures and settings in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> I’ve read in a long time. The shift into 1980s Japan is a breath of fresh air, and I love how heady the overall conceit of the campaign feels.</p><p>This isn’t cultists trying to bring a big octopus monster out of the ocean in New England, it’s a dedicated conspiracy in Tokyo trying to blend power, indulgence, and religious and spiritual fanaticism together to virally infect the psyches of as many everyday people as possible. The threat is always immediate <em>and</em> looming, and it feels complicated and conflicted in a way we seldom see in <em>any</em> tabletop roleplaying game.</p><p>And while the scope, depth, and somewhat sandbox style of adventure writing here might feel daunting for new players, I cannot recommend this book enough to players familiar with <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, or for experienced TTRPG players looking to dip their toes into the system, but aren’t interested in the Roaring ‘20s vibe of the core game.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of </em>Call of Cthulhu: The Sutra of Pale Leaves - Twin Suns Rising<em> used in the creation of this review was provided by Chaosium.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cyber-boi-youtuber-leak-lawsuit-2000666474</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has allegedly stated that a “very big American company” called Ritual Network, a YouTube and TikTok management agency which is actually based in the United Kingdom, is behind a more than $1 million campaign to continue smearing the critically panned 2025 open-world flop</span><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a> reports that <span>Gerhard spoke about the alleged conspiracy </span><span>in an internal meeting with other Build a Rocket Boy staff. Per an </span><span>alleged recording of his remarks, Gerhard supposedly referred to Ritual Network as “a bunch of gangsters,” and also directly named YouTuber Cyber Boi as one of the “influencers” involved in the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>smear campaign. </span></p>

 <p><span>Cyber Boi is the content creator who was recently threatened with a “formal cease and desist demand” by Gerhard, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>via the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server last week</span></a><span>, following the release of a now-deleted video about ex-Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies and the Epstein files (<a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340">Benzies stated this week that he’s never met Epstein before</a>). </span><span><em>Kotaku</em> can confirm that an email address recently listed on Cyber Boi’s YouTube channel did belong to Ritual Network.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, Gerhard’s reported claim that Ritual Network is a “very big American company” appears to be false, as the company lists Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire as its registered address. It seemingly employs fewer than 20 individuals. Also, Ritual Network’s publicly available tax returns state that its net current assets in February 2025, four months before <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 2025 release, were somewhere around £800,000, or roughly €920,000. That’s 80,000 shy of the 1 million euro sum reportedly alleged in the recording</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Gerhard stated during the internal meeting that Ritual Network and the content creators they allegedly paid “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” for criminal charges including “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.” The purported video call also made mention of an “enhanced cybersecurity software” called Teramind, which had been installed on Build a Rocket Boy employees’ work systems without their prior knowledge.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning YouTuber drama into future <em>MindsEye</em> content</h2> <p><span>If true, that sounds an awful lot like the sort of futuristic, dystopian side plot that could be featured within the narrative of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Funnily enough, Gerhard also apparently stated that he wishes to use the names of those associated with Ritual Network in a <em>MindsEye</em> mission in the future. “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative,” he reportedly said. “We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.” </span></p> <p><span>In an official statement to </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>, Ritual Network stated that they are “not involved in the matter” and that they are also unaware of “any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.”</span></p>

 <p>Build a Rocket Boy isn’t backing down from its allegations, however. “Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in <em>MindsEye</em>,” a spokesperson for the studio told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</p> <p>Build a Rocket Boy is ostensibly in the middle of trying to reboot the failed 2025 blockbuster. <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008">A surprise February 4 update</a> was pitched as part of</span><span> “a reset for the brand and the title” which will kick off the beginning of a “new era” for <em>MindsEye</em>. The shooter still has a less-than-50-percent positive rating on Steam and, at the time of this writing, only 40 concurrent players in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p>The PS1 was an unrivaled time for soundtracks that go incredibly hard.

		<p>An internal video seen by Tom Henderson of<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"> Insider Gaming</a> is said to have shown&nbsp;Build a Rocket Boy CEO Mark Gerhard telling staff they had “caught the guys” who, he alleges, sabotaged the launch of MindsEye.</p>
<p>The meeting took place in January this year, during which Gerhard states that a “very big American company” is behind the plot, but “it’s probably not the company you’re thinking of.”</p>


<p>The campaign is alleged to have been run by Ritual Network, a UK based company, and they had been paying three unnamed journalists, several influencers and quite astoundingly, Build a Rocket Boy employees, all of whom worked to trash the game. Gerhard explain that they will all be served criminal complaints in person for &nbsp;“espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.”</p>
<p>“Everyone who’s involved has real problems, including the company behind it. This is the start of our comeback,” he said. That comeback will, quite amazingly,&nbsp; include using the names of the alleged criminals in an upcoming spy mission for the game.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some fun with it,” said Gerhard.. “Let’s tell the community the story before it even plays out in court. So, you know, I think this is not us being the victim.”</p>

<p>Insider Gaming spoke to <a href="https://www.ritualnetwork.com/">Ritual Network</a> who gave this response.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ritual Network is a creator support platform and is not involved in the matter you referenced. We are not aware of any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims. Any suggestion that Ritual Network is connected to these allegations is incorrect.</p></blockquote>
<p>MindsEye was released without any review copies being made available. It has a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37/100 on Metacritic from 14 critics </a>reviews and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/user-reviews/">2.5/10</a> from user reviews, including 457 negative reviews.&nbsp; Those alleged influencers clearly earned their alleged money.</p>
<p>I played MindsEye on PS5 two months after release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/08/what-we-played-battlefield-6-skycards-mindseye/">you can read my thoughts here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile games have existed for decades, but the market has grown immensely in recent years. So we decided it’s time to figure out which mobile game you think is the best of all time with a March Madness–style bracket, presented by our friends at McDonald’s and their limited-time Hot Honey sauce, which will make your faves more perfect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket is made up of 32 entries divided into two categories. On one side are classics like Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Doodle Jump, and Candy Crush. On the other are modern hits like Genshin Impact, Balatro, Fortnite, and Roblox. But which game deserves to be crowned as the GOAT? Only you can tell us that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bracket will pit games against each other 1v1, with the winner of each matchup moving on to the next round. All the matchups in each round will be done at the same time, with voting conducted through polls on the bottom of the page you’re currently on as well as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/igndotcom/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Instagram stories</u></a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Zombie Survival Game HumnanitZ officially Launches into 1.0 on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zombie-survival-game-humnanitz-officially-launches-into-10-on-steam</link>
            <guid>1428496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Isometric open-world zombie survival sandbox game HumanitZ first entered Steam Early Access in September 2023. In the more than two years since then, it’s gotten 18 major updates and countless patches. And now, it’s reached a new milestone: It’s out of Early Access, and Version 1.0 includes a visual and structural overhaul on top of all the previous improvements.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz3-1770330416664.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">HumanitZ takes place in a zombie-ravaged world with an emphasis on long-term progression and player choice. You can scavenge ruined cities, build bases, and try to outlast the zombies (known as Zeeks) and potentially other survivors (if you so choose). The whole game can be played solo, but there are also optional co-op, PvE, and PvP modes available on dedicated and player-hosted servers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a variety of environments across the open world, including big city streets, suburbs, farms, and forests. And you can mold those environments to suit your needs and help you survive, with several options available to you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">HumanitZ 1.0 Locations</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, you can raid a city, clear out the Zeeks, and claim an abandoned building to then turn into a fortified base using the building and crafting systems. Or you can stay away from the city and use farming, hunting, fishing, and foraging to create a self-sustaining homestead. Or you can constantly stay on the move, surviving off the resources you gather and never putting down roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These choices are all viable, but come with different levels of risk. Cities tend to be packed with necessary resources but are also crawling with Zeeks, leaving you with very little room for error. While building up your farmstead will see fewer Zeeks but runs the risk of sapping you of resources before it becomes self-sustaining. And you’ll never be able to completely avoid danger. Zombies and other hostile NPCs are constantly roaming the open world, so even if you choose to stay away from the city, you have to remain vigilant.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz1-1770330484497.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This focus on player choice has always been at the core of HumanitZ, with extensive updates and fine-tuning during Early Access. Version 1.0 has continued to build on those ideas with a broad round of refinements, upgrades, and new content. The most obvious example is its graphical overhaul, with fully remastered maps, upgraded lighting, new character models, and updated environments.  There are also several gameplay improvements, including new skill trees, the ability to multiclass, more diverse zombie types, special ammo, new equipment, new vehicles, and countless other new additions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz4-1770331040070.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while HumanitZ will always be an open-world sandbox, there are optional quests that can provide guidance to those of us who like a bit more structure. These quests will lead you to new areas (some of which were previously undiscoverable), where you can learn the lore behind the zombie outbreak and the horrors it’s inflicted. These quests won’t force you down a linear path, they’re just there to give you some guide rails if you want them, and they can be ignored or done at whatever pace you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can choose how hard the experience is, too. Difficulty can be tuned across everything from season length and day-night cycles to Zeek respawn rates, companion health and damage, airdrops, and dynamic AI events. You can also turn on permadeath, meaning that if you die once, your game is over and you’ll have to start over again from the beginning. And for you masochists out there, you can opt into the new afflictions that add a persistent debuff and long-term consequences on top of all those modifiers, cranking the difficulty up as far as you dare</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/05/press-hz2-1770330971672.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Version 1.0 signals a major milestone in HumanitZ’s development, it’s far from the end. The dev team has made it clear that you can expect post-launch support, with patches and updates to add new content and address player feedback. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766060/HumanitZ/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>HumanitZ on Steam</u></a> now, where you can also read the patch notes and see all the details of everything that was added and refined in the Version 1.0 release.
