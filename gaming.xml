            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> fans have pledged more than $2m to ensure a new, official board game version of CD Projekt Red's role-playing game is made.
</p>
<p>
The crowdfunding campaign for Cyberpunk 2077 - The Board Game on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game">GameFound</a> obliterated its initial $100k goal in just 10 minutes and four seconds. As of writing, almost £2.1m has been pledged, and counting. 16 days of the campaign remain.
</p>
<p>
This tabletop version of Cyberpunk 2077 sees you taking on missions and follow branching, replayable stories as V, Panam, Jackie or Judy across Night City. It's been created by Game On Board, the company that previously made a couple of official The Witcher board games, with support from CD Projekt Red itself.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
A standard edition of the Cyberpunk 2077 board game will set you back $79 (about £60) and include stretch goals that would otherwise cost extra once the base game is launched. 
</p>
<p>
A fancier deluxe edition costs $139 (about £106), upgrades various tokens from cardboard to plastic, and includes deluxe stretch goal rewards.
</p>
<p>
Back in the world of video games, work has begun on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">may finally include the franchise's long-awaited multiplayer option</a>. Don't expect Cyberpunk 2078, or whatever the game ends up being called, for a while though. The bulk of CD Projekt is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">currently focused on its upcoming fourth major The Witcher game</a>, which is set to release first.

<p>As with previous months, five percent of Choice membership will go towards charitable causes.</p>
<p>This month, Humble is supporting Action Against Hunger, which is committed to ending world hunger. "The organisation works to save the lives of malnourished children while providing communities with access to safe water and sustainable solutions to hunger," Humble explains. "With 30 years of expertise in emergency situations of conflict, natural disaster, and chronic food insecurity, ACF runs life-saving programs in some 40 countries benefiting seven million people each year."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQGddOAZGLU">learn more about Action Against Hunger here</a>.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is an action-adventure game from Eidos-Montréal which gives us an original take on Marvel's oddball spacefaring family. "Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is enjoyable enough at times, but weighed down by a deluge of unnecessary systems and bullet-sponge combat," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-breezy-but-unfocused-action">Eurogamer's Guardians of the Galaxy review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guardians-of-the-galaxy-developer-addresses-square-enix-sales-expectations-how-it-wanted-to-create-a-new-marvel-ip">I spoke with the team behind Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> back in 2022 all about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s sales expectations and how it wanted to create a new Marvel IP.</p>
<p>Coral Island, meanwhile, is a tropical farm life sim heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s more modern take on the genre. However, it sets itself apart with a focus on ocean exploration and conservation.</p>
<p>Coral Island was published by Humble Games, and developer Stairway Games recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/coral-island-developer-blames-humble-games-layoffs-for-leaving-switch-port-in-a-place-of-uncertainty">blamed layoffs at the publisher for leaving its Switch port "in a place of uncertainty"</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, You Suck at Parking - which incidentally is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-include-big-rigs-in-space">leaving Xbox Game Pass later this month</a> - tasks players with parking their car as quickly as possible, regardless of any style of finesse. "It’s a hot race against the clock as you drift, cruise, and go airborne over 250 frustratingly fun, wild levels," the game's description boasts.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon%E2%80%99s-dogma-2-dlc-may-be-in-the-works-judging-from-some-recent-findings.971565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dragon's Dogma 2 DLC expansion seems to be in the works, and its reveal could be edging closer, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported on the Gaming Leaks subreddit, there's been some behind-the-scenes activity on Steam. According to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2054970/dlc/">Steam Database</a>, there have been some encrypted DLC updates that have only been affecting the game's main app, as well as multiple updates for an unnamed DLC pack that has been in the works for at least 5 months.</p>
<p>With this type of behind-the-scenes activity, there's usually something cooking, so it could definitely be the same for Dragon's Dogma 2. Still, without an official announcement, we should take everything with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>This month's Tokyo Game Show would be the perfect avenue to show how the Dragon's Dogma 2 project is still alive following the departure of its director <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/">Hideaki Itsuno</a>. The first game's Dark Arisen expansion, which turned the whole game into a memorable action RPG with tons of tweaks and improvements, was directed by Kento Kinoshita, who also worked as a lead designer on the sequel, so there's a good chance that he will lead the further development of the game and its potential expansions, and possibly a new entry in the series, from now on.</p>
<p>In its current state, Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely not the game that should have been. While the experience is fine for the most part, it feels more like a reboot of the original than a proper sequel, with some under-baked features that fail to reach their full potential. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>

</div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> was a game of stark and severe Brutalist aesthetics, and also, a game about playing scales with a trumpet, walljumping with a baseball bat and using a leafblower to fly. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">Snuck out over winter 2022</a>, it was a sombre but delightful freebie with immense though well-hidden imagination, in which your only explicit objective was to find a way out of a small concrete city.</p>
<p>Now, developers Lemaitre Bros are making a gott-dang 1v1 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> called Straftat, slated for release on 24th October 2024 with over 100 arenas. It's similarly in love with concrete, but it also has blunderbusses, dual-wielding, Gatling guns, corner-peeking, curved swords, cowboy hats and beehive hairdos.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Technically, this isn't news. Straftat has been public knowledge since last year - find some unedited WIP capture from March below. But this is the first time I've laid eyes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">the Steam page</a>, and I adhere to the epistemological position that reality only exists when it is observed. As such, I consider it entirely logical and coherent to assert that Straftat has <em>only</em> existed as of the writing of this news post. You're welcome.</p>
<figure>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDh05-A5Uvc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>There are several schools of thought on the name. One is that Straftat is German for "criminal offence", perhaps a reference to, like, an edgy Berlin club of some kind. There are certainly many offences being committed in the game, from crimes against windows (Straftat is part of the unofficial defenestration genre recently re-popularised by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>) to crimes against fashion.</p>
<p>Another take on the name is that it's an abbreviation of, like, "Strafe Tactics", a Modern Warfarelike techno-flourish that seems out of synch with the game's bleached and swooping vibes. And thirdly, there's the argument that Straftat is "Tat Farts" written backwards, which is the speculation I favour - it certainly describes a lot of free-to-play live service games. I'm not clear how Lemaitre Bros are funding development of Straftat, but then again, I wasn't clear how they funded development of Babbdi either - will they be selling those hats and hairdos or allowing player-trading, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike </a>and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a>? Whatever their approach is, I hope it carries on working.</p>
<p>I really like the pace and variety and energy of this, and it's a pleasure to see the developers' talent for first-person environments applied to such a vast album of maps, though I naturally have some concerns about diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Some of the maps are more suspenseful with fog and trees, almost Darkroot Garden-esque, while others are fleshed-out urban spaces with signage and props that might have been cribbed from Babbdi's infrastructure. The combat gives me flashbacks to the duelling communities of games like the Jedi Knight series. It doesn't look like there's any progression bullshit to worry over - just on-map power-ups. You can learn more over on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/qeMEaMEkDa">developer Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Too upbeat for a game with Brutalist architecture? You might prefer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazingly-grim-retro-sci-fi-android-spelunker-lorns-lure-finally-has-a-release-date">Lorn's Lure</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has revealed fresh details of its forthcoming RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, including its setting: Concordia.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-luigi-brothership-bringing-the-action-rpg-series-to-switch-this-year">announced at Nintendo's Direct in June</a>, marking the series' debut on Switch and latest game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-luigi-paper-jam-bros">Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam</a> on the 3DS in 2015. It could potentially be the final Mario game on the console before the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/a4000ce6-792e-49cb-8a9e-75497a691f4f">Nintendo Japan shared a blog post with new details</a> and, since then, a new trailer for the game has been released ahead of its launch on 7th November - see it below.</p>

<p>Concordia is a typically colourful world of all the elements and some new square-headed inhabitants.</p>
<p>Just don't confuse the name with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's Concord</a> - the reveal is certainly unfortunate timing.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Japanese blog</a>, Concordia is home to various "drifting islands" - I won't include the names due to translation inconsistencies. However, there's an island filled with displays of objects made by its residents; a tourist island dominated by a strangely shaped tree; an island of old buildings suffering from kidnapper birds; an urban metropolis island that looks inspired by Tokyo's Nakagin Capsule Tower; and an island that's half ice, half magma.</p>

<p>Further, the blog includes details on Mario and Luigi's combined attacks. For instance, their jump and hammer attacks can be combined with correct timing of button prompts for high damage. There are also Brother Attacks that consume Brother Points, including the familiar red shell and a lightning-infused dynamo attack.</p>

<p>If you've not played the Mario &amp; Luigi games, the series began with Superstar Saga on the Game Boy Advance. They're action-RPG games released for Nintendo's handheld consoles, unique in the way each brother is controlled individually with separate button prompts both during exploration and in turn-based combat.</p>
<p>The release of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership comes a year after the remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> and the release of the remastered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-so-brilliant-because-it-embraces-mario-for-the-blank-slate-he-is">Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</a> earlier this summer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>If I'm being honest, I can't remember much about the original Age of Mythology. I remember thinking it was a great game, but I've not played that twenty-two-year-old game in about five years, and even then, it was only a quick jump in. Playing Age of Mythology Retold has left me wondering a few things, such as "Was the campaign this long when it launched?", "why haven't they allowed for WASD movement of the camera?" "Will I ever play the online PVP mode?" and "What time is it?"</p>
<p>The answers to these questions were, in order, "Yes", "No", "No", and "For Zeus' sake, it's 2 am". That is to say that I did spend a lot of time getting absorbed into Age of Mythology Retold, as I do any good strategy game. Now, after we've had definitive editions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-definitive-edition-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iii-definitive-edition-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires III</a>, with a brand new entry in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-empires-iv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Empires IV</a>, how does a move to antiquity and fantasy stand?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Ra-Attack-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It's good. Let's get that right out of the way. Like the original, Age of Mythology Retold is good. It's hard to ruin what is sprucing up the old model, fixing glaring issues, doing all the cosmetics, and sending it out for one last show. Though this isn't a classic car show, this is a classic video game show, so the question will be what spruces have been made, and how will this impact the player?</p>
<p>Cosmetically, this has been improved in every way I can think of. The models are much higher quality, and the animations certainly feel like they have been improved. Environmentally, this gorgeous game makes the most of the fantastical settings - taking you from Atlantis to the depths of the underworld, Mount Olympus, Scandinavia, and more. Everything from the units you control, the buildings you build, and even the berries you harvest have retained the "mythology" feel but are close enough to a modern look that you won't have any complaints.</p>
<p>This is especially true when you cast god powers, which have great effects and stand out. Even more so, unlike in the original, these god powers are not limited to being one-shot. Before we cover more on the gameplay, stick to the cosmetics. The UI has also been improved, both minimalised and modernised. It doesn't take up as much of the screen but displays everything you need to see, and you can even see something as simple as the minimap improved by better use of colours.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Age of Mythology Retold also has a multitude of options when it comes to accessibility. Are you colourblind? No issues; let's start changing things. You can also add text narration, increase the contrast of things on the minimap, preview colours for building placement, a narrator for menus and in-game, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. I'm a firm believer in being as inclusive and accessible as humanly possible, and it's always fantastic to see such a range of options in any title, never mind a strategy title, which is always going to be more complicated than your general action adventure.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Greek-Battle-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the gameplay side, the developers (there are too many to list) have made a few improvements, tweaks, and additions. Not all of the additions are things I use, but the core is the villager priority system. Rather than directing your villagers onto specific resources, you can have the AI direct them based on pre-set ratios of food, wood and gold (though, oddly, this misses out on the fourth resource in favour). You can also custom-set the percentages and allow the AI to build farms. It could be a helpful system, but the few times I used it, my villagers put themselves in harm's way.</p>
<p>The other core change I did use is the allowance of god powers to be used more than once - which is also why the cap on favour has been lifted. The more you use a power, the more it costs, but we all know that having Zeus blast down your enemy is always worth allocating some villagers to pray at the temple. Linking into your link to the gods is the brand new wonder age; once you have built your wonder, god powers become cheaper, letting you create even more havoc on the battlefield.</p>
<p>These three things are just that, three, but they are wide-reaching. While I don't use the villager priority system, it must be a godsend for those who would rather focus on combat and not have to micromanage. Pun intended. Reusable god powers and the new wonder era add a new level to a great strategy game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AoMRT-Norse-Town-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If I have any issues with Age of Mythology Retold, I've encountered a few bugs here and there. It's nothing game-breaking, but sometimes it's just irritating. One is where the cursor will lock on one of the sub-cursors (as I call them); instead of a simple pointer, it will be stuck on the icon to build something, or it will be stuck on the attack icon. Other small issues</p>
<p>That is all I can say. The base was a great strategy game, and this keeps that base. A few new features have been added: one, which I don't use, but I can see the use, and two, which gives it a step up. Add to this vastly improved visuals, effects, and a much cleaner UI, and you have a game that I would recommend anybody pick up and play.</p>

<p>Age of Mythology Retold brings back a classic, with new - great - visuals, a new UI, and a few new gameplay features. While it does, for the most part, feel more like a remaster, there's still an incredible amount to love here, and the few new features the army of developers have added bring a whole new level to the game.</p>

			<span>Pros</span>

		<ul>
			<li>Much improved visuals, and UI, bringing it into the modern age.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, that 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter about Guardians Of The Galaxy-like space persons, will be taken offline on the 6th September. Anyone who bought it is being offered a full refund and it's been wiped off storefronts. All of this comes just shy of three weeks since the game dropped, with Sony citing a launch that "didn't land the way we'd intended".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/">announcement post</a>, Firewalk Studios thank those who supported the game, before broaching the bad news.</p>
<blockquote>"However, while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended. Therefore, at this time, we have decided to take the game offline beginning September 6, 2024, and explore options, including those that will better reach our players."</blockquote>
<p>Concord was announced at a PlayStation showcase last year. Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">immediately deemed it</a> yet another bland hero shooter, and honestly, it's hard to disagree. Even as RPS' resident FPSer and former Overwatch guides-er, I never harboured a desire to hop into any of Concord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-closed-beta-for-concord-sonys-new-hero-shooter-is-underway-and-the-open-beta-arrives-on-thursday">betas</a> and give it a whirl. I certainly don't speak for everyone, but I'd say a lot of us had our fill of Overwatchy hero shooters a <em>long</em> while back, so Concord wasn't so much filling a gap, but widening it.</p>
<p>I'd imagine Firewalk's option-exploration will result in the game returning to storefronts sporting a free-to-play label, or at least a heavy discount, given that it had a hefty £40 barrier to entry. I can't see them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wayfinder-is-ditching-its-free-to-play-live-service-model-to-become-a-paid-co-op-rpg-without-microtransactions">doing a Wayfinder</a> and rejigging the game's multiplayer to fit a co-op PVE experience… because there isn't a PVE element. So, the question is how much cheaper they'll make it, and how they'll rejig the game with monetisation in mind.</p>
<p>Either way, Concord's really up against it. Valve's not-so secret shooter/MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">proving popular</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is bearing down on us (I know it's not a live service, but it's still a big shooter, innit). In the face of all that, can a reborn Concord perform a switcheroo so grand that it pries people away from the live services they're already chained to? Only time will tell, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After PlayStation and Firewalk made the decision to pull Concord from sale two weeks after the hero-shooter made its debut, industry members have started to share their sympathies with the team involved.</p>
<p>Gears of War's Cliff "CliffyB" Bleszinski shared a short post on social media, reading: "Concord, I feel your pain."</p>
<p>Bleszinski previously set up Boss Key Productions, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cliff-bleszinski-announces-closure-of-lawbreakers-developer-boss-key">now defunct studio</a>, which released its own hero shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lawbreakers">LawBreakers</a>. Despite a big pre-release push by publisher Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawbreakers-developer-confirms-that-its-now-focussing-on-other-projects">LawBreakers flopped</a>, with its Steam concurrent player count peaking at 7482 in June 2017 when it launched via open beta.</p>
<p>In a follow up reply, Bleszinski noted his team had worked on LawBreakers for three years prior to its release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">Concord had reportedly been in development for eight</a>.</p>

<p>Former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> community manager Liana Ruppert said Concord has her "support" following yesterday's shutdown announcement.</p>

<p>Tango Gameworks creative director John Johanas shared a similar sentiment.</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> studio Remedy also posted following Concord's news. "Everybody working on Concord, hang in there," Puha wrote.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/1831219269146665224">second post</a>, Puha said he was often asked about sales (it has been estimated Concord <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">only sold around 25,000 copies across PS5 and PC</a>). "I sometimes get asked about selling games and I always say it’s really difficult these days. Something like 60 million PS5’s sold and Concord struggles to sell (I don’t know the numbers) as many others have," he wrote.</p>
<p>"Even selling half a million units these days is a challenge. Then you get megahits like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and no one is quite sure how it did as well as it did.

<p>Lastly, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad has shared his thoughts.</p>
<p>"The comments around Concord from right-wing gamers shows the power of collective self-deception," Ahmad wrote, following claims from some that Concord's muted launch was impacted by so-called 'wokeness'. "If you say delusional stuff about DEI enough times and build a conspiracy focused narrative, they start seeing that false narrative everywhere</p>

			<p>The Little Nightmares series is among the most unique gaming franchises running today, featuring gameplay that masterfully combines platforming and puzzle-solving with a creepy atmosphere that makes each adventure incredibly tense. After the second entry in the series, however, it looked like the franchise would be changing forever. Original developer Tarsier Studios left the franchise behind (and is now working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a> with THQ Nordic) after getting acquired by Embracer, passing the torch to Supermassive Games, a studio well-versed in horror games, for the development of Little Nightmares III.</p>
<p>During this year's Gamescom, I had the chance to try out the game, controlling a new character, Alone, and collaborating with another called Low controlled by another player, to escape the creepy Candy Factory and the old lady who seemed intent on eating the two. Right from the beginning of the demo, there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay. This was not a guarantee at all, given the development studio switch, so Bandai Namco, who owns the IP, definitely made the right choice, picking Supermassive Games to develop the game.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>Though very familiar, the Little Nightmares III experience does have some important differences over its predecessors. For starters, both Alone and Low can use weapons, a wrench, and bows and arrows to defeat enemies and complete certain puzzles, such as activating contraptions, hitting unreachable switches, and so on. The biggest change, however, is the introduction of co-op mechanics, which should impact the experience quite a bit.</p>
<p>"Should" is the right word to use at this point, as the Little Nightmares III Candy Factory demo did an excellent job showcasing how the game effortlessly feels like part of the series but did a much poorer job highlighting how co-op impacts the experience. The few puzzles that required two players to collaborate, such as opening heavy grates or moving stuff around to reach new areas, didn't look particularly inspired and might have easily been single-player puzzles, too, with some tweaks. If anything, the co-op mechanics were more of a hindrance, as during a stealth sequence set in an office where Alone and Low had to sneak past the aforementioned old lady to make an example, it was easier to mess up and have to restart the sequence from the beginning. Hopefully, future showings will do a much better job.</p>
<p>For the rest, as mentioned, it was business as usual in the short time I had with Little Nightmares III. I jumped on platforms. I completed some simple puzzles with the help of items found lying around. I avoided danger by hiding or frantically running away. All of this should please fans of the series quite a bit. Despite the departure of Tarsier Studios, there's no denying the series is in some very capable hands who fully understand what makes the series so peculiar.</p>
<p>Little Nightmares III is scheduled for a 2025 release (following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>) on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>It is 1959. The cold war is in full swing, television is taking over, and environments have just become fully destructible. What a time to be alive. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a> is a chaotic courier sim set in those heady days that sees the player barrelling around a "semi-open" US town as they take on absurd odd jobs. "From delivering a giant flailing Marlin, to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion," say the developers, "always expect the unexpected." It's maybe best understood by witnessing the moment in the trailer below where the player drifts right through a menswear store, bringing the whole building down. Yep, that looks like a good time. </p>

<p>Your demolitionist misdeeds will cause some trouble with the law and local townsfolk, it seems. "They will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable of ways," say the developers. It's being made by Swedish studio Far Out Games, a band of students who formed a studio some years back to "turn our school project into our dream game" and are now being published by Konami. Good work, young 'uns.</p>
<p>There's a tale to go with it all. You play as delivery boy Winston Green, who's described as a  "down-on-his-luck courier with a fiery temper and a mysterious past". It's suggested that there'll be some intrigue as his cargo gets wackier and wackier, and the idyllic town of St Monique starts to give up her secrets. </p>
<p>I think my favourite feature is how the citizens you've annoyed hang onto the back and sides of your vehicle with their legs flailing as the player takes another hard corner. Gee whiz, they sure are upset. You'll be able to leave your car and wander around on Winston's legs, GTA style, and you can unlock character upgrades like a useful bicycle. Your car can also get totalled (as seen in the trailer when the player gets badly bashed by boulder) but you'll have a means of reclaiming it. </p>
<p>It seems part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part old-school GTA. As someone who recently rediscovered the joys of absolutely caning it around in an old banger in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">best racing games</a>), I can get behind a little more vehicular destruction. There's no release date just yet, but we'll let you know. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Microsoft representative has confirmed through a new statement that Black Myth: Wukong’s “delay is not due to Xbox Platform limitations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> report, the Microsoft representative stated that the team is “excited about the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on the Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science” to release the game on their platforms. The representative added that they would “prefer not to comment on deals” made by their partners with other platform holders. However, they can confirm that the “delay is not due to the Xbox platform limitations”.</p>



<p>Microsoft issued a statement in response to concerns surrounding the game’s delay, which was attributed to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory leak issue</a> on Xbox consoles. Black Myth: Wukong was seemingly ‘indefinitely delayed’ as the developers are optimising it for the consoles.  Subsequently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-has-exclusivity-deal-with-playstation-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was claimed</a> that the delay on Xbox stemmed from an exclusivity agreement with PlayStation.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new report also speculates that Game Science and PlayStation could have a non-traditional exclusivity deal for Black Myth: Wukong; however, neither entity has confirmed this officially. At the moment, there is no release date for Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>

Ryan Ellis, director at Sony-owned developer Firewalk, said: "while many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognize that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn’t land the way we’d intended."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Soon after that announcement, reports indicated that Concord players were throwing Rivalry matches in a bid to earn experience points as fast as possible. Rivalry mode sees two teams of five players battle for dominance across best-of-seven single-life rounds. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work. Now, players are starting a match and immediately running off a platform to their doom, resulting in a win for the opposing team and the end of the round.</p><p>Rivalry matches are the perfect choice for this tactic. Win or lose, it rewards players with more experience points than other game modes. And because it’s the best-of-seven single-life rounds, as long as the whole team gets in on the act and each round takes about 30 seconds, you can finish a match in just a few minutes — again, as long as all players follow suit and you lose or win four matches in a row.</p><p>Thus, this is the quickest way to earn experience points in Concord, and thus the quickest way to earn that Platinum trophy (you need to get to reputation level 100, which takes hundreds of thousands of XP), with just two days left before the game shuts down. But be warned: your win percentage will take a hit if you keep deliberately losing. Still, that might not be much of a concern given Concord’s impending doom.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally every match of Rivalry in Concord rn because this is the fastest way to earn XP for the Platinum 😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/BZ12OV7lc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BZ12OV7lc1</a></p>— Radec (@realradec) <a href="https://twitter.com/realradec/status/1831041419756388429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>IGN has verified that Rivalry matches are currently being played out in this fashion. The race, it seems, is very much on.</p><p>Some Concord players are saying there’s not enough time to grind to the Platinum trophy, so it might escape them. Others are holding out hope that Concord returns in free-to-play form, although there’s no guarantee it will return at all. As a result, the Concord Platinum trophy may go down as one of the rarest in PlayStation history.</p><p>What’s clear is that Concord itself is one of the biggest flops in PlayStation history, a game one of its developers said was in the works for an incredible eight years. There is now concern for the fate of its developer, Firewalk, and Sony faces tough questions about its upcoming live service games, including Bungie’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> and Haven’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, neither of which have a release date.</p><p>Concord’s launch was nothing short of disastrous, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>analysts telling IGN it has likely sold as few as 25,000 units</u></a>. It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue"><u>was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros.

            <p>
PlayStation's shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">shut down its live-service flop Concord</a> just a fortnight after launch has spurred players who did buy the game to try and reach its max level via an unusual method - before it all disappears.
</p>
<p>
Players are now leaping off cliffs to end matches and earn XP at rapid pace, with a healthy chunk of XP awarded whether a team wins or loses. If Concord was set to last longer, it feels like something developer Firewalk would fix. Now, not so much.
</p>
<p>
Why are Concord owners so concerned with reaching the game's max level of 100? Well, you need to do so to unlock the "Experienced Freegunner" Trophy, and by extension the game's Platinum. Regardless of whether Concord ever returns after Sony pulls the plug and issues refunds, players will have that award - for now, likely one of the rarest Platinum Trophies available - on their profile permanently.

<p>
In a statement released last night, game director Ryan Ellis admitted Concord's "initial launch didn't land" and said the hero shooter would go offline indefinitely from this Friday, 6th September. Owners of the game's digital editions will automatically receive refunds, and have the game removed from their libraries.
</p>
<p>As for what - if anything - is next for Concord, Ellis said Firewalk would take time to "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p> <div>

"But muddled hero designs and unimaginative maps and modes leave it struggling to stand out."

            <p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is not due to "platform limitations".</p>
<p>Game Science's action-RPG was released last month on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was in fact a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/">Forbes</a> the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>

<p>The full statement reads: "As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>A similar statement was previously supplied to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded">Windows Central</a>, in which Microsoft said it "can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p>Both Forbes and IGN reported the delay was due to an exclusivity deal with PlayStation, though this was disputed by other industry insiders.</p>
<p>Game Science and PlayStation have not commented publicly on the speculation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale across only two platforms. Two weeks later, that number will likely have risen considerably - and will of course be boosted further by the forthcoming Xbox release.</p>
<p>However, the Xbox version remains without a release date at present, despite ongoing speculation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The initial reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 console could be happening this month, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Gamesindustry.biz's Christopher Dring revealed earlier today on X that "industry whispers" on the Nintendo console indicate that something related to it is happening this month. While a full reveal is unlikely, there's a good chance that the console will at least be formally announced, possibly with its official name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With industry whispers around ‘something’ Switch 2-related happening this month. I thought I’d remind everyone of the official list of the greatest games consoles of all time.</p>
<p>1. Nintendo Switch<br>
2. Everyone else</p>
<p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1831232577161605130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While we have to take the possible Nintendo Switch 2 reveal this month with a grain of salt, there's a very good chance that something is indeed happening soon, going by precedent, as the original Switch was first revealed in October 2016. How much we will learn in this initial reveal about the system remains to be seen, but one thing seems to be certain: the wait is almost over.</p>
<p>Despite the reveal happening soon, we shouldn't expect the Nintendo Switch 2 release date to be too close. Recent rumors suggest that the console will not be released in the current fiscal year, as developers have been told not to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-miss-early-2025-launch/">expect an early 2025 release</a>. The console's release window is not the only thing that is still up in the air, as virtually nothing is known about the console, though other rumors suggest that it should have decent <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-smooth-1080p-ray-tracing/">ray tracing capabilities and performance.</a></p>

            <p>
When I catch word of a chocolate-and-peanut-butter blend of genres such as "cyberpunk survival horror RPG", my eyes light up. Literally, they light up like the pilot lights of flamethrowers, like glyphs on a cursed monolith that has been exposed to fresh blood after a billion years of dormancy. When I hear that the aforesaid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is set on a "dying space station", I begin to emit a monotonous reverberation, like <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-nasa-strange-noise-heard-astronaut.html">the mysterious banging recently heard aboard the Boeing Starliner</a>. And when I hear that it's being made by the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shadowrun">Shadowrun</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battletech">Battletech</a>, I extend dozens of independently cognitive motorised tentacles and begin writing a news article.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Revealed just today, Harebrained Schemes' Graft isn't just "cyberpunk", it's "post-cyberpunk". Strictly speaking, "post-cyberpunk" probably means the noughties, when the neon promise of cyborgs and endless digital networking finally gave way to the dour mundanity of everybody having a smartphone, a Facebook account and a case of low-key perma-anxiety, but I'll allow it, because I do love me a doomed space station. Here's the trailer.

<p>
Some blurb: "the Arc is dying. You must escape. Once, it hung in the sky like a jeweled moon - a continent-sized station filled with biomechanically enhanced citizens, all working toward some greater purpose lost to time. Bodies were replaceable, resurrection assumed.
</p>
<p>
"Now your city - one of the last - has fallen, swallowed by the encroaching darkness of the station's slow death," it continues. "Beyond its walls you find yourself in the Arc's decaying superstructure, where both power and light are precious resources. But the darkness isn't empty. It only feels that way at first."
</p>
<p>
I am enthused by this scene-setting, and by the promise of roaming "self-replicating labyrinths" and real-time shoot-outs with "feral abominations" and the "ruthless agents of a mad AI". But I'm more enthused about the game's progression or upgrades element, which has uncommon narrative gravitas. Your character can attach or, if you will, "graft" augmentations to their body, but each piece of technology you stitch to your nervous system brings with it the recollections of the previous owner.
</p>
<p>
"With each Graft, strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories flood your system," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">the Steam page explains</a>. "Now you remember the hot breath of a lover you never touched. Now you find yourself suddenly obsessing over cruel and sadistic impulses. Now you remember the monotony of an endless solitary confinement. You must choose what each of these fragments means to you, and you must live with the consequences of each choice."
</p>
<p>
In summary, "you are the Ship of Theseus. Who, or what, will you be when you escape?" Choice of nanoware dictating whether you character ends the game a serial killer or a philanthropist? Yes, I can get on board with this.
</p>
<p>
Harebrained Schemes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">"parted ways" with former parent company Paradox Interactive last October</a>, following lower-than-satisfactory sales of The Lamplighters League. Discussing the decision, Paradox chief operational officer Charlotta Nilsson declared that "a new project or sequel in the same genre was not in line with our portfolio plans". It's rumoured that Harebrained pitched a new Battletech game to Paradox before the split. I wouldn't be surprised if nascent ideas for Graft took shape while the studio were still part of the Crusader Kings publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong was the success story of August in the games industry; that much is certain.&nbsp;<span>The debut title from Chinese developer Game Science&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-sells-a-whopping-10-million-copies-in-just-three-days-surpassing-industry-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 10 million copies in three days and crushed Cyberpunk 2077's record for the highest player concurrency on Steam registered by a single player game.</span>&nbsp;CD PROJEKT's game reached 1.05 million concurrent players at its height, while Black Myth: Wukong, no doubt thanks to the massive Chinese community, has peaked at 2.41 million players, ranking second in the all-time peak concurrency Steam chart only behind PUBG: Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>The game was launched on PC and PlayStation 5, but not Xbox. At Summer Game Fest 2024, when Game Science opened pre-orders, the developer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a delay for the Xbox Series S|X version. Early on, there were whispers of a potential timed console exclusivity deal signed by Sony, although Microsoft did not <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comment</a> on that rumor. However, last week, several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the real reason was a technical one, specifically a memory leak issue.</p>
<p>Forbes was able to get a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/microsoft-confirms-black-myth-wukong-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-comments-on-exclusivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from a Microsoft spokesperson, who denied there were any such issues that they were aware of.</p>
<p><em>As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us.</em></p>
<p>The situation remains confusing, to say the least. Is there a soft exclusivity deal for a set period of time? It's hard to say at this point. However, Black Myth: Wukong still has no release window for Xbox. Meanwhile, a rumor from earlier this week <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hints</a> there could be two DLCs for the game before the inevitable sequel goes into production.</p>

			<p>KONAMI is publishing a new game called Deliver At All Costs. A top-down action title developed by Far Out Games, a small indie studio started a few years ago in Gothenburg, Sweden, by three students, Deliver At All Costs is set in 1959 and sees players step into the shoes of Winston Green, a courier transporting 'unconventional cargo'. Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plow through the city across highly destructible environments, wreaking havoc in a wide variety of vehicles. Take on bizarre deliveries and missions each with its own unique play style and mechanic. From delivering a giant flailing Marlin to the disposal of an atomic bomb teetering on the edge of explosion, always expect the unexpected.</li>
<li>Explore an intricately designed world with large semi-open environments both on foot and in your vehicle. Be careful not to upset the citizens, though - they will respond to your actions in the most unpredictable ways…</li>
<li>Amidst the chaos and destruction, embark on a story of mystery and intrigue divided into three acts, with a cast of distinct and memorable characters. Witness Winston’s journey as he spirals downward into the depths of insanity.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the 1950s with aesthetics and evocative music paying homage to the classic era. Featuring 1950s design elements, an original soundtrack, radio ads, English voice acting and a UI fitting of the times - all capturing the essence of what made the 1950s iconic.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Developer Supermassive Games once dared us to survive until dawn, now the interactive slasher movie specialist wants us to be dead by daylight in The Casting of Frank Stone. This story-based spin-off of the popular asymmetric multiplayer sneak-and-slash ‘em up attempts to flesh out a backstory for the malevolent source of all evil in the Dead by Daylight universe, known as The Entity. However, aging, quicktime event-heavy gameplay, dismally superficial combat, an underdeveloped cast of characters, and a complete absence of scares make for a six-hour slog that’s barely worth staying up past your bedtime for.   </p><p>While Dead by Daylight’s character roster has swelled to include a who’s who of nightmare-haunting horror icons like Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and even walking internet memes like Nicholas Cage, The Casting of Frank Stone features an entirely original cast of villains and potential victims. This is very much to its detriment, since barely any of them leave much in the way of a lasting impression. Main monster Frank Stone (Miles Ley) certainly strikes an imposing figure in the story’s prologue, but he’s nowhere to be found for significant stretches after that. Instead, we’re saddled with a truly unremarkable cast in a tepid tale that pinballs back and forth between the filming of a low budget horror movie in an abandoned Cedar Rapids steel mill in 1980, and a clandestine meeting of strangers in an isolated English manor in the present day. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Casting of Frank Stone Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>In both time periods, the plot takes a surprisingly long time to travel short distances, with only small amounts of horror and very little stress to be found amidst meandering conversations between the playable cast of eight characters. With the exception of the likeable Linda (Lucy Griffiths), whose dry sarcasm provides some welcome laughs on occasion and who is thankfully present in both eras, the rest of the leads are saddled with dialogue that’s often clunkier than a piano solo from Freddie Krueger, and forced into relationship contrivances that aren’t given enough time to evolve. In particular, the love triangle between teenagers Jaime (Andrew Wheildon-Dennis), Chris (Rebecca LaChance), and Robert (Idris Debrand) feels rushed and leaves little space for any believable tension to develop between them, which meant that I never really agonised over steering any particular character into the arms of another with my choices.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man.</p></div><p>In fact, so little did I invest in the fates of these partially-formed players that I barely batted an eyelid while each leading man was turned into a bleeding man as the bodycount built up in the story’s second half. It’s here that the Entity’s cosmic power is properly unleashed in both the present and the past, and although there were admittedly some interesting revelations to be uncovered about this malevolent creature and how its evil is pulling Frank Stone’s strings, it all gets pockmarked by a muddled mix of confusing multiversal wormholes and glaring plot holes. All told, this sloppy and scare-less horror story feels less like a mandatory bit of backstory for fans and more like one long, unnecessary and unskippable cutscene to lead into any given Dead by Daylight multiplayer match.   </p><h2>Bad Manors</h2><p>While it may be messy and not the slightest bit memorable, The Casting of Frank Stone’s story certainly has a lot of branching paths, and so too does its environments. Unfortunately, while the dingy, subterranean tunnels beneath the Cedar Rapids steel mill and the gloomy, gilded hallways of Gerant Manor certainly ooze plenty of atmosphere, they just aren’t all that interesting or intimidating to explore. What’s worse, they’re reused far too much – over and over again I found myself plodding past the same bits of scenery like I was a member of Spinal Tap desperately searching for the stage entrance. I spent the vast majority of my time tapping through basic button prompts in cutscenes, so it felt especially limiting that when I was occasionally given full control of a character I was so rarely given anything interesting to see or do. </p><p>There are some simple survival horror puzzles to complete like pushing crates or finding keys and, in one of a number of nods to the core Dead by Daylight experience, you do get faced with the occasional generator in need of repair in order to power up a lift or door. However, whereas the process of fixing these straightforward mechanisms in Dead by Daylight is transformed into fits of heart-pounding panic since you’ve got a murderous Michael Myers from Halloween homing in on your position, here the absence of any stalking threat means they’re robbed of any real urgency and are instead just more basic quicktime events to be obediently ticked off. It’s neat that they’ve incorporated the Dead by Daylight skill check prompt here, but it does little to enhance the actual interactions in any meaningful way.</p><p>While I never struggled to repair its generators, I wish someone had taken the time to fix The Casting of Frank Stone’s inability to generate scares. Outside of life or death cutscene-based decisions, the rare enemy encounters are otherwise trivialised by a powerful weaponised camera that transforms from Super 8 to supernatural. There’s only ever one Entity-powered Frank Stone specter to face off against at a time, and all you need to do is train the camera’s viewfinder on them and hit record to sap them of all their life force. Their presence is always clearly signposted, and as a result they never got the drop on me nor did they ever get remotely close enough to pose any form of threat – I’m not sure if they’re even able to perform any attacks since they effectively stayed at a comfortable wide shot in my viewfinder; never a killer close-up. Dead by Daylight might be capable of some truly terrifying stalker escapes, but The Casting of Frank Stone is about as stressful as a spa bath in comparison.  </p><h2>Dead by Design</h2><p>Of course, since this is a Supermassive Games adventure, some of the characters can and likely will die. But in my experience of The Casting of Frank Stone, this was either because I was perfectly happy to let them go, or because I was having a sip of coffee and was too slow to reach for my controller during an unexpected and evidently majorly consequential cutscene junction. Roughly half of the cast of playable characters perished before I rolled credits, and although I was pleased to see that some of those executions were ripped straight out of Dead by Daylight – such as the piercing of a certain victim onto the sharp end of a dangling hook – I can’t say that any of these unmemorable meatsacks met their sudden deaths in any particularly inspired or shocking ways. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Once the campaign is completed, you unlock a Cutting Room Floor feature that allows you to trace each branching story path backwards and hop back into specific scenes, allowing you to pick up a story thread and twist it in a new direction by making a different decision and seeing how things play out. It’s a nice feature if you want to experience all possible outcomes, however I wish it was a little more flexible – in order to prevent one character death I was forced to replay six scenes in the lead up to the moment that decided their fate, rather than just hopping directly to that critical decision and going from there, which seemed annoyingly cumbersome. </p><p>Still, this branching chapter select is certainly handy if you want to go back and find any Dead by Daylight-inspired collectibles, with signature killers like The Trapper and The Clown shrunken down into adorable, Chuckie-sized plushies and hidden throughout each setting. This is in addition to numerous other nods to the multiplayer murder sim, like The Huntress’ rabbit mask I found on a shelf in Cedar Rapids’ curiosity shop. Dead by Daylight diehards will likely get a kick out of discovering all of these, but whether they make it worth playing (let alone replaying) a pretty forgettable horror story depends on how fiercely loyal your fandom may be. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tristan's Favourite Horror Games</h3><p>Intensity in ten entries.</p></div></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Casting of Frank Stone’s repetitive, time-hopping horror tale is packed with dozens of character choices to consider, but really the most important decision that Dead by Daylight fans need to make is whether or not a sub-standard, six-hour story is worth sitting through purely to spot the odd recognisable weapon or slight reference to the source material’s lore. I would argue it’s not, since no single stretch of this sluggish and forgettable horror show ever comes close to matching the frantic amounts of fun to be had in a single, 15-minute Dead by Daylight trial. Unable to match the intensity of its murderous multiplayer inspiration and lagging well behind Until Dawn and The Quarry as a standalone story, The Casting of Frank Stone is a second-rate interactive slasher that just can’t hack it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has a 2.6-inch screen has 160 x 144p resolution--the same specs as the Game Boy Color. But no need to feel bad for your eyes, as you will actually be able to see what's happening in your game without needing perfect lighting conditions or an accessory that unevenly illuminates your Game Boy. The Chromatic has a backlit IPS screen made of scratch-resistant, anti-glare glass.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Analogue Pocket has a 3.5-inch glass display with 1600 x 1440p resolution and 615 pixels per inch. It makes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review-the-best-way-to-play-game-boy-games/1100-6498917/" data-ref-id="1100-6498917">Game Boy, GBC, and GBA games look absolutely stunning</a> with Analogue's custom pixel perfect filter. You can change the filter to mimic specific Game Boy models, from the chunky DMG to GBC to the backlit GBA SP and more.</p><p>The Chromatic is strictly for Game Boy and GBC games, whereas the Pocket supports GB, GBC, <em>and</em> GBA out of the box, and adapters are sold separately for Game Gear, Atari Lynx, TurboGrafx-16, and Neo Geo Pocket Color carts. FPGA cores can be added via microSD, so you can play other platforms as well with a bit of tinkering. As a result of wider platform support, the Pocket has four face buttons and two triggers, whereas the Chromatic can get by with two face buttons and a D-pad.</p><p>Though we haven't had a chance to try the Chromatic, the build materials for the shell and buttons sound promising. Its buttons are made of PBT, a durable thermoplastic used for keycaps on high-end mechanical keyboards. The shell is made of magnesium alloy and shaped just like the original DMG Game Boy. Even the start and select buttons mirror the diagonal design of the Game Boy. ModRetro claims the case is "virtually indestructible," which could inspire some creative drop tests.</p><p>One pretty darn cool thing about the Chromatic is its battery versatility. It comes with three AA batteries and runs for 24 hours before you need to replace them. Rechargeable AA batteries are supported, too, and you can charge them via USB-C. If you don't want to deal with regular batteries of any kind, you'll also find a rechargeable lithium ion battery pack in the box.</p><p>Other notable features include video out for capturing gameplay on your PC, a link cable port for multiplayer, 3.5mm audio jack, and an IR sensor, which is used for select multiplayer features like receiving Mystery Gifts in Pokemon Gold and Silver. All multiplayer features are backwards compatible with original hardware.</p><p><strong>ModRetro Chromatic specifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Price</strong> - $199 for first edition bundle with Tetris cart</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong> - Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Chromatic cartridges</li><li><strong>Display</strong> - Backlit 2.56-inch IPS LCD (sapphire crystal glass)</li><li><strong>Resolution</strong> - 160 x 144p</li><li><strong>Size</strong> - 5.2 x 3 x 1.2-inch, 6.2oz</li><li><strong>Shell</strong> - Magnesium alloy thixomolded shell</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong> - PBT face buttons and D-pad</li><li><strong>Battery</strong> - 24 hours with 3 AA batteries, lithium ion rechargeable battery pack</li><li><strong>Audio</strong> - internal speaker, 3.5mm headphones</li><li><strong>Ports</strong> - link cable, 3.5mm audio, USB-C with video out</li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong> - via backwards compatible link cable, IR sensor</li><li><strong>Colors</strong> - Gray (GameStop exclusive) | Six other colors available at ModRetro</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you don't have a Game Boy library, more <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" rel="nofollow ">Chromatic carts are available to purchase separately</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2-campaign-length-explained.971382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-length/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While a single-player campaign certainly isn’t the focal point for a horde shooter, especially when it includes PvE and PvP game modes, it’s nice knowing you’ll get your money’s worth on all fronts. That said, here’s what we know about the Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 campaign length!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-single-player-campaign-in-space-marine-2">How Long is the Single-Player Campaign in Space Marine 2?</h2>



<p>You certainly shouldn’t expect a massive campaign of epic proportions, but it’s a comfortable size for a weekend romp. It takes approximately<strong> 8-10 hours to finish the campaign</strong> in Space Marine 2 on standard difficulty settings. If you lower the difficulty, it may take less time. If you increase the difficulty, expect up to 12 or so hours to finish the story mode.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as you can play through the campaign cooperatively, having a human partner by your side instead of the AI should help you finish the main missions a little quicker.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-pve-missions-does-space-marine-2-include">How Many PvE Missions Does Space Marine 2 Include?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can expect approximately five to six PvE missions on launch, with more to come in the future, as per the studio’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year one roadmap</a>. Like in World War Z, PvE missions will likely be highly replayable in Space Marine 2. As you’ll want to unlock much of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-customization-details-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s cosmetics</a>, including weapons and armor skins, you’ll likely play through each mission repeatedly to score points or currency necessary to unlock equipment. That’s how things worked in World War Z.</p>



<p>Of course, alongside the campaign and PvE missions, there’s also the PvP game mode, which will extend the lifespan of the third-person action game for many. If PvP isn’t your thing, there’s nothing wrong with moving on to another game while waiting for more PvE missions to release!</p>
