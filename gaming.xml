		<p>Team, Jade, the developers of Delta Force and Call of Duty mobile, have revealed their next game, which is currently languishing under the name of Project Spectrum.</p>
<p>It’s a team based PvEvP shooter with a strong horror element. The trailer is suitably spooky and weird and seems to show that you will be able to play as a black tentacle monster as well as human combatants.&nbsp; Sadly that’s about all I can tell you at the moment, no other details were revealed.</p>

		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that the co-op Legends mode will be coming to Ghost of Yotei in 2026. If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participating in Raids, and playing as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format, and may use a mix of elements from the story including the Yotei Six.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A new story trailer has also been released which gives us more of a look at Atsu and her quest for vengeance as well as the world in which players will travel. We see wide open fields which capture a similar feel to the fields that were in Ghost of Tsushima. There are some cinematics too which show confrontations with some of the Yotei Six too.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> now has a firm release date confirmed, with the long-in-development action RPG set to launch on 21st October 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer from Gamescom Opening Night Live:</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrAVDT7maJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will come with a $59.99/£49.99/€59.99 price point for the standard edition, while a Deluxe and Premium edition bumps that up to $69.99/£58.50/€69.99 and $89.99/£74.99/€89.99 respectively. What bonuses do you get? Well, the Deluxe Edition adds a Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack inspired by the original game, while the Premium Edition then also adds the Shadows and Silk DLC, which bring the Lasombra and Toreador clans into the game as playable vampire types.</p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has had a very, very long journey through development. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game. Still set in Seattle, there’s a three-way power struggle for power in the Vampire Court, and in an intriguing shift, with protagonist Phyre cast as an Elder Vampire, capable of tapping into all the fantastical enhancements that each clan offers them. First expected for late 2024, release has slipped multiple times, though the most recent delay to October 2025 has finally stuck. Hurrah!</p>
<p>We’ve actually been hands on with the opening couple hours of the game in the run up to Gamescom, and there’s an intriguing blend of characters, dire situations and powerful vampire types. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/fangs-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-opening-hours-and-the-lasombra-clan/">Check out our preview here</a>.</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/age-of-empires-iv">Age of Empire IV</a> has been officially announced for PS5 during <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> 2025. This is the first time the legendary strategy series has appeared on a PlayStation console for over 20 years, AoE4 offering intuitive gamepad controls and plenty of bonus content via the game’s numerous expansions.</p>

<p>Speaking of expansions, Microsoft and Relic Entertainment have also announced the next major DLC for its strategy sequel dubbed Dynasty of the East. Unsurprisingly, this upcoming pack looks to feature several new factions based on historical cultures from Southeast Asia, adding to the game’s vast roster of units and playable scenarios.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 gamers won’t have to wait too long to get their hands on the RTS. Age of Empire IV: Anniversary Edition will officially launch for PS5 on November 4, 2025, with a 5-day early access period available for those who pre-order the premium edition.</p>

<p>Cats, monsters, and... James Sunderland?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bloober Team has unveiled its latest trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on Switch, and it's probably the best one yet.</p>
<p>Starting from the perspective of a cat, of all things, it quickly descends into chaos, with monsters roaming about, weird telekinetic abilities, and even some nifty anti-grav sections.</p>
<p>In what we're certain is just an amusing coincidence, there's also a very short clip at about 1:41 in which we see a character that looks remarkably similar to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s protagonist, James Sunderland. Notably, Bloober Team created the recent remake exclusively for PS5, which launched to critical acclaim. The dude in the trailer is looking a bit worse for wear though, so whatever's happened to him can't be good.</p>
<p>It's looking promising, regardless, and we're excited to see more. Cronos: The New Dawn will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, publishers Paradox Interactive and White Wolf and developer The Chinese Room announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be released on October 21 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The news will certainly come as a relief to long-time fans, after all the issues with Hardsuit Labs and the subsequent <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switch to The Chinese Room</a>.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are now open, with customers able to choose from three editions: the basic one, the Deluxe One, and the Premium one. The latter is particularly interesting because it includes access to two clans for the main character, Lasombra and Toreador, who are otherwise locked during character creation. This decision may well prove controversial among fans.</p>



<p>Here's the full lowdown:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Deluxe Edition includes Santa Monica Memories, a cosmetic pack featuring decor items inspired by the original cult classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines to adorn Phyre’s in-game apartment. Santa Monica Memories can also be purchased separately for $11.99 USD.</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Premium Edition includes both the Santa Monica Memories and Shadows and Silk DLC. The latter, as mentioned above, enables players to choose the Lasombra or Toreador clans for Phyre. Each clan offers unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits. Shadows and Silk can also be purchased separately for $21.99 USD.</li>
</ul>



<p>Those who pre-order any Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 edition will receive the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox, an in-game decor item featuring original music by iconic Bloodlines 1 composer Rik Schaffer.</p>

<p>Wccftech was provided access to the very opening missions of the game ahead of Gamescom 2025. You can read our hands-on here; we'll also be able to play a later mission while at Gamescom this week, and we have an interview scheduled as well, so stay tuned for those reports, too.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/silent-hill-f-everything-we-know-brand-new-chapter-konami-horror/">Silent Hill f</a> was another one of the games we knew we'd get a new look at during <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-resident-evil-ghost-of-yotei-fallout-tv-ninja-gaiden-4/">Gamescom ONL 2025</a>, and just like every showing of the game so far, Silent Hill f continues to look more terrifying than the last time we saw it.</p>



<p>The new trailer shows off more of the gameplay and combat that players will experience when the game launches this coming September, and delves more into the horrifying story and mystery that players will navigate in Silent Hill f.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SILENT HILL f | Story Trailer (4K: EN/ESRB) English VO | KONAMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJ_FQSaptiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Silent Hill f puts you in the shoes of Hinako Shimizu, who has to figure out what happened to her town when a thick fog covers every inch of it, and monsters begin to roam the streets. It's both the most exciting and mysterious of the Silent Hill games Konami has lined up in its portfolio. </p>



<p>There's a lot we've heard about how this new adventure in the Silent Hill series came together, about how it's core design concept is to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-silent-hill-f-deep-dive-digs-into-how-konamis-core-design-concept-of-find-the-beauty-in-terror-drove-the-games-development/">"<em>find the beauty in horror</em>"</a> and why the team wanted to bring the series out of the United States and into Japan, but there's still plenty that's unclear about Hinako Shimizu's story, and what exactly is plaguing her and her town.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we don't have to wait too much longer to find out, as the game is due to release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, this coming September 25, 2025. For more Silent Hill after this game's release next month, fans of the series have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake of the original game from Bloober Team to look forward to</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The immersive entertainment company Meow Wolf has announced their next interactive experience, and it is a TTRPG. The company is working alongside Genuine Entertainment and Exalted Funeral for the aptly named <em>Tavers: The Meow Wolf RPG</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Tavers: The Meow Wolf RPG</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Tavers: The Meow Wolf RPG</em> will be coming to Kickstarter in Spring 2026. In this RPG, players are the titular tavers, people with the power to open portals to new worlds, alternate realities, and new states of existence. Those worlds will include immortal cybernetic hamsters, sentient pizza, and underground rat punks, and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/meow-wolf-exhibit-promo-image.jpg?itok=qn9B31UB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/meow-wolf-exhibit-promo-image.jpg?itok=LyeV55T6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game will emphasize creativity and imagination, utilizing an "exquisite corpse" approach to shared storytelling with a focus on mystery and the unknown.</p>

<p>Notably, the press release does not specify a certain RPG system or a central gameplay mechanic. It states that the game will "empower players to do far more than just skill checks;&nbsp;daring to manifest impossible ideas that defy logic, shift perception, and reshape<br>
reality itself."</p>

<p>As for the unusual worlds in <em>Tavers: The Meow Wolf RPG</em>, some may be familiar to fans of the studio's past work. Players are encouraged to shape the story and the worlds they enter through their choices and actions. Memories formed by both players and their characters can be used as currency.</p>

<p>Meow Wolf is one of the most popular immersive art companies in recent years. Their first exhibit, <em>House of Eternal Return</em>, debuted in Santa Fe in 2016. Since then, they have helmed other mind-bending exhibits, such as 2021's <em>Omega Mart</em> in Las Vegas and <em>Convergence Station</em> in Denver. Their most recent project was 2024's <em>Radio Tave</em>, a community radio station that spanned multiple dimensions.</p>

<p>Meow Wolf's partners in this project come from similar unconventional places. Exalted Funeral's body of work includes the quirky <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monty-python-ttrpg-is-coming-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monty Python TTRPG</em></a>, and Genuine Entertainment has had experience with TTRPG adaptations of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diablo-board-game-unleashes-hell-in-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Diablo</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-ttrpg-shambles-to-tables-fall-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Walking Dead</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 11 bit studios and developer Digital Sun have announced that&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will be coming to Early Access before it gets a full release, and the two studios have also revealed the release date for that launch.</p>

<p>As announced during today's Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>&nbsp;will be hitting Early Access on PC on October 23rd. Evidently, this means the console releases will come later.</p>

<p>The two studios say that crafting&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>into its "final form" will take time, and that while the game is "nearly complete", there are still "a few parts" of the experience that "need polishing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-early-access-training-dummy.jpg?itok=Y3sv6Rvi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-early-access-training-dummy.jpg?itok=bkePgZD3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Much like Will here,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>needs to train a little before it's ready for the real thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>is launching into Early Access, it doesn't sound like you're getting a significantly cut-back version of the game; 11 bit and Digital Sun promise "most of the story" will be available at launch.</p>

<p>You'll be able to explore three biomes, gather and sell over 120 relics and items, and explore a combat system with four main weapons, "nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks", and a smoother feel.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>is, it's the sequel to 2018's shop management sim-slash-roguelite dungeon crawler&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em>. Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">back in December</a>, the game switches its predecessor's pixel art look for a 3D visual style.</p>

<p>Other than that change, though, it sounds as though&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will largely be business as usual if you've played the first game; 11 bit and Digital Sun say you can expect "a quest demanding plenty of dodge rolling, fighting, looting, and clever shopkeeping".</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> (as well as on PC Game Pass) on October 23rd.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>There’s an extremely <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hasandpiker/video/7130294631920602410?lang=en">funny clip of political commentator Hasan Piker</a> watching a video in which the guy narrating makes a joke about following Piker for reasons other than “his political views.” Piker pauses the video and goes to check and finds out that the creator does, in fact, subscribe to his Twitch channel, and then after he’s done, he unpauses the video and the narration continues with “thanks for unpausing the video, Hasan.” Piker, knowing he’s been read to filth, screams into his mic because this embarrassing moment has been caught on camera for millions to see. This is basically what just happened to me at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, in which Obsidian released a new trailer for <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> focusing on the RPG’s companions. Knowing that the original game didn’t include romantic relationships, I dropped a message in the&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>slack asking if I would be able to kiss a space man this time around, only for the trailer to say “and no, you can’t sleep with them” seconds later. Well fuck you, too, Mr. Announcer Guy.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Companions Trailer - Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h8nVW5UGIcg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>I don’t know shit about fuck regarding this merry band of misfits, but I did see Tristan in all his rugged, bearded glory swinging around a giant hammer and my brain turned off. I can’t so much as give him a light peck on the cheek, but I guess we don’t all get what we want in this life, do we Obsidian? Why would you put this man in front of me if I can’t take a bite? Why show me something if I can’t have it? Isn’t this how <em>Uncut Gems&nbsp;</em>started? Just waving desirable things in front of people willing to pay money for them, only for it all to ultimately end in chaos and destruction?</p> <p>Anyway, <em>The O</em><em>uter Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 29, and I only accidentally typed&nbsp;<em>Outer Wilds 2</em> once while writing this blog.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>The Darkest Files</em> is a game about investigating Nazis long after WWII has ended in order to deliver justice for their victims. And in an unusual moment that punctuated the evening’s typical industry hype, its director, Jörg Friedrich, appeared on stage at Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live showcase to highlight why games like his are important.</p> <p>“[The Darkest Files] shows we cannot simply stand by and watch, we must take action,” Friedrich said. “Games are more than entertainment; like any great form of art they reflect our concerns, our fears, our hopes, and what preoccupies us. Democracy is under attack right now. Minority rights are being violated.”</p> <p>He continued, “The world is becoming increasingly interconnected. So games are a powerful medium for addressing these issues and they have the potential to inspire change. I am glad that not only are many people in the video game industry engaging in projects like this but also more and more institutions like the European Commission or the United Nations.”</p> <p>Friedrich’s appearance, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2058730/The_Darkest_Files/"><em>The Darkest Files</em></a> being highlighted at the showcase,&nbsp; are part of the event’s Gamescom Cares initiative, which includes trying to give a platform to “responsibility projects.” Others included <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244700/Glasshouse/">Glasshouse</a></em>, a “feudalpunk” CRPG about people trapped in a house during a world war by developer FLAT28, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795590/Compensation_Not_Guaranteed/"><em>Compensation Not Guaranteed</em></a>, a sort of <em>Papers,</em>–<em>Please</em>-meets<em>-Animal</em>–<em>Crossing</em> point-and-click sim about reviewing land documents in a post-colonial country where the government is taking people’s land for urban development.</p> <div role="heading" aria-level="2" data-hveid="CB8QAA" data-ved="2ahUKEwjq1pDxypePAxVyrokEHf8WK5sQtwcoAHoECB8QAA" lang="en-US" data-md="25"> <div data-tts="answers" data-tts-text="Jörg Friedrich"> <p>While Friedrich didn’t say exactly who democracy is under attack from, the comments come amid the backdrop of right-wing authoritarian shifts in several governments across the globe, including President Trump’s recent deployment of military forces on the streets of the U.S. capital. There’s Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and an increasingly dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza amid <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/15/world/middleeast/gaza-children-school-play.html">ongoing reports</a> of the Israeli military shooting civilians and blocking aid.</p>  </div> <p>The brief Gamescom segment was the most overtly political that host Geoff Keighley has ever let one of his showcases get, even if it stopped short of any direct calls to action. While<em> Glasshouse</em> and<em> Compensation Not Guaranteed</em> haven’t been released yet, <em>The Darkest Files</em> released earlier this year on Steam to positive reviews.</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei made a special appearance at Gamescom Opening Night Live with a brand new trailer. The sequel to 2020’s acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima, the game spearheads PlayStation’s first-party titles for 2025, releasing on October 2nd, 2025. If the trailer is anything to go by, it’ll be one for the history books. </p>



<p>Taking place over 300 years after Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei lets you play as Atsu, a vengeful mercenary, on a quest to kill the Yotei Six. With a variety of weapons at your disposal, you can charge or sneak into battle in a vast open world. We last saw the title in its own State of Play, but now, we get a bit more info thanks to Geoff Keighley and Gamescom.</p>



<h2 id="h-atsu-gets-her-revenge-in-new-ghost-of-yotei-trailer">Atsu Gets Her Revenge in New Ghost of Yotei Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yotei Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOLzd6Mj5qg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the new trailer for Ghost of Yotei, seen above, we see Atsu confront the Yotei Six, who killed her family and scarred her. On her quest to get redemption, she’ll travel Yotei and take those on who hurt her. As a stinger in the trailer, it was revealed that the free multiplayer Legends will come in 2026.</p>



<p>The game, while not having Tsushima’s Jin Sakai as the protagonist, will take a lot from it. Aside from the free roam and stealth/action combat, players will be able to approach situations however they want. This time, you’ll have new weapons like the chain-blade kusarigama and the spear-like yari.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima, despite releasing in a packed 2020, was one of the year’s finest. The game won multiple accolades from various outlets and numerous Game of the Year nominations, including at <a href="https://thegameawards.com/rewind/year-2020">The Game Awards</a>. All that said, fans have high hopes that Ghost of Yotei will live up to Tsushima’s legacy.</p>



<p id="block-892b34ed-16c7-4b69-ad21-6c3142ed71da">Are you excited to play Ghost of Yotei when it comes out in October? Did you play Ghost of Tsushima? Let us know in the comments or on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">the Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

As she wanders, it seems she's in some kind of shrine, and ends up following a figure with a blue lamp deeper in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 is finally a reality after an announcement at Opening Night Live 2025. We have a debut trailer, snippets of gameplay, a new faction making its series debut, and a surprise developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The much-loved real-time strategy series began life in 2004 with Relic Entertainment’s Dawn of War, and the expectation was that if a fourth game was ever going to be made, it would be Relic who would do it. Indeed, Relic was behind the recently released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">Dawn of War Definitive Edition</a>, which breathed new life into the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Dawn of War 4 is in development at King Art Games, the studio behind alternate reality 1920s RTS <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/iron-harvest">Iron Harvest</a>, and is published by Deep Silver (Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Dead Island 2), with help from a German video game grant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s in Dawn of War 4? It’s billed as returning the RTS series to its roots, which is sure to please fans of the first game. Expect “deeply satisfying gameplay” and a “brutal, expanded Sync Kill system.” One of the best things about the Dawn of War games are the Sync Kills, which see cool animations play out when certain units kill an enemy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are four factions at launch: Space Marines; Orks; Necrons; and making their Dawn of War debut, the Adeptus Mechanicus. There are four story campaigns with over 70 missions in total (we’re told there are “spectacular” CGI intros and fully animated cutscenes). You can play the campaign solo or with a friend, with a story penned by Black Library author John French (the Ahriman series).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines returns, as do some of the characters from the previous games, such as Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz. The story itself is set “many years” after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, the second expansion for the first Dawn of War. There’s no mention of Dawn of War 2 or the disastrous Dawn of War 3 in today's announcement. Clearly, the hope here is Dawn of War 4 will lean on the enduring love for the more traditional RTS original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are Last Stand and Skirmish modes with over 30 missions, and the expected multiplayer with over 30 maps. There are over 10 playable Commanders, over 110 units / buildings, many of which are customisable, an in-game editor, and a painter tool for unit customization.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The series returns to its roots with classic Dawn of War gameplay and a combat system designed to bring Warhammer 40,000’s bloodthirsty combat to life like never before. Grow your force, build your base of operations, specialise your squads, and savour an expanded Sync Kill system that delivers an unprecedented degree of melee combat detail.</blockquote><blockquote>Enjoy an endlessly replayable collection of game modes, including the return of fan-favourite Last Stand! Fight highly-configurable AI battles in Skirmish, or take on the world in 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer. Wherever you’re waging war, use the Painter tool to stamp your own unique personality on your fighting forces, as well as the option to use existing factions from the Warhammer 40,000 universe.</blockquote><blockquote>Set many years after the events of Dawn of War: Dark Crusade, war has returned to the planet Kronus, along with Captain Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Warboss Gorgutz and several new commanders as four factions fight for supremacy. Kronus features a number of distinct biomes including the Wasteland, Iceland, Highlands, Hive City &amp; Manufactorum regions. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War 4 is due out at some point in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has been announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live, featuring an open-world version of Gotham you can drive around in the Batmobile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ambitious-looking project is being developed by TT Games, the studio behind Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga and numerous other licensed Lego games, and is set to launch on Nintendo Switch 2, PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Included in the game are characters and levels that pay reference to various familiar Batman movies and comics, while combat looks similar to the Batman Arkham games. Oh, and Matt Berry is playing Bane.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Whether he’s the wrathful Dark Knight, the brilliant detective, or the unlikely father of the ‘Batfam,’ Batman has constantly evolved — shaped by the world around him while remaining a timeless symbol," said Jim Lee, President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer, DC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game brings together nearly every facet of his legacy, letting you experience the full range of what makes Batman iconic. Built with incredible care, creativity, and deep respect for the mythos,<strong> </strong>TT Games has crafted a love letter to the world of Batman.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight's story begins with a young Bruce Wayne training a fresh League of Shadows, recruiting allies such as Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, Catwoman, and Talia al Ghul. The famous names don't stop there, of course, as the team will be facing down enemies such as The Joker, The Penguin, Poison Ivy, Ra's al Ghul, and, as previously mentioned, Bane. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">TT Games once held a near monopoly over licensed Lego video games for PC and consoles, with new titles released on an annual basis. Between 2005 and 2022, the company launched at least 20 Lego games, with multiple entries based on Marvel, DC, Harry Potter and Star Wars franchises. The company dabbled with the toys-to-life genre with its earlier multiverse project Lego Dimensions, and sandbox gameplay in Lego Worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, TT Games' new take on Lego Batman arrives during a different era, with a range of Lego games available from other developers, the toy franchise deeply integrated into Fortnite, and a lengthy (for Lego games) wait since 2022's Lego Skywalker: The Skywalker Saga. It'll be fascinating to see more of what the developer has been building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I don't know what to do with all these clown noses anymore.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, hello, we're back again with another update on the ongoing saga of "Are we getting a Silksong release date this week?" The answer is, still maybe, but it's not happening at Gamescom Opening Night Live today. Instead, we got almost 30 whole seconds of brand new gameplay, and a reassurance that it is, in fact, coming out this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I sound a little over it, it's because I, like many of you, put on my clown makeup yesterday at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">behest of ONL host Geoff Keighley</a>, when he teased something Silksong related at his show today. There was no guarantee of what it was going to be, if anything. But there's a whole heap of evidence pointing toward the release date being soon, like in the next few months, and given that we still don't know it, ONL would have been perfect for an announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, today, hours before the show, developer Team Cherry <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-teases-special-announcement-later-this-week">teased a "special announcement"</a> for Silksong this Thursday, while Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier took to social media to affirm no release date for Silksong would be revealed at Opening Night Live. Okay, fine. And <em>then, </em>during the pre-show, this happened:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/gamescom-onl-2025-official-livestream-call-of-duty-resident-evil-fallout-live-now-44-17-screenshot-1755627199032.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So, okay, no Silksong at all during ONL? Fine, sure. But then, there it was! For 30 whole seconds, and a confirmation from Keighley that it would be out later this year and on the Gamescom show floor, both of which we already knew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community, of course, has been completely normal about all this, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">as usual</a>, with the subreddit and "silksong" tags on various other social platforms absolutely exploding throughout. It looks like everyone's coming out of this happy: they got new footage today, and a likely release date coming on Thursday, though at this point I'm hesitant to posit even that much given the back-and-forth nature of this whole situation. It's become such a meme at this point that it's almost impossible to tell what's going on with this game anymore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the footage itself is kind of cool, if a bit thin on actually revealing meaty new information. We see what looks like a new boss in there, and some of Hornet using some cool abilities on various enemies. I'm sure in the coming hours the community will fully dissect and compare this with older footage (the last new stuff we saw was back in 2023) to see what all we can glean from it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully Thursday is finally a release date so we can end this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">weird, six-year anticipation</a> once and for all and just get on with playing the dang thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

That was a really unique challenge, but also fun to be able to know that you're going to do that.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent months, there has been more than one suggestion from members of the games industry that Call of Duty games are “lazy," and that the threat of EA's rival shooter, Battlefield 6, will force a change in approach from Activision. In a recent interview with IGN, we put both of those suggestions to Black Ops 7 co-developer Treyarch to get its response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s words follow a series of claims from industry peers that the annualised shooter series is in need of some healthy competition. At this year’s Summer Game Fest, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">Splitgate 2 director Ian Proulx stated that he was “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year."</a> That sentiment is seemingly shared by former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, who posted last week in relation to the latest Battlefield 6 open beta:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield will boot stomp CoD this year. But the real win here is CoD won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1953621587993014620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN ahead of Black Ops 7's Opening Night Live 2025 reveal, associate creative director Miles Leslie said Treyarch tries to shut out the noise and focus on delivering the best game possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You just don't worry about it, right?” Leslie said when asked about the "lazy" claims. “When we start, it’s not like ‘what are they going to think?’ It’s like, we have a vision, we’re going to hit that vision, and there’s always going to be people that are going to try to knock you down and not have positive criticism, which we do look for. So, it’s like noise, right? You try to cut through that and stick to your vision and plan.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And from what I’ve seen, it really would be unfair to call this year’s Call of Duty lazy. You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-isnt-lazy-its-the-series-biggest-swing-in-years"><u>read all about it in my full Black Ops 7 preview here</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the threat of Battlefield 6, we asked Leslie if DICE's game pushes Treyarch on or even if the developer thinks about the game at all. Leslie said he'd played DICE's game but is focused squarely on Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I got to play this weekend," he said. "It's a fun game. We're fans of all games and I think we look for inspiration anywhere. But we're focused on our own craft. They're doing their thing. We know if we can hit our goals, we're going to deliver what the fans want and that's the key, because if we're happy when we're play testing, then we know fans are going to be happy play testing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're fans of the FPS genre.

I've had the pleasure of working on Call of Duty now for almost 20 years, and we're constantly looking at ways to push into different audiences and fans, and that's what you saw with that; there are fans that really love it. Obviously, there are fans who those may not be their favorite. We're going to try to calibrate that as we move forward, and we take that feedback seriously. But again, we are trying to make sure that all fans feel represented in the game and figuring out that tight balance is something we're paying attention to.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It comes as Battlefield 6 — a far more self-serious depiction of warfare — emerges as a genuine contender to Call of Duty’s online shooter dominance. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Don’t expect to see similar outrageous outfits making their way into EA’s military sim</u></a>, though, with design director Shashank Uchil stating, “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlestar Galactica has become one of the lost classics in the modern sci-fi canon. We live in an era of constant reinterpolation—new Star Wars serials churn from Disney every quarter, and Star Trek is consistently made flush with new content—but if you weren't watching television in the mid-2000s, there's a good chance you completely missed this heady tale of survival and humanity that once dominated the discourse. And in that sense, Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is the first breath of new life into the franchise in more than a decade. The game doesn't attempt to be the long-awaited expansion of the continuity, but from what I've played so far, it does make a valiant effort to replicate why people fell in love with this universe in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scattered Hopes is, basically, a turn-based roguelike, set in a galaxy that is especially apt for the genre. If you're unfamiliar with Battlestar Galactica, the story follows the last remnants of humanity that have had their galaxy-spanning empire wiped out by a superpowered fleet of sentient robots known as the Cylons. With no home to return to, the survivors hurtle through space in a massive warship—the Galactica in question—in permanent transit, hoping to someday come across the fabled homeworld of Earth. Scattered Hopes essentially shrinks down this premise. Instead of trying to find a new Eden, you're piloting a couple of junkers that are attempting to track down the Galactica and join the convoy. As such, you'll spend much of your time in space shoring up all sorts of different logistical crises. Do we have enough fuel? Enough supplies? Is morale too low? Do our fighter ships need repairs? All those questions must be addressed before the Cylons appear on the horizon, launching an attack on your ragtag armada, which must be fended off while charging up a faster-than-light drive, in order to jump to the next sector.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action brings to mind FTL, perhaps the greatest of all space-faring roguelikes. Scattered Hopes oscillates between white-knuckle tension when the Cylons demonstrate their incredible force, but much of your time in this game will be oddly dulcet. Tech trees will be dutifully filled out with upgrades, providing more fighters, better medbays, and tougher hull exteriors. Lonely travellers cross our paths, and join forces. Staff level up, and develop new traits. This is all rendered in a beautiful semi-retro pixelated style. The ships look great, but I'm especially taken by the dank, gritty interiors—the slate-grey hanger bay, the tech lab glowing with computer screens. Battlestar Galactica might be a dystopia, but it has also always been a spaceship I wanted to explore. Scattered Hopes captures that in spades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even more importantly, Scattered Hopes does its best to inject some legitimate narrative tension into what is, ultimately, a procedurally generated adventure. For instance: At one point you may be alerted by a lieutenant that the air filtration systems on your ship are on the fritz. Once it's repaired, you have the choice of either reprimanding the workers who installed those faulty mechanisms, or blame the underworld traders for providing bad materials. Your choice will alter your personal reputation with either of those factions—there are gameplay consequences at play—but they also add a splash of color to the run. An apt comparison might be Frostpunk, another game that melds horrific humanitarian catastrophes with nuts-and-bolts optimization.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When the Cylons come, as they always do, Scattered Hopes pivots from being a turn-based management sim into a straight-up real-time strategy game. The onslaught almost mirrors a tower defense set-up. You'll be fielding a small handful of fighters—ideally piloted by a curated selection of aces—who must fend off the assault for a specific amount of time. The Cylons all tend to make a beeline for the heart of the armada, laying waste to your few civilian ships. So, expert captains will put their fighters in position to create something of a chokepoint, letting them mow down the Cylons upon entry. (One of the few advantages we're given as players is knowledge of where the enemies are going to spawn from.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When the Cylons come, as they always do, Scattered Hopes pivots from being a turn-based management sim into a straight-up real-time strategy game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, what the Cylons lack in brains they more than make up for in scale, and the deeper you get into a run, you'll start facing down some insurmountable odds. That's when the flagships come in. They're outfitted with both tactical heat-seeking missiles and board-clearing nukes that glitter in the void and vaporize everything within the blast radius. The action can get pretty technical, and extremely overwhelming. Engagements can be won or lost if players are a split-second late on an important maneuvering decision. When things get out of hand, Cylons can absolutely melt the health bars of your most important assets. Thankfully, Scattered Hopes does offer a real-time combat pause, letting you mete out orders deliberately, without being constantly under fire. To play the game correctly, you'll likely be tapping that space bar every other second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of combat you'll quickly scurry the fighters back to their docking ports and blast off to the next zone, with a collection of fresh bullet holes left in your hull. More crises will pop up, more repairs will need to be completed, and when the Cylons return, they will almost certainly be more dangerous than before. The thing my time with Scattered Hopes seemed most eager to hammer home is that this is a difficult video game—beholden to plenty of good RNG, as roguelikes always are, but also your own management chops. Battlestar Galactica, after all, is a franchise all about doing just enough to stay alive for another day. Scattered Hopes is eager to honor that legacy. I'm hoping it can pull it off.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-aims-to-deliver-an-ftl-like-roguelike]]></content:encoded>

It's a single-player, first-person soulslike taking place in an alt-history Eastern Europe during a fictionalized version of Napoleon's invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Valor Mortis, you play as William, a French soldier who died in battle, and who has mysteriously come back with the power to control a corrupting, plague-like substance called the Nephtoglobin. The Nephtoglobin has corrupted his former comrades-in-arms, but William can use it to fight against Napoleon and his army to reclaim his home.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Valor Mortis looks plenty gory and gruesome, with all sorts of body horror going on as enemies turn into increasingly messed up zombie things from the effects of the Nephtoglobin. In turn, finding more of that substance appears to enhance your own abilities, letting you do things like shoot fire out of your hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valor Mortis is planned for a 2026 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series consoles. A closed playtest will be held in the coming weeks, and you can sign up for it on the official website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">catch up on everything announced at Gamescom ONL right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">They're promising it'll be good this time.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">So, Bubsy's back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You know, Bubsy, the talking orange bobcat mascot from the 90s? He's back, with a new 3D game developed by indie studio Fabraz and published by Atari. It's called Bubsy 4D, and it's Bubsy's first 3D adventure since 1996's (notoriously not very good) Bubsy 3D.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bubsy 4D brings back the alien Woolies, who have returned to Earth to steal its sheep and empower them with Woolie tech. But then, the sheep revolt, creating the BaaBots, who fight back and regain control of The Golden Fleece. Bubsy, in turn, must get the fleece back from the BaaBots, who have taken over planets formerly belonging to the Woolies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Bubsy, many familiar faces from his past games are making a return: Terri, Terry, Virgil, and Oblivia. Bubsy 4D will feature a lot that's familiar: 3D movement, platforming, and collectibles. There are also online time trials, and a new hairball form for Bubsy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Bubsy 3D didn't exactly go over amazingly. The game initially launched to critical reviews of its controls and camera, and it's only become further panned ever since, even earning spots on some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/15/30-worst-video-games-of-all-time-part-one" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worst games of all time</a> lists. Notably, though, it seems that the studio behind it is aware of its reputation and is being at least a bit cheeky about it:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been a wild ride to work on a sequel to Bubsy 3D, considering its infamous legacy." said Fabian Rastorfer at Fabraz in a press release. "It was really important for us to take this challenge seriously by both identifying what's made the bobcat stick around for so long, while also reinventing parts of the series to work better. I believe Bubsy's move-set is stronger than ever and anyone who's played our previous games will feel right at home with this expressive 3D platformer. I'm incredibly proud of the world we've created and I can't WAIT to see everyone's reactions to this announcement. Surprise!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bubsy 4D is coming to PlayStation 5 and 4, Xbox Series and One, Nintendo Switch 1 and 2, and PC at a later date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
