            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/655949/switch-2-in-person-preorder-gamestop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655361/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sold-out-walmart-gamestop-target">are sold out online everywhere</a>. But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/654944/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gamestop-mario-kart-world-bundle">going to GameStop</a> and preordering one in store. </p><p>In addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, its <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> bundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick and mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine.</p><p>I missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I remembered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lnkymmvwec2x">seeing a post on Bluesky from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. </p><p>I saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio opened soon and I was no more than a 15 minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days.</p><p>“It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said.</p><p>Other than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console. </p><p>“The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me. </p><p>“I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased.</p><p>“That doesn’t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man. Others mentioned the state of the US economy and with inflation impacting consumer goods across the board, the price of the Switch 2 itself seemed reasonable. “The OLED Switch when it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">was $350</a>,” said another man. “One hundred dollars more, almost 10 years later, not that bad.”</p><p>And while the price of the console doesn’t much bother this Akron crop of Switch 2 enthusiasts, the rising cost of games was another matter entirely. “The pricing for the games is a little steep for my tastes,” said the lady at the front of the line. I followed up by asking if that would impact her spending habits on games in the future. “No. The price is not going to affect that, it’s just going to make me upset.”</p><p>That was the sentiment of most everyone I spoke to. Nintendo’s pricing makes sense given everything going on with inflation and tariffs, and even if the higher prices do sting, it’s Nintendo. “I think it’s worth it,” a mother told me as she was waiting in line with her son and husband.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Me and Bu at the local Gamestop</figcaption> <cite>Photo: Ash Parrish / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>was the first game out of everyone’s mouth when I asked what they were most excited to play at launch. Everyone in line was hoping to score the <em>Mario Kart World</em> Switch 2 bundle that essentially gets you the game at a $30 discount. Every so often, a GameStop employee would take a tally of the customers who wanted a bundle. He’d point to a person in line — who was well ahead of me — and say, “you’re the last.” </p><p>According to a sign on the door, that location had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles. But throughout my time in line, I overheard them say to customers that they expect to have more units available to be purchased when the console launches on June 5th. Since everybody wanted a <em>Mario Kart</em> bundle, I resigned myself to only getting a regular Switch 2 — a far better prospect than the one I faced this morning of not getting any Switch at all. But as the line moved, the employees found more and more Switch 2 bundles. When finally during one of the tallys one employee pointed to me and said I would be the last one to get one.</p><p>And I did. </p><p>With Bu strapped ever so patiently to my back, I preordered a Switch 2 <em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle and threw an extra five bucks down on<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. I shouldn’t be all that surprised this worked out as well as it did, sometimes the old ways simply work best.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Unknown Worlds has shared a first in-game look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, as part of a new developer video charting the highly anticipated underwater survival sequel's "road to early access".
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> expansion Below Zero) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-subnautica-game-is-in-early-development">confirmed to be in the works</a> all the way back in 2022. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">first trailer finally arrived last October</a>, but it was purely a scene-setting cinematic - tipping a nod to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-responds-to-publisher-claims-its-a-multiplayer-live-service-game">sequel's new co-op mode</a> - rather than offering any actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead seven months, and we've now been given a first glimpse of how Subnautica 2 looks in-game. Unknown Worlds shared the early footage as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo">Road to Early Access developer video</a>, in which Subnautica 2 design lead Anthony Gallegos offered a small taste of things to come across the update's brief runtime.

<p>
During his chatter, we got a tease of some new environments - including what appears to be the Subnautica 2 equivalent of the first game's Safe Shallows (the sequel is set on a brand-new world) and a bioluminescent underground area - plus a few new aquatic creatures. There's a second or two of a strange waddling thing with a fan-like tail, for instance, and a large fish headbutting rocks. We also got a peek at co-operative swimming and base building.
</p>
<p>
It's not a lot to go on, admittedly, and the studio still hasn't announced an early access release date. All we know right now is it's due to launch "later" this year for Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam and Epic), and it's coming to Game Pass too.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Unknown Worlds said it expected Subnautica 2 to launch into early access with its co-op multiplayer mode, "several biomes, some narrative, and a variety of creatures and craftables". There's plenty of time for things to evolve from there, too, given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-launching-with-multiplayer-and-several-biomes-but-early-access-will-last-2-to-3-years">studio is anticipating</a> early access will last "about two to three years."

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/red-candle-games">Red Candle Games</a> are probably more frequently remembered as a horror developer, what with their first couple of games being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detention">Detention</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">slightly troubled</a> (but very good) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a>. Surprisingly, their follow-up to the latter wasn't another horror game, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nine-sols">Nine Sols</a>, a Sekiro-inspired 2D action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a> that just looks stunning in motion. It was a welcome surprise! Developers should never feel beholden to expectations, and Red Candle Games have once again offered up a lovely little surprise in the form of a Nine Sols prequel manga.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As it turns out, the reason for its existence is a pretty simple one: the devs just had too much story for one game (but mostly "time constraints and other factors"). So, as they explain in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1809540/announcements/detail/544481587857719320">Steam post</a>, last year they "established a partnership with Mojoin", a site for a whole bunch of webcomics, as well as hooked up with artist Yang Chi-Cheng. "As a result, what was once an extravagant idea for us gradually became a reality through the collective efforts of everyone involved, especially with the invaluable contributions of Mr. Yang," Red Candle Games explained.
</p>
<p>
The plot is set "long before" Nine Sols itself, though I'm not sure how long before, and focuses on two Solarians who "forever altered the course of Penglai’s history." The manga is also, quite conveniently available in English alongside Chinese and Japanese, and the first chapter is <a href="https://mojoin.com/comics/224#chapter">already available to read too</a>. Update will apparently be coming weekly on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
I haven't actually had the good fortune of playing Nine Sols just yet, our own Nic liked it so much it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nine-sols-review">turned him around on the genre</a>, so I've only had a skim of the manga myself. Therefore, I can't really speak to the story all that much, but the artwork is great. Lots of confident linework that captures the style of the game very well. What a treat! Perhaps it's time for me to pick the game up…

The controller releases on June 5th, the same day as the Switch 2, but Nintendo will be making it available to order ahead of that date.</p><p>Initially, the controller will be available to buy from May 8th to May 12th to people who receive direct invitations from Nintendo to buy a Switch 2, according to a footnote on the controller’s listing. Starting May 13th, Nintendo will offer it to people who pay for a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. Nintendo will limit purchases to one per Nintendo Account.</p><p>The controller looks very similar to the original GameCube one, but the Switch 2 version is wireless and has some additional buttons to match what’s on other Switch 2 controllers.

On the Switch 2’s launch date, the GameCube lineup will include <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>Soulcalibur II</em>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, April 24th</strong>: Added that Nintendo will limit to one controller per Nintendo Account.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Set in the occult office space world of<em> Control</em>, the co-op experience is unlike anything the <em>Alan Wake 2</em> maker has ever done before and it now has a release date. The Finnish studio revealed that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> is out in June and shared details about the game’s battle pass that make it sound very similar to the one in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196860,197541" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Announced during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream with the developers on Thursday</a></span>, <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 17 at the price of $40. As previously confirmed, it’ll also be available via Game Pass on console and PC, as well as PlayStation Plus via the Extra and Premier tiers. Most importantly, Remedy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536600287259918382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained on Steam</a></span> how the game’s post-launch content will roll out and be monetized. </p><p>Similar to <em>Helldivers 2's </em>Warbonds, <em>Firebreak</em>’s battle passes are called Requisitions. There will be free and paid tiers, each unlocking new weapons, cosmetics, and other items. The “free” Requisitions are purchased with in-game currency while the premium ones are purchased with real money. All Requisitions will also remain permanently available in-game, following the trend kicked-off by <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and others. </p><p>Here’s how the grind works in more detail, per Remedy:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Earn Lost Assets by completing Jobs.</li><li>Spend them to unlock items in any Requisition you have acquired.</li><li>Unlocking items isn’t fully linear; rather, you can choose what you want to unlock.</li><li>You can progress multiple Requisitions at once.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So yes, for anyone who’s played <em>Helldivers 2</em> it should all sound pretty familiar. It makes sense for <em>Firebreak </em>to borrow from that system given both games following a similar session-based PVE gameplay loop. Remedy also confirmed plans for ongoing free post-launch updates in the form of two new missions coming after release, with additional content slated to arrive in 2026. </p><p>But it doesn’t sound like Remedy’s trying to drown players in an endless grind. Instead, <em>Firebreak</em> sounds like live service gaming-lite: it’s not a game you ever really “beat” but it also isn’t meant to feel like a second job, another balancing act <em>Helldivers 2</em> nailed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Control fans eager to return to the depth of the Oldest House won't have long to wait. Remedy Entertainment has confirmed its three-player PvE Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, releases for PC and consoles on 17th June, with talk of plenty of post-launch support to come.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">unveiled last October</a>, promising a co-operative take on the Control universe in which players, cast as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak response unit, must keep the Oldest House's numerous paranatural anomalies - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreaks-latest-trailer-brings-extradimensional-furnaces-and-exploding-pink-goo">weird pink goo</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">sentient Post-It notes</a> - in check. Each Job takes players to different corners of the ever-changing building - some familiar and some new - and features different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
Remedy offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8">another look at FBC: Firebreak in its latest developer livestream</a> earlier today, sharing details about the game's battle-pass-style progression system, Requisitions. These come in two flavours: standard Requisitions, which are free to all players, and premium Classified Requisitions, which must be purchased with real money.

<p>
Standard Requisitions contain weapons, armour, and equipment that can be unlocked using in-game currency earned through play, while items in Classified Requisitions are cosmetic only with no gameplay benefits. Notably, there's no expiration date on Requisitions, meaning players can unlock items in their own time. In addition to Requisitions, Remedy has outlined its post-launch content plans, confirming it intends to release at least new Jobs in 2025, with more coming next year. These will be free to all players.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830">Epic</a>) on 17th June. The standard edition costs £32.99/€39.99/$39.99 USD, and it'll also be available on day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Those looking for something a bit fancier can pick up FBC: Firebreak's Deluxe Edition which costs £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD and throws in a variety of premium cosmetics. These include the Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Golden Firebreak spray, the Firestarter armour set, the Scorched Remnant double-barrel shotgun skin, plus the premium Firestarter Classified Requisition, which features 36 unlockable cosmetics. Remedy notes standard edition owners can upgrade to the Deluxe version for £7/€10/$10.

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has announced that co-op <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is launching on 17th June, dropping onto PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and Epic.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will set you back $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99, but will also be available day one via&nbsp;PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog (Extra and Premium). A Deluxe Edition will be $49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99, or an upgrade for the difference of $10 / €10 / £7.</p>


<p>The announcement came through the April Developer Update which also gave a longer look at a newly revealed mission, Hot Fix, as well as another look at &nbsp;Paper Chase, where sticky notes have been all spookified.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak Developer Update April 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other Jobs revealed so far have also showed&nbsp;a Furnace that spread fire across the Maintenance Sector, needing players to turn on sprinklers and fans to douse the flames, or the pink Exogenic Mass, which explodes if you touch it.</p>

<p>Of course, you’ll have some buddies by your side to give you some morale-boosting pats on the back to get back to work. FBC: Firebreak is a three-player co-op shooter, loosely in the vein of Left 4 Dead. In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.</p>
<p>Playing the game will tap into a system of rewards called Requisitions, which are a free way to unlock cosmetics and gear like weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more using in-game currency earned through gameplay. There will be no limited-time windows or rotating stores, so no FOMO.</p>
<p>Classified Requisitions are the premium counterpart, which can be purchased with real money and will always be purely cosmetic. You can see these with the Deluxe Edition, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Remedy also gave a look at the longer term picture for the game. Post-launch two more missions will be added to the game through 2025, with more updates planned for 2026. All playable content will be free to all players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not long now before we get to set foot back in the Oldest House to blow up small pieces of paper!</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/electronic-arts/">EA</a> has announced the release dates for both Madden NFL 26 and EA Sports College Football 26, and confirmed that there will be no Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions of both games, leaving behind the last-gen versions five years after the launch of the current generation.</p>
<p>EA Sports College Football 26 will launch on&nbsp;<strong>July 10, 2025</strong> and will be available three days earlier for players who purchase early access through the Deluxe Edition, while Madden NFL 26 will arrive on <strong>August 14, 2025,</strong> and will also be available three days earlier for those who grab the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>If you were already planning on grabbing both games, EA has a<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/bundles/mvp-bundle/buy"> bundle</a> you can grab that'll get you both games when they release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 &amp; College Football 26 Announce Trailer | The Call" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIp9SMjNH1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition for Madden NFL 26 nabs you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 Madden Points</li>
<li>Season 1 Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Cover Athlete Elite Player Item</li>
<li>Superstar Legendary XP Boost</li>
<li>Franchise Coach ability points</li>
<li>Player card exclusive item</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Deluxe Edition for EA Sports College Football 26 gets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three days early access</li>
<li>4600 College Football Points</li>
<li>Top Prospect Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>All Hands Ultimate Team Pack</li>
<li>Dynasty Coach Points</li>
<li>Road to Glory Skill Points</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVP Bundle, which is what you'll want to get if you were getting both games anyway, gets you all of the above along with a few bundle exclusive items for either game. If you pre-order the bundle ahead of April 29, 2025, you'll always get the Travis Hunter 99 OVR player item in both Madden NFL 26 and College Football 26.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-july-2024-report-reveals-ea-sports-college-football-25-is-an-instant-hit/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> was a smash-success for EA last year, with the series returning after being on hiatus for a decade. It'll be interesting to see if that same success can be repeated, or even surpassed this year. Sports games are a consistent seller every year, and it's doubtful that the same fans who flooded to buy the first official college football video game in 10 years are satiated by just one new release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another board game developer is scaling back production in response to the volatile global trade environment. CMON, the developer behind works like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/massive-darkness-2-hellscape-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Massive Darkness</em></a>, will pause all board game development and crowdfunding projects.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.cmon.com/press/an-update-on-our-internal-teams-and-company-focus/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, CMON posted a brief three-paragraph statement. The statement explains that the company will be immediately pausing all board game development alongside any crowdfunding projects.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=XkpUnsYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cmon-zombicide-board-game.jpg?itok=EJ1oFyPk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a result, CMON will be making reductions in creative teams. Though no numbers or specific departments are mentioned, the statement does remark that the employees laid off will be missed professionally and personally.</p>

<p>The reasons given for the tabletop company's major decision is the recent trade tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese imports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The industry continues to rapidly evolve, and unpredictable situations like the recent tariffs, or COVID just a few years ago, present challenges for everyone in board games. With that said, it is our responsibility to take these difficult measures to ensure that we can keep current projects on track and deliver them in a timely manner. We will of course resume new development as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The vast majority of board game production happens overseas in China and is then imported back to the US. Due to the trade tariffs, production costs have jumped up exponentially. Since there is no infrastructure to bring the same level of production locally, studios have had to make difficult business decisions in response to this devastating complication to the industry.</p>

<p>CMON is the latest studio to scale down or suspend tabletop game development as a response to the uncertain chaotic trade environment caused by the Trump administration. An environment that has already lead to closures by developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a> by Stonemaier Games.</p>

<p>CMON's tabletop game development history is packed with beloved entries. Their catalog includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide</em></a> series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/song-of-ice-fire-tactics-fully-funded-in-under-7-hours" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tactics</em></a>, localizing several <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Japanese TTRPGs</a>, and officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/metal-gear-solid-board-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne</em> board games</a>.</p>

It’ll be available on PC (both Steam and the Epic Game Store), the PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available on subscription platforms Game Pass and PlayStation Plus.</p><p>Set in the <em>Control</em> universe a few years after the original game, <em>Firebreak</em> is a three player co-op shooter where players take on missions inside of the headquarters of the FBC — Federal Bureau of Control — which has become overrun by supernatural forces. “The game features highly replayable missions known as Jobs, each uniquely designed with different challenges, objectives, and environments that require teamwork and adaptability,” Remedy explains.</p><p>The new game will be a paid release, priced at $39.99, and it sounds like it will be a nice change of pace from demanding live-service games. The studio says that, while there are updates planned for after launch, “all future playable content, including new Jobs, will be free. Players will have the option to purchase cosmetics, but none of these items will affect gameplay, and there will be no limited-time rotations or daily log-ins. ”</p><p>You can see some of the game in action here:</p><div><p><em>Firebreak</em> is part of <em>Remedy</em>’s plan to build <em>Control</em>’s supernatural universe into something much bigger.

On top of that, you'll also be able to take part in online co-op battles through the Red Light Raid mode, teaming you up with players around the world to shake down the seedy underworld of the game's infamous districts.</p><p>One thing to note about this release is that it's a Game-Key Card version. Essentially, this means that you'll still need to download Yakuza 0 onto your Switch 2 and the cartridge will act as an authentication device. Game-Key cards are not tied to your Nintendo account, so if you want to sell the game when you're done with it, it will work fine on a different Switch 2 console. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you've never played Yakuza 0, then you've missed out on one of the best games that Sega has ever published. Set in 1988 Japan during its financial boom, the game is an origin story for longtime Yakuza characters Kiryu Kazuma and Goro Majima, revealing how they became the legends known as the Dragon of Dojima and the Mad Dog of Shimano, respectively. At its core, Yakuza 0 is a 3D beat-'em-up with a heavy emphasis on storytelling, with major beats in the game playing out like episodes of a gangland drama series.</p><p>The game is also packed with diversions, as there are side stories to explore between missions and numerous mini-games to take part in. Kiryu even gets to take part in a side-hustle invests in real estate in Kamurocho, while Goro runs a cabaret club in Sotenbori. Both modes are surprisingly deep, and either one could work well as a standalone game.</p><hr><p>Yakuza 0: Director's Cut is one of several Sega-published games that'll be released for the Switch 2.

In Japan, Nintendo is holding Switch 2 lotteries, where people submit their names for a chance to preorder the upcoming console. The idea is to cut down on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-units-are-already-dropping-on-ebay-some-arent-what-they-seem/1100-6531090/" data-ref-id="1100-6531090">scalpers hoarding systems and selling them at exorbitant prices</a>, and to avoid the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/">chaotic mess of online free-for-alls</a>, but it seems unscrupulous actors are taking advantage of the situation in other ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Some consumers received emails telling them it was their turn to purchase a Switch 2 and directing them to click on a link that would take them somewhere that was definitely not the Nintendo Store.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have confirmed phishing emails disguised as the results of the My Nintendo Store 'Nintendo Switch 2' lottery sale," Nintendo said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1915369995934326801" rel="nofollow ">X</a> (translated via Google). "The lottery results sent today will not include a URL for the purchase procedure due to a change in the processing period. If there is a URL for reservations or purchases, it was not sent by our company. Please be careful."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America is hosting a similar, albeit more restrictive, sign-up process where people who meet specific requirements can register their Nintendo Accounts for a chance to preorder a Switch 2 on the Nintendo Store. Nintendo will send an invitation to purchase the system in May, though some may not receive invitations until after the June 5 launch. The phishing attempts tied to the Japanese Switch 2 lottery occasionally used hard-to-spot methods of covering their tracks, such as minor misspellings or URLs connected to other regions. If you receive such an email, make sure to verify that it's actually from Nintendo before proceeding.</p>

			<p>During a special livestream that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just aired</a>, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment announced the final release date for its first multiplayer game, FBC: Firebreak. The cooperative first-person shooter game for up to three players will be launched for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on June 17, priced at $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, it will also be available on day one via Microsoft's PC Game Pass/Game Pass Ultimate and Sony's PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers in a bid to maximize the player base from the get-go.</p>
<p>Remedy is also releasing a Deluxe Edition, priced at&nbsp;$49.99 / €49.99 / £39.99. This edition includes exclusive cosmetic items and voice packs that allow players to customize their audiovisual identity.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak Deluxe Edition includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The Firestarter” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>“The Pencil Pusher” Premium Voice Pack</li>
<li>Firestarter Armor Set, Apex Revision (Helmet, Body Armor, Gloves)</li>
<li>Scorched Remnant Double-Barrel Shotgun Skin</li>
<li>Golden Firebreak Spray</li>
<li>Classified Requisition: “Firestarter”: A collection of 36 unlockable cosmetic items, including weapon skins, sprays, and armor sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Owners of the base game can upgrade to the Deluxe Edition at any time for $10.00 / €10.00 / £7.00.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak Developer Update April 2025" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0s2x2a35wP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During today's live stream, Remedy also briefed fans on the post-launch support. Two new Jobs (missions) will be released later in 2025, while even more updates will be made available throughout 2026. As the studio previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-info-all-post-launch-content-will-be-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, all post-launch content will be free, and monetization will be limited to cosmetic-only items.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is powered by Remedy's proprietary Northlight engine, previously seen in Control and Alan Wake 2. However, being a multiplayer game first and foremost, the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-will-have-lower-pc-requirements-than-remedys-single-player-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken care to optimize it</a> to be more accessible to a wider range of PC configurations. Even so, high-end features like path tracing (already implemented in Alan Wake 2) and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be supported on PC.</p>

<p>Remedy revealed the news in a livestream this evening, although due to the time altering world event known as embargoed press releases, I'm writing this before the stream goes live on Remedy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/RemedyGames">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/remedygames">Twitch</a> channels. Thus, I can only guess what the reveal looked like for the new job, Hot Fix. 'Jobs' are what they're calling the repeatable missions you'll play through in the titular Federal Bureau Of Control, one of gaming's finest mind-melting bureaucratic horror institutions. A Housing Benefit Form Desk Of Leaves, if you will.</p>
<p>Firebreak is Remedy's first foray into the Getting That Potentially Infinite Bag world of live service, which, inevitably, means cosmetics. There are two types, the first being 'Requisitions' ("weapons, equipment, armor, sprays, and more") that'll be sold for an in-game currency you'll earn by playing. No timers or rotating stores for these, either. The second, 'Classified requisitions' ("armor sets, custom voice packs, sprays, and weapon skins"), will cost you. "The items are purely cosmetic, have no gameplay impact, and will remain available permanently," Remedy say. This all sounds like it'll be funding post-launch support, with new jobs planned as early as this year.</p>
<p>Edwin had a chat with Remedy about their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/controls-office-junior-firebreak-cant-decide-if-its-a-job">approach to live service recently</a>, in which they basically say that their 'We did not make Firebreak just to get that potentially infinite bag' t-shirts are raising a lot of questions already answered by the shirts. Personally, I'm torn between being reflexively iffy about this stuff on principle while also believing Remedy deserve a fat payday, every day, and rubbing my hands together in glee over what sort of stupidly self-indulgent, brilliant art they can make with the funds. Oh! Oh! I'm coining 'Deep Bloc Galactic'. Because of brutalism, right? Little gift there for you. Nice little Thursday treat.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Interestingly, <em>Madden 26</em> is finally leaving behind the aging PS4 and Xbox One. Since 2013, <em>Madden </em>has launched on those consoles every year, but no more. Last year’s <em>Madden 25</em> will be the last EA football game to launch on last-gen machines. Funnily enough, the first <em>Madden </em>to launch on Xbox One and PS4 was also called <em>Madden 25</em>, as the franchise was celebrating its 25 year anniversary. Weird stuff! </p><p>It’s a year of change for <em>Madden</em>, because not only is it skipping consoles it has released on for over a decade, but EA is bringing the football series back to Nintendo platforms.<em> Madden 26 </em>is set to launch on Switch 2 in August alongside the other versions of the game on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. This is the first time a <em>Madden </em>game has appeared on a Nintendo platform since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012's<em> Madden NFL 13</em>. That game launched on Wii and Wii U</a></span>. </p><p>Weirdly, only <em>Madden</em> is making the leap to Switch 2<em>. EA College Football 26</em> will not be available on Nintendo’s new console. Last year,<em> EA College Football 25 </em>became one of the best selling games in the United States after fans waited a decade to play another EA Sports college football game. (The last one was released in 2013.) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118"><em>EA College Football 25 </em>already skipped PS4 and Xbox One last year</a></span>, so its not surprising they are skipping it again this year. </p><p><em> Madden NFL 26</em> launches for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14.<em> College Football 26 </em>launches on July 10. You can pay EA a ransom fee to play three days early via the $100 <em>Madden NFL 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.” On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, a $150 “MVP Bundle” is also available, and it comes with <em>College Football 26</em> “Deluxe Edition.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
