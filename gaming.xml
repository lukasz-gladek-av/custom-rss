			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-5-update-available-now-adding-three-new-characters/">new update</a> for Honkai: Star Rail is set to <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/pcbranding?utm_source=SNS&amp;utm_medium=CM_YouTube&amp;utm_campaign=YTVer25PGC&amp;is_retargeting=true&amp;c=YTVer25PGC&amp;pid=CM_YouTube&amp;af_adset=CMv25&amp;af_reengagement_window=lifetime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release on October 23</a>, taking players on a new journey in the update titled 'Annals of Pinecany's Mappou Age.' As announced by miHoYo, the update will see Trailblazers going to Penacony's Paperfold University, which is one of the most prestigious universities in the region. A new semester is about to begin, alongside anniversary celebrations. In this update, players will get to pull for a new 5-star character named Rappa. Rappa is a Galaxy Ranger and is released in this update in conjunction with the Simulated Universe DLC, which is getting a huge update. All of the new features and news about the upcoming update were announced during the Special Program Livestream.</p>
<p>Rappa is trying to hunt down her nemesis Evil Ninja Osaru, who is hidden somewhere in the Cosmos. To participate in battle, she recites Ninja mantras, which create Dazzling Ninja Seals, and also follows the Way of the Ninja through Ninja scrolls, graffiti, and comics. As part of Rappa's release, players will be invited to participate in the Sound Hunt Ninjustsu Inscription event, where Trailblazers are invited as guests to step in and become band managers for the Dreamlight Anniversary music party.</p>

<p>To celebrate the release of Honkai: Star Rail version 2.6, miHoYo released a trailer that is just under three minutes and showcases some of the upcoming features from the update. This update takes place after the adventure in Xianzhou has concluded, and now players will be returning to Penacony to explore the Paperfold University. In addition to Rappa joining the roster of characters, players will be able to try to pull for returning 5-star characters such as Dan Heng, Imbibitor Lunae, Acheron, and Aventurine.</p>
<p>After the release of Swarm Disaster and Gold and Gears, this update will see the third Simulated Universe DLC,&nbsp; where a massive void named the Unknowable Domain has emerged inside the Simulated Universe. At first, it was simulating the Scholars Strife, which was a post-Second Emperor's War event where scholarly factions battled for the Scepter system. In this DLC, players will be charged with the mission of collecting Scepters, building up their power, and enhancing them with Components to make their abilities even stronger.</p>
<p>For those excited to get stuck into the upcoming Honkai: Star Rail update, you won't have to wait much longer. The update is just 12 days away from the time of writing.</p>
<p>Who will you be pulling for in this new Honkai: Star Rail update?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced-for-february.1007208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crystal Dynamics and porting studio Aspyr have announced&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em>, a collection of remasters of classic&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games that's set to release in February.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-reveal-100-million-games-sold-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>website, Crystal Dynamics celebrates the 28th anniversary of the franchise (which feels like a rather odd milestone to celebrate), as well as revealing that the series as a whole has sold over 100 million units worldwide since its inception.</p>
<p>Per the post, the new collection will include&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: Chronicles</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</em>, all of which will receive Aspyr's customary glow-up in terms of visuals and controls.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announcement-shooting.jpg?itok=QdR3b7HC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announcement-shooting.jpg?itok=lQSxbILY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered&nbsp;</em>collects three more of Lara's classic adventures in February.</figcaption></figure><p>All three games will, according to Crystal Dynamics, include the ability to switch between the classic visuals and the modern overhauls on the fly, as well as a choice between "new modern controls" and classic&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>-style tank controls.</p>
<p>Quality-of-life improvements have also been added across the board, like boss health bars, a Photo Mode, and achievements and trophies on supported platforms (sorry, Nintendo Switch players).</p>
<p>This collection follows on from Aspyr's remasters of the first three&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games, which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered">announced back in September last year</a> and released earlier this year.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Aspyr handles porting and remaster work on 2003's&nbsp;<em>Angel of Darkness</em>, which is widely regarded as a drastic misfire among the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>community, albeit one with a huge amount of potential.</p>

<p>This set of remasters is also just one in a long line of classic PS1-era ports handled by Aspyr; others include the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>collection</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-remaster"><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></a>&nbsp;and more.</p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009064" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tomb-raider-iv-vi/9P4ZKKX7V5ZQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on February 14th, which means you can pick it up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">alongside&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>for a nice change of pace.</p>

In Altus’s <em>Persona</em>-like RPG, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, there are the class options you’d expect from the genre, so you might expect to be told the best possible choice to most enjoy the game. It’s just…it doesn’t work like that here. It’s <em>better</em>.<br></p><p>I’ve been giving tips about video games on the internet ever since I was old enough to type “hellom my name is timoby monbleau XD” on whichever message board my dial-up connection could load first. Over that lifetime of experience, I typically see the same questions appear when it comes to RPGs like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>: “What are the best characters to use? What are the best builds? Which classes should I pick to make the game easier? Why do I see Mega Man in my dreams?”</p><p>Typically, my advice for questions like these is “experiment and figure out what works for you!” Because, sure, there’s <em>always</em> an optimal build, and there’s <em>always</em> an optimal class to pick. But trying different party configurations is one of the most fun parts of a class system in an RPG, and I firmly believe that it’s okay to do 20 less damage per turn in the name of having more fun with your 70+ hour game.</p><p>I’m here to give this same advice about <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, but not strictly because I value class experimentation more than optimal play. Actually, Metaphor’s classes (called “Archetypes” in-game) are so well-designed that experimentation often <em>is</em> the optimal play. If you’re ready to begin your journey to become king, let’s break down why you shouldn’t worry about whether or not you’re using the “best” class at any given time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-recommend-id="image://bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-recommend-id="image://bce524b49266aadb2dad0a7f03a9c637" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Three humanoid characters look bewildered by the ground in front of them as “I?” symbols appear over their heads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’ve played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-free-demo-ps5-xbox-rpg-persona-6-1851657040">the demo of <em>Metaphor</em></a></span>, you’ll know its battle system is one part <em>Persona</em> and two parts <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>. It uses the “Press Turn” mechanic from the latter series, in which both your party and your enemies can exploit the weaknesses of the other to earn extra moves during a turn. Hitting elemental weaknesses is standard procedure for RPGs, but if an enemy can exploit <em>your</em> weaknesses and chain attacks, the tide of battle will quickly change.</p><p>Your characters’ weaknesses and resistances are determined by their equipped Archetype. And no matter how leveled up a certain Archetype may be, you’re often better off switching to another low-level Archetype if it means gaining a resistance to an enemy’s attacks. Some bosses will even lull you into a false sense of security by having a weakness to an element that one Archetype specializes in, only to use attacks that specifically target that Archetype’s weakness. In cases like these, stubbornly sticking to your established party composition is often more trouble than it’s worth. This is especially true because…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-recommend-id="image://cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-recommend-id="image://cc1ce6e99b4ada65e26abb0511c71c5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl equipping two skills that his equipped Archetype can’t normally use." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re a fan of games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> or <em>Bravely Default</em>, you know that mixing and matching the skills of different classes can create diabolically powerful synergies. In <em>Metaphor</em>, each Archetype can initially inherit one skill from any Archetype the equipping character has leveled up. This does require a one-time fee of the MAG currency, but unlocked skills can be attached to any Archetype that character uses from that point onward. As you advance your Follower relationships (think Social Links from <em>Persona</em>), each of your Archetypes can inherit even more skills.</p><p>With a little planning, this system lets you come up with some incredible combos. For instance, a physical character who bounces between the Warrior and Brawler Archetypes can use skills like Battle Cry and the Heat Up passive to optimize their damage output. Alternatively, you can switch a character to an Archetype that specifically resists a boss’ attacks while still keeping the most important skills you’ll need for the fight. A Mage will struggle against bosses that inflict Piercing damage, but magic users can just switch to the Healer Archetype and keep whichever elemental spell they’d use anyway!</p><p>Even if you don’t want to optimize your party for a specific encounter, inheriting skills lets you fulfill class fantasies that the game might not support out the gate. For instance, I enjoyed equipping Strohl with the Seeker Archetype alongside the Healer’s restorative spells to emulate a Paladin like Cecil from <em>Final Fantasy 4</em>. In a game all about the power of fantasy, it’s fitting that the only limit for your character builds is your imagination. Well, that and the literal limits imposed by the game’s mechanics, but clarifying sentences like this are not how I passed my 9th Grade English class.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-recommend-id="image://41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-recommend-id="image://41a31d2b8917bd86556f9bcf69c46a6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in heavy armor stands with their arms outstretched as they stand on a carriage being pulled by a horse at high speed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Archetypes do feature a handful of skills that you <em>can’t</em> pass down, but don’t worry, these ones are worth building your team around. Synergy skills in <em>Metaphor</em> are kind of like Double Techs and Triple Techs from <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which I am legally obligated to call “probably the best game of all time” as per the orders of the All People Of Millennial Age Or Older Coalition™. That is to say, if you have the right combination of Archetypes in your party, characters can use especially powerful skills that cost two or three turn icons to use.</p><p>Even from the earliest moments in the game, Synergy skills can turn arduous encounters into a total breeze. For example, Mages can’t use multi-target skills on their own, but Synergy skills let them use their elemental attacks on every enemy at once. Some Archetypes can learn seriously awesome support skills, such as buffs that affect every party member’s stats with a single cast. The Seeker lineage of Archetypes can even hit weaknesses via Synergy skills that they wouldn’t be able to exploit on their own!</p><p>You do need to be careful with these moves, as consuming multiple turn icons at once can sometimes put you at a disadvantage, compared to just letting each character use their own skills. However, do note that if you hit a weakness with a Synergy skill, it will only consume half turn icons. That is to say, you’ll still get that extra turn with potentially no downside depending on how your party is equipped. If you know a Synergy skill will seriously help you out for any reason, it’s worth the effort to rethink your whole team just to use it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c208b65ab77a2de4a468dd3329b76c2a" data-recommend-id="image://c208b65ab77a2de4a468dd3329b76c2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A menu screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that shows the character Strohl has mastered the Seeker Archetype.

These increases might not individually make a huge impact on your team’s performance, but they do add up as you continue to max out each Archetype.</p><p>If you continue to use an Archetype even after hitting its respective level cap, you’ll instead earn items that boost the EXP of other Archetypes. This is a great mechanic, since you won’t be “punished” for continuing to use your favorite Archetypes. At the same time, the game couldn’t be nudging you any harder to start building different Archetypes once you get to this point. You’re literally wasting those items if you don’t!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-recommend-id="image://4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-recommend-id="image://4fbf7e8e19a8c83ee5e81a00e163e98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A battle screen in Metaphor: ReFantazio that depicts a knight in heavy armor slashing a minotaur with a large sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Having said all of that, <strong>I’m not going to pretend that every Archetype is completely equal</strong>. You’ll typically need to use a Mage more often than a Merchant, for instance. But even then, Merchants get skills that can debilitate Mimics, and they can learn some valuable passive skills that other Archetypes can inherit. How you’ll fit niches like these into your party is up to you.</p><p>Generally speaking, you’ll often want to run a combination of a physical attacker, magical attacker, healer, and supporter in your party. Because of this, each member of your party should focus on the Archetypes that will help them best serve the role they most often fill. Don’t get me wrong, you’ll still encounter situations where turning your entire party into Healers is your best play. But at the very least, thinking about how your team generally performs will at least save you from needing to level grind because you didn’t realize you’d need someone who can use physical attacks.</p><p>As time goes on, I’m sure the greater video game community will figure out which Archetypes in <em>Metaphor</em> are mathematically the best for each encounter. Heck, that’s the very foundation that speedruns are based on, and I can’t wait to see the first person who can beat this thing in under six hours. But with how much <em>Metaphor</em> continuously rewards you for playing with its class system, the gap between optimal play and casual experimentation isn’t quite as vast as you might think. So get out there, have fun <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-sword-skate-fast-travel-map-1851668165">skateboarding on your sword</a></span>, or else the Mega Man in my dreams is going to chastise me about giving ineffective advice on the internet again. Don’t give me that look.</p><hr></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Team17 and developer Sassy Chap Games have announced that&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed to next year, but I think you'll like the new release date (if not the delay itself).</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now launch on February 14th. That's right; what better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than to shack up with a sentient vacuum cleaner or the very air you're breathing?</p>
<p>The game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim">announced in July this year</a>, was originally intended to launch later this month. In the new release date trailer released earlier today, Sassy Chap says that while the game is content complete, some work still needs to be done before&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is ready for release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-delayed-reggie.jpg?itok=vM7ulaH- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-delayed-reggie.jpg?itok=Mssz9Bbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>now lands, appropriately enough, on Valentine's Day.</figcaption></figure><p>That work includes "polish[ing] and perfect[ing] the 3D space", where Sassy Chap says "you're gonna be spending a lot of time".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The QA team is also "hard at work testing thousands of variations and squashing bugs", Sassy Chap says, and there's still a fair way to go until that's done.</p>
<p>As such, Sassy Chap says, due to players' overwhelming support and "benevolent publishers" Team17 (although I'm sure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-employees-allege-harassment-terrible-pay-and-more">some staff would disagree with that assessment</a>), a delay was put into place in order to "avoid crunch".</p>
<p>The devs are promising more information as&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>nears completion, so it shouldn't be too much longer until we hear more about the game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, well, the clue's in the name; it's a dating sim that will allow you to date...well, not quite everything, but a lot of different potential romantic partners themed around inanimate objects and even abstract concepts.</p>
<p>Dateable characters include your bed, your smoke alarm, your vacuum cleaner, and, uh, the concept of an overwhelming sense of existential dread. I can't say I've ever wanted to romance that particular crippling fear, but there we are.</p>
<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

            <p>Fire up the Steam page for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, one of my favourite space sims, and you will see 28 pieces of DLC, ranging from free character portraits to £35 expansion passes that span a bunch of species and story packs. Stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis 4</a> has 37 DLC packs under its banner, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities Skylines</a> is streets ahead with a whopping 62. Paradox Interactive have long built their core game business around putative forever-projects that trail an enormous mantle of paid expansions. It's seemingly this, as much as their institutional expertise with 4X, that justifies their commitment to grand strategy games, whose worlds and systems can be fleshed out for literal decades. </p><!--more-->
<p>One drawback of this approach is that Paradox may at least <em>appear</em> to be deliberately withholding features in order to sell expansions down the road. It's certainly a fair conclusion to make when said DLC expansions are later <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-iv-is-folding-four-of-its-dozens-of-dlcs-into-the-base-game">folded back into the base game</a>, which implies that they should have been there to start with. Pretty much every Paradox game I know of has a vociferous group of players who accuse the company of releasing games that must be "fixed with paid DLC". This is especially true of sequels, which inevitably look skinny and malnourished next to their much-expanded and updated predecessors. At the company's Media Day last week, I asked deputy CEO Mathias Lilja how exactly the company assign resources between main game and DLC development, and how they address the perception of "fixing with DLC" - especially given their more recent experiments with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-experimenting-with-a-subscription-service-to-play-europa-universalis-iv-and-its-dlc">subscription models</a>, which arguably bake in the practice of holding material back.</p>
<p>Lilja began by making what struck me as a slightly unhelpful comparison with painting, designed, I think, to illustrate that game development is a messy, open-ended process. "I think that's one of the things that we're trying to do - to address that [perception]," he said. "The reason that our business is sustainable is that we launch a game, that is good enough. But, like a painting - when is a painting done? When you stop painting it, I guess. Game development is quite a lot the same." </p>
<p>More intelligibly, Lilja suggested that Paradox's developers have long had a kind of unspoken agreement with dedicated players that they will build a business around DLC without taking the piss. "That's the deal we have with our fans - we will continue to develop these games as long as you play it, and we can sell DLC. That's our sustainable business, and that's how we get these games that live for - [in the case of] Europa Universalis 4, it's about 10 years now. It's now called Early Access, but we did that earlier and we didn't call it that. We developed as far as we thought would [make for] a good game. And if we have fans that want it, they will play it, and then we can continue to build on it." </p><p>Lilja thinks that "expectations are higher" today with regard to how much goes into the base game - a continuation of sentiments from earlier in the interview about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">how "accepting" players are that technical problems will be fixed after launch</a>. But he still thinks Paradox are walking the line well enough. "If you look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>, it was a really solid game at launch and it now has DLC," he said. "But we also offer another subscription model, so people can come in and at least try content without having to invest as heavily. And some stay in the subscription model, some convert to DLC, when they've had a chance to feel around. So we try to find ways for people to not have to say 'yes, all in' or 'no, never' but to find a middle ground."</p>
<p>Lilja also shared a little about how exactly Paradox first-party divide their resources between developing for the base game and for post-release expansions, including some thoughts on when and where the developers may have gotten the ratio wrong. "We build games of systems - it's a system of systems, that's mostly what our games are," he said. "Not all systems are created equal. So the question is, what systems are core to this game. The experience of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron 4</a> - what is the most important system to have fully fleshed-out to make it a good game, that has to be there? But maybe we don't do everything because again, we would never be done." </p>
<p>"When we fail, it looks something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a>," he went on. "People wanted more warfare. It existed in the game, but it was barebones - you could go to war, but maybe that was not the [focus]. So you had other things, diplomacy, economics, building your country, whatever. But people wanted the warfare. So there we maybe missed it a bit. Maybe we should have focused on that, because that was part of the fantasy that people wanted in this game." Paradox are still "catching up" with Victoria 3, he added. </p>
<p>What does this division of labour and resources translate to in hard numbers, I asked? How do Paradox allocate time between the launch game and post-release development? It's obviously quite a broad question - different projects have different ins and outs, and Lilja didn't give me a very granular answer. But he did estimate that, right now, a Paradox grand strategy game might take around five years to make, versus around a year for a larger paid expansion. </p><p>"Five years to make, depending on the length of the concept phase, which can be quite long as well, and then a DLC takes maybe a year," he said. "So it could be five to one, for the base game versus the first big DLC expansion. We can do smaller content, but it's very clear that people prefer the bigger DLCs. That's what people like - the smaller content pieces are maybe nice to have, but it's the bigger pieces."</p>
<p>The picture is always shifting, however. Echoing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-says-almost-all-games-should-cost-more-at-a-base-level-because-they-cost-so-much-to-make">other industry executives</a>, Lilja observed that development costs have gone up dramatically over the past decade. "Generally speaking, the requirements on games, have grown over time," he noted. "People get accustomed to a certain standard, I guess. And they expect that or better. So team sizes over time have grown quite a lot. I think generally that is also part of the problem, right now in the games industry, that teams are huge. Our teams aren't huge, but they're way bigger now than they were a couple of years ago, or 10 years ago. It's a big difference." </p>
<p>Paradox's team sizes have expanded partly because they want their grand strategy games to reach players who might find grand strategy absolutely impenetrable. "We want our games to be more accessible, so we need to focus more on that than just the core features - we need to build out around these things," Lilja said. "But it also means that every piece of content we make becomes more expensive." </p>
<p>The unspoken context here, of course, is that Paradox have been doing a lot of cost-cutting over the past two years, closing studios, cancelling games and laying people off. This seemingly has less to do with the publisher's tentpole grand strategy business than with their outside bets on new genres, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">XCOM-style turn-based tactics games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">life sims</a>. But Paradox's grand strategy forever-games haven't all escaped the guillotine: the publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradoxs-grand-strategy-star-trek-infinite-will-receive-no-further-updates">stopped supporting updates</a> for Nimble Giant's unfortunately titled Star Trek: Infinite the year after launch.</p><p>I spoke to Paradox's chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus after my chat with Lilja. He had less patience for the charge of "fixing games with DLC", arguing that Paradox have a decent track record for overhauling and adding to their games at no further cost. "That's the negative way of looking at it," he told me. "This game will live for a long time and even if I don't buy anything, it's going to keep getting better, right? That's what we're after." </p>
<p>Fåhraeus did caveat that Paradox have gotten a little "lost" recently with regard to their paid DLC strategy. But he also told me that you can't please everyone. "Since this is subjective, there will always be people who think that every game is incomplete, when we release it, and that it needs more of something," he said. "So there's no getting around that, but what we can do is do our utmost to ensure that it feels like a really good game, that the quality is high and that it meets player expectations. What do players expect? Quality."</p>
<p>This news piece is the fourth in what I would have branded the Paradox Files, if the conversations were slightly juicier, or if I had slightly less shame. Elsewhen at the same event, Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">aired his current expectations for the much-delayed and shuffled-around Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which increasingly feels like it should be called something else. He and Fåhraeus also talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">what went wrong with Life By You, and why they're still keen to publish a Paradox life sim</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, Bandai Namco’s latest 3D fighter, is now available on all platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC. One of the game’s new features is Episode Battles, where players experience the iconic canon storyline of popular anime series and explore alternative futures depending on their choices. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles Guide will explore all branching storylines for Goku in the Saiyan Saga.</p>



<p>To explore these new paths in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode battles, players must achieve specific goals during their battles. Additionally, you receive 100,000 Zeni and a bunch of XP every time you complete a branching episode in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. In this guide, we will explore all the different paths you can take for Goku in the Saiyan Saga and what conditions you must meet to get these paths.</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-attack-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Attack Guide</a></p>



<h2 id="h-canon-story-line">Canon Story Line</h2>



<p>To explore the canon storyline for Goku, players must make choices that match the ones made in the anime. The first choice arrives right after Raditz kidnaps Gohan, and Piccolo offers to help Goku. Here, you must accept Piccolo’s help to follow the original story. This path will lead to Goku and Piccolo confronting Raditz. If you are unable to defeat him before Piccolo intervenes, the story will follow the original events, with Goku sacrificing himself to get rid of Raditz. The last battles will be between Nappa and Vegeta, and these will go down as they did in the anime.</p>

<h2 id="h-pushing-the-limit">Pushing the Limit</h2>



<p>This is the first branching path for Goku in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles. To follow this path, you must still accept Piccolo’s help fighting against Raditz. However, you must defeat Raditz as Goku before Piccolo intervenes to open the alternate route. On this path, Goku survives his battle with Raditz and trains with the Z Warriors ahead of Nappa and Vegeta’s arrival. This is all you need to do to explore the branching path.</p>



<p><strong>Spoilers ahead in the following paragraphs for players who want to explore this path independently. Skip to <em>Side by Side</em> to learn about the next path in Goku’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles.</strong></p>



<p>Once they arrive, Goku can overturn another iconic canon event and save Yamcha from the Saibamen ambush. The following events are similar to the canon story. However, the ending is a bit different. The Saiyan invaders beat Goku, and the Z-Warriors must enter the battle. Chiatzou looks for a Sensu Bean to heal Goku.</p>

<h3 id="h-enraged-goku">Enraged Goku</h3>



<p>Goku manages to heal with that Sensu Bean. However, it is too late as most of the Z Warriors are defeated, and Piccolo falls in battle against Great Ape Vegeta. Looking at the state of his friends, Goku is enraged and transforms into a Super Saiyan. He destroys the fake moon and completely demolishes Vegeta; however, he still allows him to escape Earth.</p>



<p>Goku then travels to Namek to revive his friends with the Namekian Dragon Balls but is faced with Frieze’s Forces. He defeats some of them only to realise that Frieza has already been killed, and the deed was done by Vegeta, who has also learned the Super Saiyan transformation. Both characters then duke it out one last time in their Super Saiyan forms; Goku wins the battle and lets Vegeta survive, stating that he wants to fight him again.</p>

<h2 id="h-side-by-side">Side by Side</h2>



<p>This is the other alternate path in Goku’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles. To follow this path, you must reject Piccolo’s help after Gohan is kidnapped and confront Raditz with the Turtle School. You must quickly bring Raditz’s health down in this battle before Krillin intervenes.</p>



<p>This is the only task you need to complete to explore this path; however, if you don’t bring Raditz’s health down in time, you will be returned to the canon storyline. If you manage to bring his health down, Raditz is defeated again, Goku survives the battle, and the alternate path is opened.</p>



<p><strong>Again, spoilers are ahead for players who want to explore this section independently.</strong></p>



<p>Goku trains with the Z-Warriors and understands the value of teamwork, while Piccolo proposes to train Gohan in the meantime, seeing the kid’s immense potential. Vegeta and Nappa arrive on Earth as they do in the canon storyline but are faced with Rivals who have turned into Allies: Goku, Piccolo, and Tien. The trio somehow manages to bring Vegeta and Nappa down, but Goku dies in the process; however, his last wish is to let Vegeta escape.</p>

<h3 id="h-vegeta-s-unbelievable-counter-offer">Vegeta’s Unbelievable Counter Offer</h3>



<p>Some time passes by, and the Earth’s Dragon Balls revive Goku. Surprisingly, Vegeta returns to Earth, demanding the Dragon Balls make himself immortal to fight against Frieza. Goku denies his request, and Vegeta offers a counteroffer that no one would expect. He asks to team up with Goku to fight against Frieza.</p>



<p>Goku and Vegeta start training together, waiting for Frieza’s arrival on Earth instead of Namek. They then take on the entire Ginyu force. Here, another unique event occurs, where Captain Ginyu takes over Vegeta’s body instead of Goku’s, which is a hilarious exchange between the characters.</p>

<h3 id="h-dream-team">Dream Team</h3>



<p>Vegeta recovered his body and, along with Goku, took the battle to Frieza. Frieza boasts multiple transformations and proves himself to be a formidable opponent for the duo. However, Vegeta and Goku overcame him with teamwork and the all-mighty Spirit Bomb. Right after Frieza is defeated, Goku and Vegeta go their separate ways, vowing to fight each other again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-becomes-million-seller-on-launch-day/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio has just launched<span>, and Atlus has already&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/stud_zero/status/1844665951431930116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that</a> its cumulative global sales have surpassed one million units. Even <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2679460/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, it's making record numbers compared to the Persona franchise when it comes to concurrent users. It's certainly a great result for a new IP, even though the Persona team had many</span>&nbsp;long-standing fans who were looking forward to playing this new title.</p>
<p>In this fantasy world, the protagonist (Will) travels with his fairy companion, Gallica, to lift the curse from the kingdom's lost prince. Players may awaken the magical "Archetype" powers that lie dormant within their character's heart; awakening to an Archetype unlocks the power to channel and combine the abilities of unique professions. Throughout the adventure, they will strengthen their bonds and level up their party to defeat mighty foes and discover the true nature of the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Wccftech's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, Kai Tatsumoto rated Metaphor: ReFantazio 9/10, although he noted it's essentially Persona 6 in all but name:</p>
<p><em>No matter how much I engaged with the core fundamentals of Metaphor: ReFantazio, I couldn’t escape the feeling that this was largely Persona 6 by another name rather than some new IP that could stand on its own merits. That isn’t to say that Hashino’s team hasn’t created another stylish JRPG with broad appeal, but the premise that Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy is dead. If the Persona series left you wanting more, Metaphor: ReFantazio certainly is a tale worth experiencing for yourself.</em></p>
<p>The Atlus team feels a bit different, however. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoG2zH-Pl6o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, Director Katsura Hashino explained how this new game is a departure from the Persona franchise:</p>
<p><em>We really had ideas that we wanted to put in this game that we couldn't put into other games. For example, the Persona series is set in the real world. That means the story we want to tell becomes slightly limited to the place that we're building the story within.</em></p>
<p><em>It also means it's a little bit easier for us to work with because we know the place, we have that baseline to work from. But once again, it does limit our options. Whereas in an entirely new fantasy world that we create, we have the freedom to explore all these ideas and things that we weren't able to do in the past. In the Persona series, the story itself is based around a single location where all the characters hang out. The world that they're living in doesn't change, but the way that they perceive it changes.&nbsp; </em><em>That's one of the major parts of the Persona series that's really interesting in its own way. </em></p>
<p><em>But in Metaphor: ReFantazio, we don't really have that one place where everybody is based out of. We don't have that single location to work with. In a way, we do have one country that the characters are traveling through, so they do have that connection to a country instead of a specific place. But the scale is much larger, so you get the chance to see a broader perspective.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-to-make-games-playable-and-purchasable-via-android-app-in-november.1007145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that come November, you'll be able to buy and play Xbox games directly within the Android app thanks to a recent court ruling against Android owner Google.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Xbox president Sarah Bond says that a recent court decision ruling that Google <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store">must open up its Play Store</a> to third-party apps will "allow more choice and flexibility".</p>
<p>The ruling came as part of a lawsuit brought by Epic against Google, with the former alleging that the latter's dominance of the mobile sphere (alongside that of Apple, against whom Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-apple-lawsuit-escalates-as-developer-accounts-are-terminated">also brought a lawsuit</a>) constitutes an illegal monopoly, a position with which the court clearly agreed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-app-android-purchases-store.jpg?itok=1dDkHXC0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-app-android-purchases-store.jpg?itok=lBk_0oKE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to buy games directly from the Xbox app.</figcaption></figure><p>Bond says the decision to incorporate purchases directly into the Xbox Android app is born of Xbox's mission to "allow more players to play on more devices".</p>
<p>Right now, there's no news on whether or not this will be possible on the Apple App Store version of the app; Bond only mentions Android, and since Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24158911/apple-v-epic-evidentiary-hearing-app-store-payments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wasn't ordered by courts</a> to open up its App Store to third-party storefronts, the iOS situation is unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>
<p>The Epic-Google situation began back in 2020, when Epic decided to allow players to purchase&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s V-Bucks currency on mobile using a proprietary payment method instead of going through Apple and Google's respective payment processes.</p>
<p>This prompted both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store">Google</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines">Apple</a> to remove the game from their mobile storefronts, a decision over which Epic quickly sued both companies, hoping to prove that Google and Apple's mobile dominance constituted a duopoly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-games-store-mobile.jpg?itok=yW-O6qeM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-games-store-mobile.jpg?itok=Qtm86sb5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft is benefiting from a court decision made in Epic's favor.</figcaption></figure><p>In 2020, close to when Epic first filed both of its lawsuits, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-files-statement-in-support-of-epic-against-apple">filed a statement in favor</a> of the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer, although said statement was in support of an injunction adjacent to the case rather than the main lawsuit itself.</p>
<p>It looks like Epic has arguably repaid Microsoft in kind for that support today, whether it intended to or not. You'll be able to buy and play Xbox games directly through the Xbox Android app starting in November this year, although we don't have a concrete date for that change yet.</p>

    <p><span>Journey back to Penacony and visit the prestigious Paperfold University.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Annals of Pinecany’s Mappou Age,” will launch on October 23, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-920793"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update will take Trailblazers to Penacony’s prestigious Paperfold University, which is buzzing with excitement for a new semester and its anniversary celebrations. Players will also get their hands on the newest 5-star character, Rappa, a daring Galaxy Ranger. On top of that, the highly anticipated Simulated Universe DLC will also receive a massive and thrilling update.</p><p>As the recent Xianzhou adventure concludes, players will journey back to Penacony and visit its Paperfold University, a prestigious cosmic institution bustling with activity as it prepares for a new semester and its anniversary celebrations. The campus is alive with clubs recruiting new members, and music performances fill the air. For this special occasion, the university is hosting an exclusive academic seminar, and as notable figures and stakeholders in Penacony, the crew of the Astral Express has been invited as distinguished guests to partake in the festivities. In the Version 2.6 Trailblaze Continuance mission, Banana Outrage: Battles Without Ninja and Humanity, the Trailblazer will step into Paperfold University as an auditing student, fully immersing in the joys of campus life. Alongside peers like March 7th and Dan Heng, Trailblazers will not only delve into the rigors of academic pursuits but also cultivate meaningful relationships, enriching this one-of-a-kind scholastic adventure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_920794"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As Trailblazers immerse themselves in campus life, they’ll be able to meet a powerful new 5-star ally—Rappa, a courageous and unique character ready to join the battlefield. Rappa calls herself a ninja, attributing everything to the art of “ninjutsu.” Rappa recites ninja mantras, creates Dazzling Ninja Seals, and follows the Way of the Ninja through ninja scrolls, blending rap, graffiti, and comics. With strict self-discipline, she travels the stars upholding justice. As a Galaxy Ranger, Rappa is on a relentless mission to hunt down her nemesis, Evil Ninja Osaru, across the Cosmos. In battle, after unleashing her Ultimate, she will enter Sealform and unleash Ningu: Demonbane Petalblade in a special first-person view. During the attacks of Ningu: Demonbane Petalblade, Rappa is able to deal damage to groups of enemies efficiently, and can even reduce the Toughness of enemies without Imaginary Weakness. This version will bring a wave of exciting events. In “Sound Hunt Ninjutsu Inscription,” Trailblazers will be invited as a guest and step in as the band manager for the Dreamlight Anniversary music party, teaming up with Rappa and leading the band’s electrifying performances in the music party.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>That aside, the limited 5-star characters Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae, Acheron, and Aventurine will make their return to the first and second halves of the Version 2.6 warp event, respectively. Their formidable support ensures they will remain powerful allies in your future adventures.</p><p>Meanwhile, Version 2.6 will introduce the much-anticipated third Simulated Universe DLC, following Swarm Disaster and Gold and Gears. This time, a massive void, the Unknowable Domain, has emerged within the Simulated Universe. It was initially simulating the Scholars’ Strife, a post-Second Emperor’s War event where scholarly factions battled for control of Emperor Rubert II’s legacy—the Scepter system. The Scepter, a cluster of inorganic bionic neurons, served as Rubert II’s external thinking unit with immense processing power. In this Simulated Universe update, Trailblazers will start by collecting Scepters and enhancing them with Components to strengthen their abilities. As the game progresses, players can strategically combine multiple Scepters and Components to unlock powerful synergies, eventually defeating a formidable final foe.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,145 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

                <p>In response to a recent court ruling, Microsoft has announced that Xbox fans will soon be able to purchase and play Xbox games directly from the Xbox app on Android.</p><p>A judge ruled in the Epic v.

This effort, spearheaded by Epic's Tim Sweeney, means Microsoft will sell Xbox games directly to consumers beginning November 1.</p><p>The Fortnite studio convinced the court that Google made it very difficult for any rival store within Google Play to successfully compete in the market, and that's led to this decision being handed down.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/11/what-we-played-metaphor-refantazio-until-dawn-cyberpunk-2077/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s definitely been feeling chillier this past few days, which is handy if you needed an excuse to turn your beefy gaming PC on to heat up the room a bit. My gaming has generally been much lower-powered, with Super Mario Party Jamboree on the go for review, and a preview of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/mario-luigi-brothership-preview/">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>, but I did enjoy a little time with Until Dawn over the weekend, and I might fire up the PC this coming weekend for something a little toastier.</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has continued to play <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, delivering our review at the start of the week, “but I’ll just add this,” he says. “If there’s any scousers out there wondering where their representation was, whe ghot yhahhh!”</p>

<p>Working on a very different review has been <strong>Steve</strong>, whose week has been all about Silent Hill 2, “which is a superb updating of a true classic.” Expect to actually see our review of it sometime soon, but he’s also checked out a few early demos ahead of the next Steam Next Fest, which is coming next week… next.</p>
<p>After deciding that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/undisputed-review/">Undisputed</a> wasn’t enough pugilistic fun, <strong>Aran’s</strong> treated himself to Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. He’s also been playing Final Fantasy XVI and is at the stage where he’s done most of the hunts and is getting closer to the end of the game’s story.</p>


<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> been on his e-bike, as it were, for our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/parcel-corps-review/">Parcel Corps</a>. He’s also slipped back into Cyberpunk 2077. “I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve peeled back enough layers of Night City to realise I should be focusing on the main story and I’m determined to see the credits roll by the end of 2024. That would mean I’ve put a cross through Skyrim, New Vegas, and Cyberpunk – the 3 biggest games on my backlog.”</p>
<p>And then he’s loaded up Jade Empire on Steam Deck for something rather different.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> also has been playing the talking simulator that is the opening hours of Cyberpunk 2077 – “OMG SHUT UP AND LET ME PLAY THE F-ING GAME. WHY DO YOU TALK SO MUCH. OH YAY ANOTHER RIDE IN A CAR WHILE SOMEONE TALKS AT ME!” – and I don’t think he’ll be going back anytime soon. So it’s been Destiny 2 and our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/">review of Until Dawn</a> for the rest of the week.</p>

<p>You just can’t keep <strong>Ade</strong> away from those sea shanties, as he’s been sailing the seas of Skull and Bones once again. “Season 3 has proven something of a game changer, with the game finally getting out of the way of itself and letting player’s play. If Ubisoft had launched with the game in this form it may have benefited from a more positive reception. Still, glad they are sticking with it.”</p>
<p>He’s also been helping out his son with Mario Odyssey as Cappy, and started a playthrough of Until Dawn with his partner.</p>
<p>Rounding out the week, <strong>Dom</strong> has had his usual bouts of Overwatch 2, but complimented that PvP staple with his own first few steps into the world of Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-upgrading-rtx3060-to-4070/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Upgrading from the base model to the PlayStation 5 Pro feels like upgrading from an RTX 3060 or 3060 Ti to an RTX 4070 GPU, allowing users to access visual features that were previously not available.</p>
<p>In a video shared recently on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">YouTube</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry talked about the upcoming mid-generation system from Sony after having had the chance to go hands-on with it, saying that in games like F1 24, where the developer put plenty of effort into the PS5 Pro update, upgrading from the base model feels indeed like upgrading the GPU in a gaming system. Even in other scenarios where the visual improvements aren't as massive, the PlayStation 5 Pro is definitely worth it for those players who play demanding console games in Performance Mode and wish to experience much better visual quality. On the other hand, the system doesn't offer a whole lot in terms of visual improvements over the base model's Quality mode, whose image quality is still fine at 4K resolution and standard viewing distance, although the system's better ray tracing capabilities could be enticing even for this category of players as well.</p>
<p>As such, even at its high price, the PlayStation 5 Pro can definitely be worth it. While there is an argument to be made about the console's price versus the price of a gaming PC with similar specs, the Sony console offers a completely hassle-free experience compared to a PC.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also highlighted how important the introduction of the PlayStation 5 Pro's PSSR upscaler is. The upscaler not only makes the system a more significant upgrade than what the specs suggest, but it can also be used to improve the visual quality of ray tracing, although not in the same way as DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction does, as Sony's upscaler cannot separate all inputs from the final color value of a scene like the NVIDIA technology does.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Hands-On Verdict: Is The Upgrade Worth The Price?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zvZloAl3kE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take much longer for players to see for themselves if the PlayStation 5 Pro is a worthy upgrade over the base model. The console launches in less than a month, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

That figure will no-doubt rise as we head into the weekend and fans in other regions get the chance to play.</p><p>The game also launched across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, but neither Sony nor Microsoft makes player numbers publicly available. It seems likely that one million sales figure will swell to two million sooner rather than later.</p><p>Atlus made the announcement alongside the release of an illustration from character designer Shigenori Soejima, below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>アトラス完全新作ファンタジーRPG『メタファー：リファンタジオ』 全世界累計販売本数100万本を突破！</p><p>"Metaphor: ReFantazio" has surpassed 1 million copies sold worldwide!</p><p>MetacriticによるメタスコアではPlayStation®5版:93点をはじめ各プラットフォームで高得点を獲得しました。 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#メタファー</a> <a href="https://t.co/ruL9vpNxOT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ruL9vpNxOT</a></p></div>— セガ公式アカウント🦔 (@SEGA_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1844668055080910999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Metaphor: ReFantazio, from the creators of the hugely popular Persona 3, 4, and 5, is a role-playing game set in the United Kingdom of Euchronia, a medieval fantasy realm that mirrors the real world.

We said: “Refining the Atlus RPG formula of weaving tough turn-based combat into compelling social sim mechanics, Metaphor: ReFantazio doesn’t just send a powerful message across its political drama, it becomes a beautiful expression of the real impact storytelling can have on all of us.”</p><p>As part of its promotion for the game’s launch, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-competition-gives-metaphor-refantazio-fan-a-real-royal-title-hand-to-the-sovereign-prince-of-sealand">Sega gave UK fans the chance to become a member of the royal family of the world's smallest (but unofficially recognized) country: Sealand</a>.</p><p>If you're jumping into Metaphor: ReFantazio, here's <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metaphor-refantazio/How_to_Pick_Starting_Stats_(Guard_Interview_Answers)">how to pick your starting stats</a>, plus <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metaphor-refantazio/Things_We_Wish_We_Knew_Sooner">Metaphor tips we wish we knew sooner</a>.

Others have wondered whether it might have something to do with Nintendo Switch Online retro games, such as the release of GameCube games on the service.</p><p>Crucially, Nintendo appears to want playtesters to play docked and with a strong internet connection, which has sparked speculation that Nintendo is testing a cloud-based streaming service for Switch games, similar to the kind offered by Xbox, PlayStation, and Nvidia.</p><p>The big question, of course, is whether this test has something to do with the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">Switch 2</a>, which Nintendo has yet to formally announce. The official Nintendo playtest page mentions more information will be revealed on October 20, which fans have already said lines up with the anniversary of the original Switch reveal (October 20, 2016).</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>This documentary is Grand Theft Hamlet, and tells the story of two unemployed actors who went about staging a performance of Shakespeare's tragedy within GTA Online. It was directed by Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane. </p>
<p>
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy," Hamlet says to Horatio in the play, and while he probably wasn't chatting about video games, I feel this quote still fits here.

<p>Grand Theft Hamlet  was recorded during the Covid lockdown, and had its premiere at SXSW - a film and media festival held in America - earlier this year, where it won the Documentary Feature Jury Award. The documentary will be getting its UK premiere during the BFI London Film Festival later this month, however <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=grand-theft-hamlet-lff24&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=">all screenings are sold out</a>.</p>
<p>The full synopsis for the Grand Theft Hamlet, via <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/03/grand-theft-hamlet-altitude-actors-production-inside-gta-1235850197/">Deadline</a>, reads:</p>
<p>"January 2021. The UK is in its third lockdown and all entertainment venues remain closed. For theatre actors Sam and Mark, the future looks bleak. As the pandemic drags on, Mark - single and childless - is increasingly socially isolated, while Sam panics about how he is going to support his young family. They spend their days in the online digital world of Grand Theft Auto and when they stumble across a theatre, they suddenly have an idea to stage a full production of Hamlet within the game.</p>
<p>"This film charts their ridiculous, hilarious and moving adventure as they battle violent griefers and discover surprising truths about life, friendship and the enduring power of Shakespeare."</p>

<p>Reviews for Grand Theft Hamlet have praised the documentary. "This is an irreplicable experience that speaks volumes about following your dreams despite the challenges that await," wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-hamlet-review">IGN</a> following its SXSW screening.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/grand-theft-hamlet-review-1235936982/">Variety</a> called the documentary a "captivating staging of Shakespeare" which "changes the game", while <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/grand-theft-hamlet-review-1235846517/">Hollywood Reporter</a> said Grand Theft Hamlet was "innovative, highly amusing and often touching".</p>
<p>Grand Theft Hamlet will receive a wider release early next year. Further details will be announced "soon".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/metaphor-refantazio-how-to-restore-and-manage-mp-to-explore-dungeons-for-longer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like in the latest few entries in the Persona series, MP management, and restoration in Metaphor: ReFantazio is extremely important. Unlike other Japanese role-playing games, MP restoration items are hard to come by, so you need to be extremely mindful of when to use your Skills so as not to find yourself out of MP before a battle against a powerful enemy or boss which would force you to leave the dungeon and waste a precious day that could have been used to strengthen the bonds with your Followers or improve one of your Kingly Virtues.</p>
<p>The first tip that can improve your MP management in Metaphor: ReFantazio may sound a little obvious, but it's very easy to forget in the heat of things. <strong>You don't have to fight every enemy you meet inside dungeons</strong>. Experience points gain falls off pretty quickly if you're fighting enemies at around your own level, so there's no risk of being underleveled for certain battles if you fight the right amount of enemies. The only reason some players may have to fight every single enemy inside a dungeon is to gain Archetype Experience to unlock more Skills and better customization options, but Archetype Experience points gain falls off as quickly as regular Experience points do, and there are way better ways to earn A-EXP, such as using the Hero family of items that can be obtained in a lot of different ways. So, no matter how you want to play the game, <strong>always pick your battles carefully.</strong></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241009141742_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the start of Metaphor: ReFantazio, using items such as Magla Pills and Potions will be the only way to restore MP while inside dungeons, but thankfully, way more options become available as the adventure proceeds, and using them accordingly will allow you to grind for EXP and A-EXP if needed, or simply explore the biggest dungeons fully in a single day. The first of these options becomes available fairly early in the game but is limited to the Main Character. Every Archetype belonging to the Mage Lineage comes with a Hero Passive skill called <strong>Magic Recovery</strong> <strong>which recovers MP each time an enemy is stunned or defeated in overworld combat.</strong> As enemies that require Squad combat to be defeated can be stunned over and over in the field, this skill provides a potentially unlimited MP reserve for the Main Character, although MP recovery with this skill is very slow and is mostly useful as a last resort.</p>
<p>Another solid method to restore MP in Metaphor: ReFantazio can be unlocked after Heismay joins the Main Character in his quest. The Thief Archetype he embodies can learn the<strong> Plunder Magic skill, which restores a small amount of MP</strong> by consuming one to activate the skill. Thanks to the Inheritance system, this skill can be assigned to any Archetype. Enter a Squad battle, defeat every enemy but one, and use Plunder Magic repeatedly to restore MP. If the enemy is susceptible to Sleep, you can do so without having to worry about healing.</p>
<p>Once you unlock the Masked Dancer Archetype, the strategy above becomes even more effective with the<strong> Masked Revelry passive skill, which recovers a medium amount of the caster's MP every turn, with increased recovery if more Archetypes of the same Lineage are present in the battle party</strong>, so, if you have enough Magla to unlock the Archetype for all your party members, you can restore a decent chunk of MP by just having them participate in battle. Unfortunately, the Masked Dancer is among the last few Archetypes you unlock, so you will have to make do with other MP recovery strategies before you can use this one. By strengthening the bond with the Follower that grants access to this archetype to Rank 2, you will also be able to enjoy some light MP restoration after battle thanks to the Triumphant Hymn ability.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241009140351_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Equipping the right accessories is also a great way to restore MP in Metaphor: ReFantazio. Items like the <strong>Crescent Medal</strong> provide moderate MP restoration every turn, and they are a great pick for Archetypes that need a lot of MP to deal damage or provide support, such as the Mage and Commander Lineages. The <strong>Full Moon Medal</strong>, which can be obtained as a reward for the Silver I league at the Brilehaven Colosseum, provides even better MP recovery.</p>
<p>In case all the methods above are too slow, you can always fall back on items. MP recovery items can be found in a lot of different places, and you can even get some for free on some days with the Bardon's Care Package ability. After a certain point in the game, you can also cook <strong>Magical Bread</strong>, which grants gradual MP recovery while walking in dungeons for 60 seconds, which works great as emergency MP restoration.</p>

            <p>You have woken to the sound of multiple former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers arguing inside your own skull. They are bickering about whose game is the true spiritual successor to the rockbottom detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Is it the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">unnamed project announced earlier today</a> by new studio Longdue, involving some kind of "psychogeography mechanic"? Or is it this one, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>, a cerebral sci-fi RPG set in a posh polar hotel about a detective "solving gruesome murders, breaking sacred hearts, or just killing bloody time"? It's not for me to choose the dialogue option now appearing in your own brain. But I will say this: at least the one with the horny name has a trailer.</p>

<p>Ah, sultry whispering. Yes, this basically seems like an ASMR rework of the waking scene in Disco Elysium, in which detective Harry DuBois wakes up slowly to the quarreling sounds of his limbic system and a sense of deep worthlessness. </p>
<p>But here you'll play a detective on holiday at an Antarctic ski resort in the year 2086, where something has gone wrong. "Now you’re stranded at the off-season resort with unforgettable guests, wild parties, and mad secrets," say developers Dark Math Games. </p><p>There will be a similar crowd of dialogue-heavy skills that influence your choices, by the looks of things, along with skill checks and the like. Your character will be putting her training to use with "interrogations, confrontations, and seductions". The sexy wording continues. "In the endless polar night, amidst the orgies of politics, power, and poetry, something gruesome lies waiting."</p>
<p>There's certainly more than a whiff of Revachol's idiosyncratic lingo to the game's writing so far. "Use Marafet calculations to alter your time and space," we're told. Enjoy the "Dopamine Buffet". There's also the ability to recruit companions to help you solve cases. I'll call it now - you will probably fuck your companions. </p>
<p>ZAUM, the studio that made Disco Elysium, became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">wracked with internal disputes</a> following that game's release, which eventually led to employees leaving the company, including key directors like Robert Kurvitz and Aleksander Rostov. It looks like those two are not involved in either of these new games though. Regardless of who is or isn't working on it, I still think XXX Nightshift is an, uh, <em>interesting</em> name choice. Insofar as I expect to see it written in comic sans on the Steam thumbnail of an ass in a g-string. But hey, you still have time to change your minds, Disco people. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer">It's been done before</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And however much we might grow up and think of ourselves as mature, sober citizens, you can still get a frisson of that pleasure by organizing a closet, or watching a tower block demolished. So why not go the whole hog and indulge that secret pleasure with one of the very best dexterity games on the market?</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best Dexterity Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#junk">Junk Ark</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#nekojima">Nekojima</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#catacombs">Catacombs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#klask">Klask</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#tinderblox">Tinderblox</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#jenga">Jenga</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#crokinole">Crokinole</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#dungeon">Dungeon Fighter</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#jungle">Jungle Speed</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#kabuto">Kabuto Sumo</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#drop">Drop It</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#hamster">Hamster Roll</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#looping">Looping Louie</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games#rhino">Rhino Hero</a></li></ul><h2 id="junk">Junk Art</h2><div id="197672" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Junk Art</h3></p></div><p>Why pick one best dexterity game when you can have them all in a single box? That’s essentially what Junk Art is. The box contains four colored sets of oddly-shaped pieces and a deck of matching cards, alongside another set of cards to determine what mini-games you’re going to play with them. They range from traditional stacking affairs, to co-operative piling, to passing the most awkward pieces to your neighbor and even playing a trick-taking game to get the best pieces. There are additional blank cards to make your own, and an internet full of suggestions. With no two games ever likely to be the same and a range of dexterity and strategic challenges, this could be the only activity game you ever need.</p><p id="nekojima"><h2 data-toc-title="Nekojima" id="nekojima">Nekojima</h2></p><div catalogid="82b1d311-1ea1-49a6-b6f7-7535a9f09273" id="207880"><div id="207880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Nekojima</h3></p></div><p>If you want a stacking game that retains the simple, accessible delights of piling things on top of each other, but want it to look better and play more peculiarly than Jenga, look no further than <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nekojima-board-game-review">Nekojima</a>. Here, you’re piling pairs of poles rather than blocks, but the big catch is that each couplet is connected by a length of stiff cord, which mustn’t touch any other cords or poles once placed. That gives the game a fascinating edge when it comes to calculating how you can help or hinder the following plays. There are also cardboard cats you must occasionally hang from the growing network, following the same no-touch rule. Easily learned, and just as fun whether you’re playing solo, competitively or cooperatively, this is a modern classic for all ages.</p></div><p id="catacombs"><h2 data-toc-title="Catacombs" id="catacombs">Catacombs</h2></p><div catalogid="522975dc-ca51-4f23-8f62-5656d6566f86" id="208972"><div id="208972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Catacombs</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity games tend to be about stacking things, or balancing things or - as in the case of Catacombs - flicking things. But here those simple, accessible delights are used as a base layer on which to paste the additional mechanics of a fantasy adventure game. The board becomes a dungeon room, the heroes and monsters discs that can be flicked for movement, while attacks, spells and missiles are smaller projectiles to bounce around the arena. It’s a brilliant combination, offering a fast-playing quest game with multiple upgrade paths for your heroes and a randomised dungeon each time for huge replay value as well as the huge fun of flicking discs.</p><h2 id="klask">Klask</h2><div id="197673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Klask</h3></p></div><p>Klask is one of those absurdly simple ideas that makes you wonder why no-one thought of it before. Each player controls a piece on the board using a magnet underneath, which they push around to hit a tiny plastic ball careening around the tray-like playing surface. There’s an indent in each end which counts as a goal, and the – ahem – goal is to push that ball into the opponent’s indent while defending your own. There’s a lot of speed and skill to this pursuit, far more than it may initially seem, and that would be enough to win it a space on this list. But the kicker is that the field is also littered with magnetic obstacles that will stick to your paddle if you get too close, upping both the skills and thrills in one fell swoop.</p><h2 id="tinderblox">Tinderblox</h2><div id="197674" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tinderblox</h3></p></div><p>The joy of Tinderblox is its tiny mint-tin scale. Within is a simple yet devious stacking game where you manoeuvre mini-blocks onto a stack of firewood and coloured flame cubes using a pair of supplied tweezers. When it’s your turn, the items you need to add to the pile are dictated by a card draw. Sometimes it’ll be a little stack of its own, a stick and a fire cube, that you must keep balanced as you manoeuvre it into position. Sometimes the card will also tell you to swap hands for added challenge. It’s the stacking game reduced to its absolute bare essentials, put in a super-portable package that you can take anywhere on the off-chance of players, and with bright colors that make it look great on the table even in miniature. Its ongoing appeal is a testament to the basal satisfaction of trying to put things in a nice, even pile.</p><h2 id="jenga">Jenga</h2><div id="197675" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Jenga</h3></p></div><p>This is a game that pretty much everyone is familiar with, but there are a few fascinating facts about Jenga that might make a more interesting pick than you realize. First, despite its ubiquity, this isn’t any kind of ancient classic – it was invented in 1983 by Leslie Scott. Second, her particular innovation, which is common to all branded versions of this venerable stacking game, is that all the blocks are made to be slightly different from each other, creating imperfections that make the behavior of the stack far harder to predict. Factoids that are not only great for dinner parties, but also for getting an edge in the after-dinner games when the stacking blocks come out.</p><p>You can also choose to go with giant Jenga, which is a jumbo-sized version of the original that makes for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-outdoor-yard-games">great yard game</a>.</p><h2 id="crokinole">Crokinole</h2><div id="197676" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Tournament Crokinole &amp; Checkers</h3></p></div><p>If you want a genuinely old dexterity game that still has teeth, look no further than Crokinole. It dates back to at least the mid-1800’s in Canada and is quite possibly older as a folk game. Most boards nowadays are mass-produced, but it’s still possible to buy handmade ones, which will set you back a pretty penny. It’s a flicking game where you’re trying to score by getting your discs as far into the board as possible, particularly the central region which is ringed by pegs. But in order to be valid, your shot must cause at least one opposing disc to move, otherwise it’s removed. This gives the game a strategic edge on top of the considerable flicking chops that it demands, as you’re always trying to clog up your opponent’s opportunities to hit your discs while freeing up your own. </p><h2 id="dungeon">Dungeon Fighter</h2><div id="197677" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dungeon Fighter</h3></p></div><p>There’s a surprising amount of dexterity games that weave in a fantasy or a sci-fi themes, and Dungeon Fighter is the current king of the pile. It’s a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a> where players each have a character in an adventuring party seeking to loot a dangerous dungeon. Whenever you encounter one of the game’s frequent monsters you fight it by throwing dice, as you might expect, but the twist is that you’re rolling onto a target board which will do damage depending on where the dice stops. If it rolls off, or falls into one of the gaps on the board, it’s a duff blow. With plenty of variety in character, dungeon and monster cards and a high skill ceiling, increased by the various bizarre throwing methods mandated by certain monsters, such as flicking dice off the back of your hand, it’s a delightful mix of challenge, narrative and tomfoolery.</p><h2 id="jungle">Jungle Speed</h2><div id="197678" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Jungle Speed</h3></p></div><p>If you’ve ever felt that the beloved children’s classic card game snap was missing a vicious and sometimes bloody edge, then do we have a game for you. The core of the game is just like snap: players turn over cards one at a time and look for matches. But sat in the middle of the table is the sinister, brooding totem, and players with matching cards are instantly catapulted into a race to grab it first. The looser has to take all the played cards so far and, quite probably, nurse any number of bruises, scratches and sprains gained in the struggle for supremacy. Add in a few special-effect cards, including one that has all players grabbing for the totem, and you’ve got a modern classic. Just make sure all the players trim their fingernails first.  </p><h2 id="kabuto">Kabuto Sumo</h2><div id="197679" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kabuto Sumo: Bug Wrestling </h3></p></div><p>There’s a general tendency for dexterity games to revolve around stacking things, or grabbing things or throwing things. But Kabuto Sumo has a whole new take on the genre, inspired by penny waterfall arcade machines. The player’s beetle pieces square off on a platform, surrounded by wooden discs. Then you take turns pushing oddly-shaped objects onto the platform, trying to nudge your opponents off the edge and collecting any non-player shapes that fall. It’s simple yet skilful and wholly engrossing as you try and work out all the angles and impacts required for maximum movement. A slew of different wrestlers with their own push-on shapes and special powers further increases the game’s staying power.</p><h2 id="drop">Drop It</h2><div id="197680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Drop It</h3></p></div><p>There’s a very obvious bridge between video games and dexterity board games, but it’s rarely been so direct as it is in Drop It. Players take turns selecting from a variety of colored shapes and dropping them into the playfield, which is two upright transparent sheets with a thin space between them to hold the shapes in place. The higher your shape is atop the stack of existing pieces when it lands, the more you will score. But be careful: if you touch any other pieces of the same shape or color, you get nothing. This gives piece selection a frisson of strategy, dropping them a frisson of skill and the sheer unpredictable way all those shapes shift and roll off each other give it a whole lot of fun and excitement.</p><h2 id="hamster">Hamster Roll</h2><div id="197681" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hamster Roll</h3></p></div><p>Hamster Roll – often known by its original German name Hamsterrolle – is a balancing game with a unique twist. Rather than trying to balance your blocks atop each other in a tower, everyone is placing their pieces into slots on a giant wheel, trying to keep it as balanced as possible. If your placement causes the wheel to shift and pieces fall off, then you have to collect them and add them to your stash. First player to get rid of all their pieces wins. The sheer unfamiliarity of this is a big draw and, once you’re in, you’ll discover there’s a surprising amount of strategy to it as well, as you try to anticipate where following players might try and slot their pieces and torpedo those moves by blocking slots or throwing the balance off-whack. But watch out: get too tricksy, and it’ll end up being you picking up the pieces instead.</p><h2 id="looping">Looping Louie</h2><div id="197682" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Looping Louie</h3></p></div><p>While this was very obviously designed and marketed as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">children’s game</a>, it’s found a surprising fan base among older players as well. Thanks to an electronic gizmo, Louie pilots his little aeroplane in a circle above each player’s chicken coop, trying to knock their chicken discs off their perches. Loose them all and you’re out of the game. But you have a secret weapon: in front of your coop, there’s a paddle you can use to try and lift Louie above and save a chicken. It’s about as simple and fast as it’s possible for a game to be, but it also happens to be hilarious to play as Louie spins and dives about at unpredictable angles. And for the truly accomplished, there’s the perfect shot to practice and aim for, lifting Louie just the right height to clear an opponent’s paddle and dive straight into their coop.</p><h2 id="rhino">Rhino Hero</h2><div id="197683" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Rhino Hero</h3></p></div><p>Another children’s game that turns out to have a lot of appeal for adults, Rhino Hero, and its big buddy Super Rhino Hero, bring a load of super-powered character to the pleasure of stacking things high. In this original version of the game, players get a random stack of roof cards which they must add to the growing tower, supported by two right-angled wall cards. Stack carefully: although this is a fairly stable construct, you’ll be out of the game if you cause it to fall. The real fun is in the hidden powers of the roof cards that are revealed when you play them, which range from weirdly-angled walls to placing and moving the titular hero up the tower with great care, lest his pachyderm might cause the cards to fall!</p><p>For more, be sure to check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games of all time</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party games</a> for when you have people over, and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">best solo board games</a> for when you don't.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

<p>Over on Steam, Metaphor: ReFantazio is also off to a good start. It's already reached a peak concurrent player count of over 42,000 at the time of writing - and that's continuing to rise (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2679460/charts/">SteamDB</a>).</p>
<p>That's already ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-royal-review">Persona 5 Royal</a>, which has a peak concurrent player count of 35,474. Persona 3 Reload has a peak of 45,002, which surely Metaphor will beat imminently.</p>
<p>In all, it's looking like Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to be a great success for Atlus. It's the biggest new franchise for the RPG maker since Persona and takes place in a high fantasy world - a first for the company.</p>
<p>"Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy. What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox owners in the US will be able to play and purchase games directly from the Xbox App on Android from November.</p>
<p>The change follows the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Google. Earlier this week a US judge ruled Google runs a monopoly via its smartphone app store, meaning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-wins-major-google-lawsuit-further-opening-up-android-phones-to-third-party-stores">third-party storefront apps must now be made available from the Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<p>This has opened the door for Microsoft, meaning players can now purchase Xbox games on Android devices and then immediately stream them through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

<p>"The court's ruling to open up Google's mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility," said Xbox president Sarah Bond on social media. "Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android."</p>

<p>In response to the verdict, Google said it would push back against the ruling and request a pause on its required changes "to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers".</p>
<p>Further, Google has argued it exists in competition with Apple, so does not have a monopoly. "The Epic verdict missed the obvious," Google spokesperson Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote. "Apple and Android clearly compete."</p>
<p>Separately, Microsoft is also working on its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">web-based Xbox mobile game store</a>, which was set to launch in the summer. In August the company stated testing had begun, but it's unclear when it will properly launch - or if this Google ruling has had an impact on its intended release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Meta founder and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg has recently <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared</a> in a video interview with TikToker Pubity, revealing his deep-seated passion for the 4X turn-based strategy franchise Civilization. Zuckerberg claimed to be 'close' to Grandmaster status and said he'd be surprised if anyone at all could beat him at the game.</p>
<p><em>Priscilla [Chan, his wife] looked at my Steam account the other day and she was like, what? You've played this for more than a thousand hours? In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization. I think at some point, I should do a Twitch stream of me playing with someone because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to Grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world can beat me at that.</em></p>
<p>While the infamous <a href="https://wccftech.com/elon-musk-wants-to-spar-with-mark-zuckerberg-this-monday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cage match with Elon Musk</a> never actually happened, this is certainly more feasible—it wouldn't be hard to find several world-class Civilization players willing to take on Zuckerberg in an online match, especially if the billionaire wanted to make it more interesting with some sort of prize.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Zuckerberg actually follows up on that idea, Civilization aficionados are now getting excited about the upcoming launch of the seventh mainline installment in the series by Firaxis Games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> at Summer Game Fest 2024, Civilization VII is scheduled to be released on February 11, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch, kicking off what could well be a memorable year for Take-Two with <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>Firaxis Games has promised that Civilization VII will feature a wealth of gameplay enhancements that will appeal to veterans and newcomers alike. An overhauled tutorial experience and refined gameplay systems will make it easier than ever to get started, while returning players will appreciate a host of improvements, such as moving your army as a unit under the leadership of a commander, unlocking progression bonuses for your leaders across multiple play sessions, traversing navigable rivers, and more.
