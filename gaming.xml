		<p>What a hectic week this has been at TSA Towers! There’s been three separate events on the go, and I’ve travelled to Krakow to take part in Digital Dragons, a celebration of the Polish games industry. While I was there, I played an absolute bucketload of stuff – seriously, the games were sloshing out of my pail. I’ve already started to tell you about them, and they include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/vales-echo-is-a-dark-gothic-foray-into-the-cosy-horror-genre/">Vale’s Echo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/war-mechanic-weaves-an-intriguing-alternate-history-where-ww2-never-ended/">War Mechanic</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school/">XYZ – Tear Them Down</a>, all of which showcased the talent nestling in Poland’s borders. Alongside that, I’ve finished off playing the excellent Roadcraft, and I’m ready for more vehicular action with F1 25 this weekend.</p>
<p>From the team, we’ll start the week with <strong>Aran</strong>, who played and rather enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/blades-of-fire-review/">Blades of Fire</a>, where he got to play as himself, Aran de Lira. It loosely falls into that Soulslike bracket, but the action RPG combat is mixed together with a fun weapon forging system where you do some pretty literal blacksmithing, and there’s a really nice, supportive relationship between the game’s two leads. Definitely <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/a-blades-of-fire-demo-drops-tomorrow-with-saves-carrying-over-to-the-full-game/">check out the demo</a> if you’re curious about it.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has played something that&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> Destiny 2 this week, hopping onto a very slow Eurostar to Paris to go hands on with RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business and Hell Is Us… and that’s all he’s allowed to say about that right now, but keep your eyes peeled if you enjoy cyborg cops and mysterious Soulslikes.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued playing Oblivion and Split Fiction this week, but his strong recommendations led to <strong>Ade</strong> playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. “From the first few hours onwards I’ve been totally hooked, it’s an absolutely brilliant game. And that ending to chapter 1… Oh, wow!” He was also enticed to play Revenge of the Savage Planet from Dom’s review, saying, “it’s a terrifically fun and delightfully silly game, and the very good local co-op option is helping to fill the Split Fiction shaped hole in our lives.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> is still taking his time with Doom: The Dark Ages, doing just one level each day. He did manage to finally mop up the 100% in Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, “which is a huge relief after it became a chore by the end.” The weekend ahead has him looking forward to diving into a ton of indie games from the Endix indie game convention.</p>
<p>Also still on the Doom train is <strong>Miguel</strong>, who played some of that and a bit more of Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy. He’s also been getting back into Synduality: Echoes of Ada with Season 2 starting today, a bit of the cutesy co-op bunny farming game Cinnabun, and a random replay of Metal Gear Solid V.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> played his very first Civilization game with… Civ 6, because that one’s much cheaper than Civ 7 right now. “I can definitely see why Civ has a reputation as a “just one more turn” kind of game though, as with the Total War series, I find that engaging in the diplomacy system is boring and yields little benefit compared to being a brutal conqueror.”</p>

<p>And after that cheerful note, <strong>Tef</strong> rounds out this week having played a good chunk of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/sea-of-stars-throes-of-the-watchmaker-review/">Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker</a>, the free DLC for the rather great RPG. And he’s also been hands on with a trio of Sega’s upcoming Switch 2 games, with a solid port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/">Yakuza 0</a> getting a barmy multiplayer mode, the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/raidou-remastered-preview/">Raidou remake</a>, and then a frankly very odd <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/is-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s-better-with-joy-con-2-mouse-controls/">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> re-release where the main addition is some wonky mouse controls. So… that’s nice?</p>
<p><em>Anyway, what have </em>you<em> been playing this week? Let us know in the comments below.</em></p>

		<p>It’s Friday! And there’s exciting news! <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/23/elden-ring-review/">Elden Ring</a> remains one of the biggest games of all time, its Soulslike action crafted and honed by FromSoftware, who have got pretty good at the whole thing, having created the Souls genre in the first place. As one of the biggest games of all time, it’s little surprise to find that someone has eventually decided to turn Elden Ring into a movie, with Alex Garland – known for writing hit films like 28 Days Later and Sunshine, before moving into directing with titles like Ex Machina and Civil War – at the helm.</p>
<p>While this is undoubtedly exciting news, it does raise a few questions. While Alex Garland undoubtedly has the chops to craft a fantastical and emotionally resonant story, and to then bring it to fruition from the director’s chair, this will be his first true foray into the fantasy genre, previously having specialised in science fiction. It’s not his first brush with gaming though, as he co-wrote the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/10/11/review-enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/">Enslaved: Journey to the West</a>, a sci-fi take on the classic Monkey mythology, as well as serving as a story supervisor for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/01/14/dmc-devil-may-cry-review-ps3-xbox-360/">DMC: Devil May Cry</a>.</p>


<p>Elden Ring was created under the guidance of FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki, based on a mythological story written by George R. R. Martin, author of the fantasy novel series, “A Song of Ice and Fire.” That’s Game of Thrones if you’ve been living under a rock. The game has sold an astonishing 30 million copies worldwide, and we’re just about to witness the launch of a new entry in the series with Elden Ring: Nightreign due to launch on the 30th of May.</p>
<p>Elden Ring’s dark and menacing world of brutal challenges is undoubtedly an evocative setting, and, if done well, could be a fantasy epic to rival Lord of the Rings, or Martin’s own Game of Thrones. We’re definitely intrigued, and we can’t wait to find out more.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/apps/673208/discord-ai-forums-anniversary-gamechat</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discord-might-use-ai-to-help-you-catch-up-on-conversations.1197225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/apps/673208/discord-ai-forums-anniversary-gamechat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord has become <em>the</em> place for gaming communities on the internet. The company just celebrated its <a href="https://discord.com/blog/thank-you-for-ten-years">10th anniversary</a>, and its impact is now big enough that it’s available directly on PlayStation and Xbox and was ripped off by Nintendo for the Switch 2’s GameChat.</p><p>But as it tries to grow, one of the big challenges Discord faces is that, for big or longer-running communities, it can be hard to know where to start, hard to catch up to the speed of real-time conversations, and hard to sift through the potentially huge amounts of conversations and channels. A lot of communities used to form around forums, but Discord just isn’t a good replacement for that kind of structured messaging, as covered <a href="https://aftermath.site/discord-forums-move-champions-neverwinter-star-trek-support-faq">by <em>Aftermath</em>’s Luke Plunkett</a>.</p><p>“This is something we want to solve,” Peter Sellis, Discord’s SVP of product, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It is not our intention to lock a bunch of this knowledge into Discord.”</p><p>One way Discord wants to tackle the problem is add features that are “more amicable to structured knowledge sharing, like forums, that we could probably do a better job of investing in and is something we want to do for game developers,” Sellis says.</p><p>Another involves LLMs. “There’s an incredible opportunity now with large language models and their ability to summarize conversations,” he says. That could help Discord take a long conversation between multiple people — “what is essentially a really poorly structured shareable object,” he says — and boil it down to “something that could be more shareable and then potentially syndicated to the web.”</p><p>Sellis couldn’t share many other details, and couldn’t give a timeline for when any of this might be ready: “I haven’t seen a solution that we feel great about yet.”</p><p>Discord wants to do it right, he says — especially because a solution that makes information more easily accessible outside of Discord could involve a lot of work for server moderators and admins. “We have a very sensitive radar for stuff that causes them a bunch of work that doesn’t give them the return they need,” he says. (It’s wise <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/1/23781306/reddit-moderators-iama-celebrity-ama">not to piss off your moderators</a>.)</p><p>None of this was imminent, if it even happens at all. That said, “I assure you that this is something that people within Discord feel the pain of themselves,” Sellis says. “And when our engineers and product designers and product managers feel it personally, they generally want to solve it.” </p><p>Another big challenge Discord faces is how to build the product to serve both the needs of giant community servers and the tiny servers where groups hang out — especially when, according to Discord, 90 percent of “all activity on Discord” happens in “small, intimate servers.”</p><p>Sellis calls it “one of the biggest challenges for the team” — but also says that it’s “honestly the biggest opportunity.” He says that Discord thinks about how it can make people “feel comfortable in both these spaces, understand that there are different types of spaces, and the technology is familiar, but still different in both of these places.”</p><p>Sellis says that the biggest Discord server is Midjourney, a key company in text-to-AI image generation that lets you generate visuals right inside Discord. Midjourney became popular because it turned the “single-player game” of generating AI images into a multiplayer community. “You can just watch people try things, experiment, fail, succeed, embarrass themselves, etc. And that made it kind of like a collective action.”</p><p>He says Discord is seeing something similar with the recently launched <a href="https://support-apps.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/31598005086359-Wordle-FAQ#h_01JV3DTV60EKV39E0Y1ZAXERGX"><em>Wordle</em> app</a> on the platform, too, which lets you compete with your friends. </p><p>That all speaks to some of Discord’s larger vision. Sellis is seeing a trend that “everything is starting to kind of look like a game” and “Discord can be used as a social layer on any game to essentially improve its engagement, its socialness, and its multiplayer capacity. That’s something we like and are going to lean into.”</p><p>And as for Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">GameChat</a>? “I would say imitation is a very sincere form of flattery,” Sellis says. “Hard to imagine being more flattered than being copied by Nintendo.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Film production company A24 and Bandai Namco are both behind the project, based on FromSoftware's 30m-selling RPG.</p>

<p>It's unclear if FromSoftware itself is involved, or the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>.

<p>Rumours have previously swirled about an Elden Ring film, with Martin in particular hinting at its possibility.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me. What rumour?" he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-writer-george-rr-martin-tells-us-nothing-and-everything-about-a-live-action-spin-off">said in 2024 on his personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>Then earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-thrones-creator-says-theres-some-talk-about-elden-ring-film-but-his-involvement-could-be-limited">Martin said there was "some talk" about the film</a> but his involvement would be limited due to him being busy finishing up a certain book series.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-manga-turns-the-game-into-a-farce">Elden Ring has already been adapted in Japan into a manga series</a>, which turns the game into a farce with its Tarnished wretch struggling to survive.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-delayed-but-new-teaser-trailer-shows-work-in-progress">fan-made Elden Ring anime</a> in the works, due out later this year.</p>

            <p>Microsoft may have sealed the deal to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">acquire Activision Blizzard all the way back in 2023 for $68.7bn</a>, making history as the biggest company buyout in the video games industry to date, but only now has the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) finally given up its own fight.</p>
<p>The FTC has been contesting Microsoft's purchase since its conception in 2022, arguing - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-suing-to-block-microsofts-69bn-activision-blizzard-acquisition">antitrust lawsuit filed in December that year</a> - the deal would "harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets".</p><p> 

Following the acquisition in October 2023, the commission still fought on, issuing an appeal in an attempt to overturn the court's decision that December. However, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftcs-loses-latest-appeal-in-ongoing-battle-against-microsofts-activision-blizzard-acquisition">the 9th Circuit Court rejected the appeal</a>, and now the FTC has officially dropped its case.

</p><p>"The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed. By the Commission," <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">reads the official filing</a>, which was issued last night.</p>
<p>The news was shared by Microsoft president Brad Smith on social media, with the exec calling the decision "a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, DC".</p>
<p>Smith added he was "grateful to the FTC" for its announcement.</p>

<p>Since Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, the company has continued to keep games such as Call of Duty on PlayStation. Additionally, it has since added a number of its Xbox Studios titles to additional platforms, with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-grounded-ps5-tech-review-vs-switch-and-series-x-s">Obsidian's Grounded now being available on both Switch and PlayStation</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s been a great week if you’re a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 universe and its digital interpretations, with the yearly Skulls event dropping a load of Games Workshop-related information on us. You’ve got to love the return of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, or a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-are-getting-fresh-remasters/">remaster of the original Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a>, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> players haven’t been left out in the cold, with the announcement of the all-new Arbites class joining the roster next month on the 23rd of June.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZ176VVTJZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s fair to say that the Arbites are not messing around. They’re the brutal law enforcers of the Imperium – think Judge Dredd, with fewer hangups – and not only do they get to handle some tasty weaponry, they also have a dog. It’s not one you’re going to want to pet mind you, at least not if you want to keep your arm, as this cybernetic pooch is trained to chasedown and maim the Emperor’s enemies without hesitation. The CG trailer showcases that in visceral fashion, and, frankly, I can’t wait to try the new class out.</p>
<p>Originally launching in 2022 for Xbox and PC, before arriving on PS5 last year, Darktide is a multiplayer-focussed co-op shooter, where you’re tasked with bringing the Emperor’s light to the decidedly dark and dismal Hive City of Tertium. It’s an absolute blast, with action reminiscent of classic co-op shooters like Left 4 Dead, all set against the compelling backdrop of the grim Warhammer 40,000 universe.</p>
<p>We awarded the original version an excellent 8/10, saying, “Darktide is an absolute blast. Its heavyweight blend of melee and gunplay ensure that the flow of frantic runs into the hive city just keep on coming.”</p>

<p>The Arbites Class will arrive across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles on the 23rd of June, priced at $11.99 / €11.99. Stay tuned to TSA for more as we have it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-gets-new-update-and-new-paid-creation-mod-from-renowned-modding-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-beta-update-1-15-214-adds-very-low-display-settings-for-low-end-devices-and-improves-creation-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing phase on the Steam Beta ring</a>, Bethesda Game Studios has now released the Starfield May update to everyone. This is a relatively minor patch, although it does introduce Very Low graphic settings for expanded compatibility with lower end PC systems. It also expands the size limit of the official Creation mods to 2GB, while adding support for new icons.</p>
<p>Alongside the patch, a renowned modding team has also launched an interesting paid Creation mod called Watchtower. The mod was made by Kinggath Creations, which originally became famous with the acclaimed <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfields-outposts-meaningless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sim Settlements</a> series of mods for Fallout 4. Since joining the Bethesda Verified Creator Program, the team has released two fairly large mods for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (<a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/bards-college-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bards College Expansion</a> and <a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/east-empire-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East Empire Expansion</a>) and two minor mods for Starfield (<a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/mcclarence-outfitters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McClarence Outfitters</a> and <a href="https://kinggathcreations.com/at-hells-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">At Hell's Gate</a>).</p>
<p>Watchtower is much deeper, though. In this mod, which Kinggath says is seamlessly integrated with the base game and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space expansion</a>, players will experience a new storyline where they're chased by the titular new faction. They won't be alone, though, as they'll meet a fellow adventurer who has the same problem and will offer to help.</p>
<p>Throughout Watchtower, players will build a fleet and have them fight alongside you in space. The mod also adds powerful new ship attachments known as Skydrops, which allow your fleet to provide support drops or rain down attacks from orbit to assist you on your adventures on the ground. Dismantling Watchtower’s network will require destroying their listening posts and spy satellite arrays.</p>
<p>There's even a new player home, a formerly derelict star station that can be transformed into a hub for players, their crew, and other allied NPCs. Of course, there's also new equipment that can be looted from Watchtower troops, such as the new Cyberamps, which can augment the players' and crew's piloting skills. Watchtower is priced at $10; as a reminder, if you purchased the Premium Edition, you also received 1000 Creation Credits, which incidentally are the exact sum required to unlock the Creation mod.</p>

<p>In other news, a new rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-announced-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> that Starfield will be announced and released for PlayStation 5 this year. It is unclear whether this will coincide with the debut of another major expansion. About a year ago, Bethesda's Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the plan was to release annual expansions for the sci-fi RPG, but that was before Shattered Space received a lukewarm welcome.</p>

			<p>During the Warhammer Skulls 2025 livestream, there were a lot of announcements for Warhammer 40K games. We already covered the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dark Heresy cRPG</a> from Owlcat Games and the remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space Marine: Master Crafted Edition</a>, but there's lots more.</p>
<p>For example, fans of the real-time strategy genre will be delighted to learn that Relic Entertainment will release Dawn of War: Definitive Edition later this year on PC via Steam and GOG.</p>
<p>This version includes all the Dawn of War and Standalone Expansion content (4 Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, 9 Armies, and over 200 Maps). The Warhammer 40K RTS classic will feature 4K support, upscaled textures (4x the originals), and image-based lighting for a higher level of fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have all been improved, and new unit gloss and emissive lighting have been added. Relic also promised an improved gameplay camera and optimized HUD and screen layout for widescreen viewing. Lastly, the game has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with existing community mods.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fatshark has also announced updates for Warhammer 40K Darktide. The first paid DLC, the Arbites Class, will launch on June 23 for $11.99; on the same day, the developer will release a free update to improve onboarding and the narrative experience while also reworking the difficulty progression system and making all missions available at every difficulty level.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZ176VVTJZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The highly successful Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 also continues to be expanded by Saber Interactive. The endless co-op PvE Siege Mode will be released on June 26. Players will be able to obtain points with each defeated wave of enemies. They can then spend these points on ammunition, equipment charges, medical stims, and more, or use them to summon Astartes reinforcements such as AI Space Marines or the mighty Dreadnought.</p>

<p>Lastly, the turn-based tactical game Warhammer 40K Mechanicus II, due later this year on PC and consoles, was also shown with the debut gameplay trailer. The footage offers a first glimpse of a new planetary conflict between the Adeptus Mechanicus and the ancient Necron dynasty, in gripping tactical skirmishes across visually diverse and richly detailed battlefields, each teeming with opportunities for strategic domination.</p>

        <p>Alkahest has open world and immersive sim elements and also many goblins</p>

            <p>Alkahest looks very good.  Emphasis on 'looks' because both trailers released so far have been very scripted. Also, emphasis on 'good' because you get to bully goblins with your feet. It's an open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> boasting a combat sandbox full of the sort of reactive flourishes you might find in an immersive sim. Crucially for fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a> (I've seen the words "spiritual successor" floating about, although not from the devs themselves) one of those touches is a boot. Here's the boot in action:</p>

<p>You seem to have an archer mate, off screen, that you can button-tell to shoot at interactive objects and goblins. We first see this when our character slides up to a cargo lift, then gets catapulted upward when an arrow flies in from nowhere and severs the rope. They then grab a barrel mid-air, before falling back down and braining a goblin with it. I would be very surprised if this is unsynced, impromptu barrel-grabbing. There's probably a prompt that says 'grab barrel', if that. I'd also be a little shocked if the barrel hitting animation transitions into the fire throwing animation, then into the sword fighting animation, anywhere near that smoothly. Still, wishful stitching or no, someone had to animate all that, and they did a fine job.</p>
<p>As for a bit of context for what the game's like outside of combat, here's a trailer from last year:</p>

<p>Plenty of fun stuff in there. Weapon throwing. Wood kicking. Spiky wall advantage taking. Cart skitching. We shoot some oil barrels then light an arrow on fire at one point. We drink a potion then throw the bottle at a goblin, annoying him for just long enough to slip an axe into his neck. Where the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> influence becomes more apparent - and also presumably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkahest">where that name comes from</a> - is mixing and using a metal-heating substance to weaken an iron door before smashing through. Again, if this can be used to eg: render goblin weapons into useless melting slag-pops, rather than just being a specific door-based contextual action, I'll be surprised. Happy, but surprised.</p>
<p>Pre-rendered trailers are flaky, impenetrable things - much like armoured croissants - but the game that's being advertised here does look quite special, assuming it actually exists in any recognisable form. Also, it's nice to see all those Moria goblins getting work after that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cybershell.bsky.social/post/3lpoo2zmny22r">damning plot hole</a> was discovered in Lord Of The Rings. There's no release date as yet, but you can suspiciously examine <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3016620/Alkahest/">Alkahest on Steam here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/23/xyz-tear-them-down-takes-cyberpunk-traversal-to-school/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>You can feel the adrenalin rush of XYZ Tear Them Down almost immediately. This first-person, low-poly cyberpunk title gives you the ability to alter gravity while handing you an energy sword. While that already sounds like everything you could possibly need, in action this is a fast, visceral slice of futurism that keeps you on the move, and constantly on the edge of your gaming chair.</p>
<p>We were able to go hands on with the game at Digital Dragons in Krakow, where, incidentally, it came second in the show’s indie game awards. That’s immediately a glowing recommendation from the Polish game industry, and one that, based on our time with it, is thoroughly well deserved.</p>
<p><iframe title="XYZ - DEMO OUT NOW TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MiHty-eH_CY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>XYZ is fast. The movement here is sublime, and you can race through levels at lightspeed if you have the reactions and chops to do so. Specific surfaces allow you to change the gravity, making the wall the floor and vice versa, and once you’ve got the hang of it, this is a game that flows.</p>
<p>These sections are what the team term as ‘running’ sections, distinct from the second type which is ‘arena’. Here you get to put that energy sword to use, swinging it with abandon into the metallic bodies of the robot drones that stand in your way.</p>

<p>You can also bounce their projectiles back at them with a well-timed swing, though you have to also aim it with your cursor which takes a little more practice to perfect.</p>

<p>Each arena zone has a large door with the remaining number of enemies to dispatch emblazoned on it, and so you have to search around, utilising the gravity changing mechanic to find where they are in the level. It’s clever stuff, and even here, in its unfinished state, the game has a distinct vision and purpose.</p>
<p>It looks great too. I’d like to see more interactivity with your environment – smashing vases is surely the nunber one feature to put into your game – but the low-poly look works incredibly well here, providing a look that’s basically timeless.</p>

<p>Clearly influenced by games like Ultrakill, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/22/neon-white-review/">Neon White</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/26/ghostrunner-review-pc/">Ghostrunner</a>, speed and movement lie at the heart of XYZ. The team have absolutely nailed that aspect from the off.</p>
<p>What’s most impressive is that, not only is this their debut title, but they’ve also only just graduated from high school, which is astonishing. I can’t wait to see the finished article, and, on the strength of XYZ – Tear It Down this is a group of developers to keep an eye on.</p>

You don't have to start with the first book, but we'd recommend it anyway, because <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-Island-Official-Novel/dp/0399181776?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Island</a></strong> was written by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie/dp/0307346617?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World War Z</a> author <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=0399181776,0593159152,0593159187,0399181792,0593159179,0593159209&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Max Brooks</a>.

			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition">The Verge</a>, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft over its Activision Blizzard King acquisition. The organization <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">filed a motion to dismiss the case</a> today, May 22, 2025, finally closing the door on the FTC's attempts to block the largest acquisition in video game industry history.</p>
<p>Microsoft first announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King at <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">the beginning of 2022</a>, and by the end of 2022, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-microsoft-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/">FTC had filed a lawsuit against Microsoft</a>, and so began the long contest that has continued to stretch on, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-deal-free-to-proceed-ftc-pause-rejected-ninth-circuit/">after the FTC lost</a> in its one major change to really stop the deal from happening. At the beginning of this month, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-won-the-ftc-appeal-that-still-challenged-its-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost a final attempt</a> at stopping the deal and has chosen to put its fight to rest.</p>
<p>"<em>On May 7, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FTC v. Microsoft Corp...denying the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp,</em>" the filing reads.</p>
<p>"<em>The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed by the Commission</em>."</p>
<p>Vice chair and president of Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">Brad Smith celebrated the dismissa</a>l, saying "<em>Today's decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today's announcement.</em>"</p>
<p>After losing its initial attempt to stop the deal, Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">October 2023</a>, but that didn't stop the FTC from trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-appeal-against-judges-decision-hoping-to-delay-microsofts-closure-of-activision-blizzard-deal/">break it up</a> after the fact. The organization also spoke out against decisions Microsoft has made since the deal closed, like raising the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">laying off thousands of employees.</a></p>

                <p>With only three months left until the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Konami has taken to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgH4szXiqU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> to share the game's opening movie. In addition to giving us a whole lot of new footage to swoon over, the three-minute clip also features a new recording of Cynthia Harrell's iconic ballad, "Snake Eater." And yes, she <em>still </em>absolutely knocks it out of the park.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wgH4szXiqU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4wgH4szXiqU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though the song is fairly similar to the original recording, the overall mix feels a bit softer this time around, with the bass in particular standing out as less intense. The opening visuals, however, are substantially different. Whereas the original opening featured almost psychedelic visuals and was more enigmatic in tone, the new version focuses on showing off some of the game's most iconic moments, including a pivotal confrontation between Snake and The Boss.</p><p>That said, you can rest assured that one of the more beloved parts of the opening is being kept intact. According to the video's caption, fans will still be able to enjoy the "interactive elements from the original, included in the in-game version of the opening," such as using the analog stick to control the snakes that appear on screen.</p><p>Last August, GameSpot had the chance to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stays-loyal-to-the-mission/1100-6526099/" data-ref-id="1100-6526099">the first few hours of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and found it to be a "relatively straightforward, modernized remake of the original" that handled the game's transition into 2025 with "a deft hand." The game is set to release August 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X | S, and PC.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 22/05/2025:</strong> Bandai Namco released a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1925699586640707708">official US X account</a> regarding the Elden Ring movie, saying "<em>We're thrilled to announce that Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. and A24 are teaming up with writer and director Alex Garland to bring FromSoftware Inc.'s world-renowned video game Elden Ring to life as a live-action film.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>We're truly excited to bring the world of Elden Ring to fans in a new form, outside the game. Stay tuned. The path ahead is only beginning</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that the previously rumored Elden Ring movie with A24 producing and Alex Garland set to write and direct, is in fact real. No word on when it is happening, but Garland is leading the project with Bandai Namco set to collaborate.</p>
<p>The idea of an Elden Ring movie or TV adaptation has been brought up twice before by George R.R. Martin, who mentioned it <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-is-being-discussed-says-george-r-r-martin/">early last year</a> and then again in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/">summer 2024</a>, though there's been no word on whether it was really happening or not.</p>
<p>Weeks prior to Deadline's report, a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/">rumor appeared online</a> that it would be Garland writing and directing it and that the movie was happening, but the original source took down their claim that the movie was being made, and that Garland and A24 were behind it.</p>
<p>The original claim's removal led many to speculate that it was a false claim, though Deadline's report today seals that the report last month was correct.</p>
<p>Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R.R. Martin will produce the film. It's unclear when we'll hear about casting and when the film will start shooting, or what it could be about, but the previous rumor claimed that filming would begin in 2026.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how this adaptation shapes up. It's unclear how involved FromSoftware will be, and there are large parts of Elden Ring's story that are purposely left ambiguous. Your journey through the worlds that FromSoftware creates is always part of the larger story the studio is telling, but players who deeply love digging into the lore for all of FromSoftware's games know that, for as much as you can discover, there will always be gaps in what you can say happened for certain, and what the real 'story' behind the characters you'll meet and fight is.</p>
<p>Which is also part of the fun of the story in FromSoftware games, that you can imagine your own version of events for characters, even if their ending is laid bare to you with their corpse lying at your feet after you rest at a bonfire/site of grace. Whatever Garland decides his take on an Elden Ring story will be, it will undoubtedly be food for discussion online.</p>

The project is helmed by Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation, Civil War), who is set to both write and direct the upcoming film.</p><p>Bandai Namco confirmed the movie's existence following a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>We’re thrilled to announce that Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. and A24 are teaming up with writer and director Alex Garland to bring FromSoftware Inc.’s world-renowned video game ELDEN RING to life as a live-action film.</p><p>We’re truly excited to bring the world of ELDEN RING to… <a href="https://t.co/E3SJaRX1Jc" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/E3SJaRX1Jc</a></p></div>  — Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1925699586640707708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>In addition to Garland, a few other names have been attached to the film. Most notably is George R. R. Martin, who famously collaborated with Elden Ring studio From Software to help write the game's backstory. Meanwhile, Peter Rice, and DNA's Andrew MacDonald and Allon Reich, are all set to produce.</p><p>The news comes shortly after the release of Garland's latest film, Warfare, which was also made in partnership with A24 and has currently grossed over $32 million since releasing last month. It also comes just ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, an Elden Ring spin-off game that focuses on cooperative, PvE gameplay and it set to release on May 30.</p>

You’ll get Hall Effect sticks to prevent joystick drift, two mappable back buttons, and an ergonomic, wired design that’s responsive and good for long gaming sessions. Of course, you’ll also get the new C button--allowing you to dive into Nintendo’s GameChat feature and hang out with friends. There’s even a 3.5mm jack and on-controller audio controls.</p><p>Since this is an officially licensed product, you’ll find Switch 2 branding on the face of the controller. Bundled with a 10-foot USB cable and a two-year limited warranty, it looks like a pretty great deal at $50.</p></div>                      </div>
