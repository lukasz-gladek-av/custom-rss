			<p>The use of generative AI tools in game development has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a major point of controversy within the video game industry. Some figures, notably, many studio heads and executives, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-says-game-characters-should-be-ai-trained-human-scripts-more-natural-conversations/">are all for using generative AI in game development</a>. Others <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/">don't think it's necessary at all</a>. While we know Epic Games chief executive officer Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">sits firmly in the former camp</a>, he has also weighed in on another aspect of the issue, the fact that digital stores like Steam require developers to disclose that generative AI tools were used in the making of their game.</p>



<p>Currently, games published to Steam that were made with generative AI tools must disclose their use. ARC Raiders, for example, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">includes such a disclosure at the bottom of its Steam page</a>, though with how forward Embark Studios has been about its use of generative AI, we wouldn't have needed the tag to know generative AI tools were used.</p>



<p>In other cases, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3823370/Beyond_Words/">like the recently announced game Beyond Words from former Timesplitters and GoldenEye developers</a>, if not for the disclosure at the bottom, we'd likely not know generative AI tools had been used. And then there are those who still don't disclose its use, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-generative-ai-assets/">admitting it only after they are caught having used it</a>, or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">don't admit it at all, and quietly patch it out</a>.</p>



<p>In response to Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman arguing for the removal of generative AI tags and disclosures on storefronts like Steam <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1988991435358482621">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Tim Sweeney agreed with Workman's post, saying that having generative AI tags on platforms like Steam "<em>makes no sense</em>."</p>



<p>Not because those who care about avoiding games made with generative AI have to keep an eye out for the disclosure, and even if it's not there, keep themselves aware for any signs of it. But because in his mind, there will come a day when every game is made with generative AI tools. </p>



<p>"<em>The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production</em>."</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>GenAI being used in "<em>nearly all future production</em>" might be what the future looks like in Tim Sweeney's head, but it's debatable that GenAI tools will catch on to such a degree. When Nexon's chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">claimed that players should already be assuming all games are made with GenAI</a>, multiple developers stood up to point out that they would never use GenAI tools for their creative endeavours.</p>



<p>Whichever side you fall on, GenAI tools in game development, especially in triple-A game development, are undoubtedly here to stay. So there will continue to be games made with these tools, and we could get to a point where the disclosures are removed because enough games are using these tools. However, it would be interesting to see if developers who are against using GenAI would respond by highlighting that they did not use GenAI in making their game. It would seriously put to the test what executives are saying, <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">that consumers "<em>do not care</em>" if something was made with GenAI or not</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-full-liquidation-on-santas-sleigh-set-now-selling-at-zero-profit-to-clear-before-christmas-2000648144</link>
            <guid>1366783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as <strong>LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory</strong> after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/">At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price</a> that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.</p>
<p>The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over <strong>30,000 units already sold</strong> and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>343-Piece Build That Is Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>The <strong>343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders</strong> and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.</p>



<p>The <strong>Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures</strong> that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The<strong> eight wrapped gifts</strong> that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The <strong>guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories</strong> hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.</p>
<p>The <strong>sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide</strong> which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.</p>



<p>The set works just as well as a <strong>hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver</strong> puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.</p>
<p>LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.</p>

<p>Kirby has proven his absolute dominance in the region once again, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> getting off the start line in style with a sweet 195,594 sales under its belt.

<p>Switch 2 hardware sales have seen an expected boost by the presence of a new exclusive Kirby in town, with the console finding itself comfortably at the top of the hardware chart with an additional 126,953 units to its name. It has also been a strong week for PS5 sales, mind you, with the Digital Edition achieving 23,381, and the Pro even overtaking the Switch Lite and standard models with 11,367.</p>
<p>All this means that combining the console SKUs swings things in Sony's favour this time, with the three PS5 units clocking in at 36,920, while the Switch 1 models combine for 29,370.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> probably won't get a second major DLC expansion on the scale of Claws of Awaji, Ubisoft's associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed. It's a blow to fans who are accustomed to getting a couple of major expansions per Assassin's Creed, and a boon to people who haven't even played Shadows yet, let alone the 10-hour-long Claws of Awaji, and are getting dry heaves from FOMO.

<p>"As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently," Lemay-Comtois revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">JorRaptor</a>, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">Ian Games</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years." The developers are trying "to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it."
</p>
<p>Claws Of Awaji aside, the first year of Shadows updating brought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-a-self-driving-horse-but-i-implore-you-not-to-use-it">self-driving horses</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-getting-a-much-needed-parkour-update">posher parkour</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-adds-in-collabs-with-dead-by-daylight-and-balatro-of-all-things">Balatro collaborations</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-latest-update-brings-in-a-nightmare-difficulty-mode-and-another-weird-collab">nightmare difficulty</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-date-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-mode-alongside-plans-to-make-its-open-world-more-convenient">a more conveniently made open world</a>, amongst other tweaks to the furnishings. The second year "will probably be more sparse, not a drip-feed, but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more," Lemay-Comtois suggested in the interview.
</p>
<p>"I'm not announcing anything at this point," he went on, "but our strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often, but for Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more what good, chunky little piece of meat we can drop and have people come back and enjoy it." 
</p><p>As IGN note, 2017's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> both had two expansions, while 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla got three, with 2023's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> starting out as yet another Valhalla expansion. Why is Shadows getting stiffed with a measly single expansion? Because it was uncommonly hard to develop, Lemay-Comtois explained, with a major technological overhaul that contributed (along with the "soft" performance of stablemate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>) to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">a delayed release</a>.
</p>
<p>"I think with Shadows, we had a big jump in generations," he said. "The engine work that we had to do on Shadows took a lot of time and a lot of our resources. The planning for the post launch was not really as clear as it would have been on [previous AC games] where the technology is more stable and well known."
</p>
<p>Shadows originally had a proper season pass, but Ubisoft canned it alongside the delay announcement, and decided to give away Claws of Awaji for free. "I remember during pre-launch we had the Season Pass," Lemay-Comtois added. "And that situation changed when we pushed back on the release date. That plan changed quite a bit and then we had to kind of adapt to the situation. So because of the new tech, because of the new generation, because of the pushes we had in production."
</p>
<p>It seems possible the decision to stop at one Shadows expansion also reflects wider turmoil at Ubisoft, who are busily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Six. Anyway, the upshot is that you AC diehards now have around 10 hours of playtime back to fritter away on something else. I recommend the similarly shadowy and backstabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark Of The Ninja</a>. Alternatively, you could spend it playing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake that absolutely isn't coming in 2026</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bag-the-razer-iskur-v2-x-ergonomic-gaming-chair-while-its-going-for-just-250-on-amazon-2000647135</link>
            <guid>1366759</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/">Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.</a></p>
<p>It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Design With Plush Fabric</h2>
<p>The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.</p>



<p>Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.</p>
<p>The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!</p>
<p>This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/"> To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount.</a> It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

<p>The Final Masterpiece</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, here's a welcome surprise! Hot off the back of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, Bloober Team has shared with us the <em>next</em> project that it's working on for Switch 2, and it's none other than an all-new <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> package.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a> will arrive on Switch 2 on <strong>19th December</strong>, bundling together <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">Layers of Fear 2</a>, every DLC expansion, and brand-new chapters into one spooky edition fully optimised for the new system.</p>
<p>There are the added bonuses of HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, too, <em>and</em> you have the option to play with motion controls or touchscreen inputs if you see fit. Here's the official blurb from Bloober Team and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Layers of Fear</em> is a first-person experience that blends story-driven exploration, environmental puzzles, and psychological horror. The Final Master Edition brings together the intertwined stories of three characters — the Painter, the Actor, and the Writer — each consumed by their devotion to art. The atmosphere is elevated by a chilling yet hauntingly beautiful soundtrack composed by award-winning musician Arek Reikowski. Rebuilt with HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, this edition deepens immersion in its melancholic and spine-chilling world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It all sounds like a pretty strong way to experience these psychological horror titles. The full Final Masterpiece Edition will be available on the eShop for <strong>$39.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) next month — because the holiday season <em>really</em> needs some more scares, right?</p>
<p>For those curious, we had a perfectly good time with Cronos: The New Dawn when it arrived on Switch 2 back in September, describing it as "a celebration of survival horror, paying homage to all the genre greats effectively, although failing to do anything truly original" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">our review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Seemingly Won’t Get Another Claws of Awaji-Sized Expansion, Says Ubisoft]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-another-claws-of-awaji-sized-dlc-expansion/</link>
            <guid>1366738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has been the one bright spot in Ubisoft's troubled times over the last couple of years. Even though it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">wasn't able to contend with Ghost of Yotei on PlayStation consoles</a>, the company's recent first-half year results report <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">noted that Shadows overperformed overall</a>. Despite that, however, and despite the fact that Ubisoft's original plan was to put out multiple expansions for Shadows, it now seems like Claws of Awaji, which was released in September, will be the last - and only - DLC expansion the game receives.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">IGN</a>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>, associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois confirmed that, at least right now, Ubisoft is not planning to do another expansion for Shadows that is on the same scale as Claws of Awaji.</p>



<p>"<em>Well, we live in a murky world these days. So, with the caveat that anything can happen in the future, cause as [Assassin's Creed] Mirage just proved</em> <em>and as the crossover stories from [Assassin's Creed] Odyssey to [Assassin's Creed] Valhalla before it,</em> <em>things could come up in the future</em>," Lemay-Comtois began.</p>



<p>"<em>But</em> <em>as of now, at this moment, for Year 2, there is no expansion on the size</em> <em>of Awaji that is planned, currently. We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but</em> <em>it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years. And whether or not this is the right way to go or a good learning, I think it's more of an experience we're trying with Shadows, to keep it small and reactive, to see how the community feels about it and react to it. The learnings that come out of that will be applied to whatever other projects we do next</em>."</p>

<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Interview With Post Launch Director Simon... (AC Shadows DLC)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Iijrbz8XBc?start=559&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Lemay-Comtois continued to explain that for Year One, the team's approach was to try and be as reactive as possible, but with Year Two, the team can slow down as it's not "<em>putting out fires</em>" anymore, and really decide what solid "<em>chunks of meat</em>" they can release for Shadows.</p>



<p>Listening to Lemay-Comtois, it sounds clear that Ubisoft shifted in its plans for Shadows. Though, as Lemay-Comtois points out, anything can still happen, it seems like the chances of another proper DLC expansion for Shadows are slim to none, and Slim is getting ready to leave town.</p>



<p>This directional change could also be due to the completion of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Ubisoft's deal with Tencent and the finalization of Vantage Studios</a>. Now that the Assassin's Creed franchise is under the new subsidiary, it could be the case that everything about how the franchise is carried forward is getting some sort of re-evaluation, including the future of Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/treat-yourself-or-a-gamer-in-your-life-with-the-16-inch-alienware-aurora-gaming-laptop-while-its-discounted-2000648026</link>
            <guid>1366729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios released update 1.4.0 this week, and in the patch notes teased a “very hot fix for the locked room exploits.” It turns out they weren’t kidding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the release of the patch, players — as they often do — jumped into the hugely successful extraction shooter to give this fix a proper test. They’ve been able to cheat their way into locked rooms as before, but what they now find inside… well, Embark called it a “very hot fix” for a reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forward_Problem_7550 discovered</a>, locked rooms now turn you into a fireball if you glitch inside. The clip below shows the trap in action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction to the change is positive, with most players getting a kick out of what Embark has done here. “Best part of this is the clowns doing the glitch lose all their stuff to someone who legitimately opens the door with a key. CLASSIC!” enthused A_Tortured_Crab. “It's genuinely a really good fix,” added vedomedo. “Hopefully this is the mindset they keep going forward. Punish the exploiters and reward legit players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, some players are saying they’re more inclined to use their keys to enter locked rooms legitimately in the hope of finding “some dingus who hasn't read the patch notes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technically this isn’t a fix, as players can still use the exploit to enter locked rooms. But it is an eye-catching workaround, and will surely put off players from trying to cheat their way inside a room after they’ve been cooked once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Would’ve been better if they just didn’t say anything and rolled this out,” suggested Maverixk_. “Imagine all the door glitches finding this out and losing all of their s**t before word of mouth spread. Would’ve been hilarious.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all the update did. It’s also patched the gun quick swap exploit. Full patch notes are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Patch Notes 1.4.0:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Content and Bug Fixes</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Exploit mitigation mechanisms have been added for all locked rooms across all maps.</li><li>Fixed the gun exploit that allowed you to shoot quicker than intended by swapping to a quick use item and back.</li><li>The exterior access to Spaceport's Control Tower locked room has been blocked off.</li><li>Fixed the issue that sometimes caused low resolution textures in the Main Menu.</li><li>Fixed players being able to push each other by jumping on each other’s backs.</li><li>Fixed lighting artifacts that would sometimes occur upon entering maps.</li><li>Raider Voice now correctly respects the selected voice option after restarting the game.</li></ul><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you exploit the doors now: 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/JndqMjMpUn</a> <a href="https://t.co/81aFPE0ucD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/81aFPE0ucD</a></p>— Scrappy (@TheRooster) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRooster/status/1993997509971292249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><em>If you're hunting for the best offers this week, we're actively rounding up the strongest Black Friday deals on video games, tech, and more.

So, we're going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like many of you, we're big fans of Monster Hunter. It's why we put this Superdrop together. But in our excitement, we missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of Monster Hunter. As a result, the overall construction of this Superdrop is not up to the standard you have come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Pulling Superdrops back isn't something we're going to do very often, but we're committed to doing better. Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, we're going to pull this one back and will share new details and an updated release date in a few months.

<p>"Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's your favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Timesplitters</a> game?</p>
<p>Did you say <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">TimeSplitters 2</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_future_perfect">Future Perfect</a>? Or even the first one, aptly named "<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a>"? Good, we're gonna get along just fine!</p>
<p>Now, whilst we're not here to announce a new version of Timesplitters 1, 2, or 3 for Switch consoles or anything amazing like <em>that</em>, almost as excitingly, a fan-made re-imagining composed of a campaign mash-up of all three games alongside a huge multiplayer suite of multiplayer challenge maps and modes, has finally — after 13 long years — <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/">been released to the public on PC</a>. And it's going down well with anyone in the know.</p>

<p>We've been following the progress of this one for a long while now on and off, and it's absolutely been a real labour of love for its creators, Cinder Interactive, having worked on this project in some form or another since way back when Crytek gave them their full IP blessing off the back of a Timesplitters mod for <strong>Unreal Tournament 2004</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, that transports us back, kids. In fact, you should really check out the <a href="https://www.timesplittersrewind.com/about">extensive Project History over at the game's official site</a> to take in the full and fascinating story behind the twists and turns in bringing this new game to life.</p>
<p>So, it's a bit of a surprise, and certainly something worth highlighting, that after a number of setbacks and just how long it's taken, Timesplitters: Rewind has finally released. It's actually real! Furthermore, and if you've checked out the trailer above, we're sure you'll agree, it looks absolutely STONKING. And it's free.</p>
<p>Ah. Timesplitters. Just when we thought we were out (to be fair, we've been out for a couple of decades) you've gone and dragged us right back in. Now, where's our GameCube controllers?</p>

            <p>
A couple of weeks after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">arguing that generative AI shouldn't be considered in videogame reviews</a>, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is calling for Steam and digital storefronts generally to stop requiring generative AI disclosures. 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney's argument is broadly that all videogames will use generative AI tools at some stage, so you and I might as well stop hearing about it. He thinks tagging things as made with generative AI is only necessary when there's a formal need to prove legal authorship, or help buyers understand whether they have rights to a piece of digital art. There's no sense letting regular old videogame players learn that stuff. It will only make us upset, and possibly less willing to play videogames with generative AI in them, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-voice-actor-union-takes-fortnites-darth-vader-chatbot-to-court">Fortnite</a>.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, I'm expanding on the material a bit, there. Here's the actual quote from Sweeney, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/opposing-steams-ai-disclosures-epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-says-game-stores-should-drop-the-ai-tag-because-it-makes-no-sense-when-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">James Radar</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-thinks-stores-like-steam-should-stop-labelling-games-as-being-made-with-ai-it-makes-no-sense-he-says-because-ai-will-be-involved-in-nearly-all-future-production/">Percy Gamer</a> via the endless, crocodilian march of progress. 
</p>
<p>
"The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation," Sweeney wrote on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312">Xitter</a>, responding to a user who called for Steam and other digital storefronts to eliminate the gen AI labelling. "It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."
</p><p>
I've already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">ranted at length</a> on these pages about the relationship between the trillion-dollar generative AI industry and layoffs, creative theft, spiking energy consumption, and general misinformation. Sweeney alludes to a couple of these bugbears in his tweet about rights - many of the bigger budget, better-known generative AIs are created by processing vast quantities of human art and discourse without consent, even if you can argue the toss about whether they're actually filching somebody's intellectual property.
</p>
<p>
I do wonder, though, whether I'm most pissed off simply by the fact of some mogul smugly telling me that a certain state of affairs will inevitably come to pass, especially when he stands to benefit as an AI advocate, and especially when he and his fellow farseers at Epic have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-lay-off-830-people-thanks-to-unrealistic-metaverse-ambitions">screwed up their soothsaying catastrophically</a> in recent history.</p>
<p>As with the previous comments about genAI in videogame reviews, the logic here is patently self-serving. Sweeney is telling you not to ask how the sausage was made, because he's got a bunch of them on the barbie. Incidentally, it's estimated that <a href="https://www.farmsanctuary.org/news-stories/2022-ag-census-factory-farms-expanding/">about 99% of livestock in the USA were factory-farmed in 2022</a>, but you shouldn't have to worry your little head about that when you're deciding whether to buy a hot dog. 
</p>
<p>
I do agree that Steam's generative AI policy requires a change, inasmuch as the majority of disclosures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">are so vague as to be fundamentally useless</a>, revealing neither the exact choice of genAI tools, nor the materials from which they derive their probabilistic outputs, or when, where and how exactly they were used in development. 
</p><p>
The Steam disclosure for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders</a>, for example, explains that "during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." It took <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">a proper interview</a> with developers Embark to learn that the game makes use of text-to-speech tools for voiced barks, and machine learning procedures for arachnid robot animations. You may not be fussed about those applications for generative AI, but you can't make that call if you don't know about it.

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Sends Millions of MacBook Air to Amazon for Black Friday, M4 Model at Zero-Profit Pricing Defies Logic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-sends-millions-of-macbook-air-to-amazon-for-black-friday-m4-model-at-zero-profit-pricing-defies-logic-2000648128</link>
            <guid>1366681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple releases new MacBook iterations almost annually with more powerful custom silicon that pushes performance boundaries forward. <strong>March brought the MacBook Air with M4 chip</strong>, succeeding the previous M3 generation through enhanced efficiency and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Each year follows the same pattern where Apple maintains strict full pricing across official channels to preserve premium brand positioning. But today, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">at $749, down from $999, this marks the first time Apple has authorized Amazon to sell the 256GB MacBook Air M4</a> at razor-thin or potentially zero profit margins for Black Friday. The <strong>25% discount</strong> represents unprecedented accessibility to current-generation MacBooks that typically resist price reductions for years after launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Portable Computing</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 processor has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU</strong> architecture that can handle professional workflows while being fanless and weighing less than 3 pounds. The improved Neural Engine processes Apple Intelligence features on the device which keeps data private because it doesn’t send it to cloud servers where third parties could get to sensitive information. The fanless cooling works well enough because the processor doesn’t get too hot even when it’s under a lot of stress: This makes it quiet, which professionals like when they’re working with clients or in the library.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB unified memory is a big improvement</strong> over the old 8GB base configurations which made it hard for users to run more than one program at a time. This memory architecture lets<strong> the CPU and GPU share RAM</strong> which gets rid of the performance problems that happen when separate components copy data between different memory pools. The memory bandwidth sends data to processors quickly enough to keep them running at their best, instead of waiting for slow memory access that slows down less powerful systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has great picture quality thanks to mini-LED backlighting</strong> that lets it reach 500 nits brightness and supports the P3 wide color gamut. This level of brightness makes it easy to see outside in direct sunlight, where regular laptop screens wash out completely. The color accuracy is also good enough for professional photo and video editing without needing extra monitors<strong>. True Tone technology changes the white balance based on the light around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip and optimized macOS power management</strong> that changes performance based on workload demands make the battery last 15 to 18 hours during normal mixed use. <strong>Video playback can last up to 20 hours</strong> but tasks that use a lot of power, like rendering video, drain batteries faster but still give you a lot of time to use them without plugging them in. This long battery life lets you work on the go instead of just using a laptop that is tethered to a power source and covers full workdays and evenings without having to worry about running out of battery.</p>
<p>The <strong>integration of the ecosystem with the iPhone</strong> makes workflows easier with features like Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy text or images from your iPhone and paste them directly into your Mac. Handoff lets you switch between devices in the middle of a task, and FaceTime and Messages keep conversations going no matter which device you pick up. And AirDrop lets you send files between Apple devices right away.</p>
<p>For $749, the MacBook Air M4 with 256GB has the latest Apple Silicon, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and a battery that lasts all day. This Black Friday, it’s 25% off the regular price. Apple’s authorization for Amazon to sell at minimal margins creates exceptional value that rarely occurs on current MacBooks. If you want Apple’s latest ultra-portable without paying full premium pricing, <strong>this record-low deal is the best MacBook value available</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/googles-newest-and-best-pixel-watch-is-100-off-for-the-first-time-this-black-friday-at-amazon-2000647344</link>
            <guid>1366678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of 2025’s best Android smartwatches has just become one of the best Black Friday deals of the week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">The 41mm version of the outstanding Google Pixel Watch 4 is 22% off at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $350.</a> The best-in-class display jumps out at you immediately, being 50% brighter than the previous model of the Pixel Watch, and its Gemini AI integration comes into play early and often to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>As a fitness watch, the Pixel Watch 4 is among the very best, with amazing accuracy in measuring and evaluating your exercise. It’s also an elite-level health and sleep tracker, easily in the same class as the best Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches. All of its features are bolstered by the outstanding battery life of the Pixel Watch 4 — 40 hours per charge in standard mode and 72 hours in low-power mode, with the ability to get back to 50% strength after just 15 minutes on Google’s new side charger, and all the way from 0 to 100% in roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to look past the face of the Google Pixel Watch 4, which is an enormous upgrade from previous models. The first-of-its-kind Actua 360 display lives beneath a dome of sturdy scratch-resistant 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and is 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 — up to 3,000 brilliant nits, which can be lowered to as little as a single nit when you need to keep things dark. It’s a 320 ppi AMOLED screen that’s remarkably easy to see even in bright sun, and highly reactive as a touchscreen for ease of control.</p>
<p>Beneath the Actua 360 display lives the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor and Cortex M55 co-processor, which drives all of the Pixel Watch 4’s many features and keeps them moving with smooth, seamless, pro-level speed. That’s handy whether you’re using any of the 40+ exercise modes for a workout, the dual-frequency GPS for accurate location, or the Gemini AI as a hands-free assistant for pretty much anything you ask of it.</p>



<h2>An Actual Fixable Smartwatch</h2>
<p>What do you do when your smartwatch’s battery fails, or when its display gets cracked or damaged? Most likely you shop for a new one while hoping against hope for a semi-reasonable trade-in deal to lessen the blow. The Google Pixel Watch 4’s battery is replaceable, as it its display. You can’t do it yourself at home, but it can be shipped to Google or taken to a certified Google repair technician for a fix. Of course, with its robust battery and Gorilla Glass-encased display combined with IP68 water and dust resistance, the odds are low you’ll need to seek service, but it does provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Need a Cliff’s Notes rundown of the Pixel Watch 4’s many fitness features? How about Daily Readiness score, real-time run guidance, Morning Brief, Heart Zone Training, Cardio fitness score, Calorie Tracking, and Floors Climbed? That’s maybe a third of them, just to give you an idea of how impressive the Pixel Watch 4 is if you’re thinking about a new workout watch. And now’s the time to make that upgrade, thanks to the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">22% off Black Friday sale at Amazon that makes the Google Pixel Watch 4 a total steal at just $350.</a></p>

<p>Battlefield 6 developers have stated that in-game audio issues will receive a “full pass” to solve them. </p>



<p>EA’s Battlefield 6 has been out for close to two months now, and the game has already received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-drops-to-half-price-for-black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive discount</a> due to a Black Friday mega sale on one platform. However, as sales and marketing for the title progress, the developers are also constantly working to resolve issues, and now they have set their sights on BF6’s in-game audio problems. </p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-in-game-audio-issues-will-receive-a-full-pass-for-fixes">Battlefield 6 In-Game Audio Issues Will Receive a ‘Full Pass’ for Fixes</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/some-battlefield-6-players-still-cant-hear-enemies-creeping-up-on-them-so-devs-are-doing-a-full-pass-to-fix-niggling-sound-issues-for-good-hoping-we-can-share-more-details-on-that-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Florian Le Bihan, principal game designer, recently responded to a comment on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1993685559462527420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) about fixing footstep audio issues in Battlefield 6. Le Bihan stated that “the entire in-game audio is receiving a full pass to solve those issues, including fixing some issues that caused some sounds to completely cut.” The principal designer added that they are still working on the problems and verifying the changes, and they hope to share more details soon. </p>



<p>Florian Le Bihan also spoke about Battlefield 6’s mouse-and-keyboard issues in the same thread. He first confirmed that fine-tuning mouse sensitivity “broke with the last update” and will be fixed in the upcoming patch. For keyboards, he was asked whether Class-related keybinds can be removed, and Le Bihan confirmed that those buttons will be removed from the keyboard after the next patch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Niko Partners, the analytics firm covering the video game industry in Asia and MENA markets, published <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-news/">its latest weekly report</a>, which points to a potential source of problems for the Japanese video game market. As geopolitical tensions between Japan and China continue to rise, China might be inclined to take retaliatory actions, like starting to deny approval of Japanese games.</p>



<p>According to Niko Partners, "<em>Japan is the single largest source of import game approvals to China</em>, <em>accounting for roughly 30% of all licensed foreign titles over the past two years</em>." We know that China is a massive market that any publisher would want to be able to crack, since that would be millions of potential players. </p>



<p>Though the firm clarifies that there's been no indication China would stop approving games from Japan, it's definitely a possibility, and would be a huge blow to Japanese developers and publishers who have much of their business tied to Chinese players.</p>



<p>Issues between the two nations are currently rising due to comments from Japan's Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who recently suggested, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-diplomat-dissatisfied-japan-talks-000859056.html?guccounter=1">per Bloomberg</a>, that Japan could interfere with China attempting to reunify Taiwan.</p>



<p>China has now called on Japan to retract the comments, and has already begun taking actions such as having flights cancelled and travel advisories issued on travel to Japan, suspending the importing of Japanese seafood, and pausing the approval of Japanese films.</p>



<p>With film approvals already getting paused, it's not a huge leap to imagine video games are next. We'll see how the rest of it continues to unfold, but if their relationship continues to decline, then it'll likely be quite some time <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">before we see the Nintendo Switch 2 make it over to China.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> hasn't sold as well as publishers Paradox predicted. As such, the company have announced plans to write-down 355 million Swedish Krona (approximately £28 million/$37 million) of the game's development costs - essentially the financial way of saying something along the lines of 'oops, this isn't worth as much as we thought it was'.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">notice</a> announcing this write-down Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester said the game's a "strong vampire fantasy" and that Paradox are pleased with the work that's gone into it from developers The Chinese Room. As such, the finger of blame's being pointed at Paradox themselves for having overtly high expectations regarding how well Bloodlines 2 would do financially.</p>
<p>"A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down," Wester said. "The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales."</p>
<p>Here are the bits which are relevant to those of us who aren't here to look at Paradox's money numbers. In light of this, Wester said the publisher will "evaluate how we best develop" World of Darkness games going forwards, but stressed that Bloodlines 2 will still be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2s-latest-patch-offers-up-fixes-as-a-roadmap-promises-more-improvements">the additions</a> which have already been set in stone for it. "Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year," Wester confirmed. So, if you bought the premium edition, you'll still get the two expansions you paid for.</p><p>Paradox's admission here follows departed Chinese Room co-founder Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-should-have-been-called-something-else-agrees-former-creative-director">recently revealing</a> that the studio started trying to convince the publishers to call the game something other than Bloodlines 2 was a priority for him almost as soon as he became involved in the project, which bumped from studio to studio during development. "I came in and went, 'we can't make Bloodlines 2, we can't make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but we can make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>," Pinchbeck recalled.</p>
<p>The name didn't change, leaving Bloodlines 2 as a game that in the eyes of many is defined as much by what it isn't as what it is. "The overall problem here is that in a year packed with absolutely amazing games of all shapes and sizes, Bloodlines 2 is merely okay," wrote Dominic Tarason in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>. "An entertaining mid-budget way to pass a few evenings in a familiar setting."</p>

But it was actually the obligatory <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> performance that stole the show. And if you see the Labubu float break containment, well, please call 911. Meanwhile, I’m jealously checking in on everyone else’s <a href="https://x.com/i/lists/1460694648381448196">Black Friday gaming haul</a>. Now let me go check on my candied yams before they burn.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is a $37 million flop</h2> <p>Paradox Interactive announced the write-down <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire--the-masque,c4273262">to investors yesterday</a>. It takes full responsibility for the game’s troubled reception following years of development hell and multiple studios at the helm. The RPG is currently sitting below a 60 percent positive rating on Steam.</p>

 <p><em>“</em>A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future,” CEO Fredrik Wester said.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> won’t get a second expansion</h2> <p>“As of now at this moment for Year Two there is no expansion on the size of Awaji that is planned currently,” associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iijrbz8XBc&amp;t=559s">YouTuber JorRaptor</a>. “We’re still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it’s not a full-on DLC the way a Season Pass would have had in the previous years. And whether or not this is the the right way to go, I think it’s more an experience we’re trying, to keep things small and reactive and see how the community feels about it.”</p>

 <p>He suggests that the game’s original delay and resources spent on improving the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> engine are the reason a second big DLC felt out of <em>Shadows</em> post-launch roadmap, rather than soft sales or a lack of player interest.</p>

 <h2><em>The Witcher 4</em> won’t be at The Game Awards 2025</h2> <p>“I’m very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards,” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1993732049044128043">on X</a>. “Thanks to everyone who has already voted – your support means a lot of to us. We won’t be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we’re, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry’s great night alongside all of you.”</p>

 <h2>The backlash to OpenAI’s war on anime continues</h2> <p>The Japan Commercial Broadcasters’ Association released a new statement pushing back on AI plagiarism machines. The group is “strongly urging generative AI developers,” <a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASTCV2RG1TCVUCVL06NM.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><u>Asahi Shimbun</u></a> reports (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/openai-and-sora-2s-use-of-anime-ips-could-destroy-japans-content-production-culture-and-ecosystem-says-japans-biggest-broadcasting-association"><em>IGN</em></a>). The association also called on OpenAI to “respond sincerely to claims made by member companies in regard to copyright infringement caused by generative AI.” I’m sure that will happen any day now.</p> <h2>The great <em>Pokémon</em> vs <em>Digimon</em> debate</h2> <p>“Digimon and Pokémon are fundamentally different in their core concepts and appeal,”&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> producer Ryosuke Hara said in a <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/issue-1005-of-mcv-develop-is-online-now-inside-ryosuke-hara-on-digimon-story-time-stranger-paul-sulyok-on-the-disappearing-public-gaming-sector-the-game-kitchen-on-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-and-mor/">recent interview</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/digimon-story-time-stranger-producer-says-he-hopes-it-shows-players-the-difference-between-digimon-and-pokemon/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “Each has its own unique strengths. We believe that these differences will naturally become apparent as players experience this title.” He doesn’t go into detail about what those differences are, though they’ll be obvious to anyone who has played both <em>Time Stranger</em> and <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> this fall.</p> <p>He said <em>Time Stranger</em> is trying to be less insular than past Digimon games by easing players into the world. “Simply delving into the appeal of powerful Digimon like the Olympos XII would only resonate with existing Digimon fans, so we made sure to introduce several mysteries at the beginning of the narrative—designed to spark curiosity and encourage all players to move forward with interest,” Hara explaioned.</p>

 <h2><em>Splitgate 2</em> will re-launch next month</h2> <p>The portal shooter came and went in the blink of an eye earlier this year is headed back to a soft launch beta on December 4. CEO Ian Proulx is confident things will be different this time, and no, he wont’ be back at the Game Award <a href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-apology-video-maga-hat-ranked-battle-royale-1851784272">with a new hat</a>.</p> <p>“The thing that has me most optimistic is the results from the playtests,” he wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1p5pwa5/comment/nqm368w/">on Reddit</a>. “Even though the numbers aren’t crazy big, we have seen them grow every time both in terms of player count and in terms of Net Promoter Score (NPS). Our NPS score is the highest it has ever been by far (which basically in the survey measures how likely people are to recommend<em> Splitgate</em> to a friend). This has been our most important metric to improve, and we have done just that.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-sony-ps5-kojima-2000647534">The wait for <em>Death Stranding 2</em> on PC might not be as long as we think&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/another-long-time-game-studio-is-on-the-chopping-block-2000647684">Splash Damage faces studio-wide layoffs after a private equity buyout&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">EA explores AI that can upsell players on sports game card packs&nbsp;</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
