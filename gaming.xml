<p>Hermen Hulst, one of PlayStation’s CEOs, has spoken to the BBC during the brand’s 30th anniversary. Before diving into the history of the company, Hulst was doorstepped with a question about AI in game development. It has been a sore spot for a while, with some developers leaning much more into AI, sometimes at the cost of human employees.</p>



<p>Hulst assured that while AI has the potential to revolutionise game development, ‘preserving the human touch’ is still of the utmost importance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>In an interview with the BBC, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the co-CEOs of PlayStation, spoke about the past, present, and future of the brand.</p>



<p>To open <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the interview</a>, Hermen Hulst spoke about AI in game development, given that he oversees software at Sony’s gaming giant, while Nishino focuses more on hardware development.</p>



<p>Hulst explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming: one for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content</p>



<p>Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In many ways, AI is allowing for extraordinary leaps in the development process, allowing for procedural generation, the likes of which were previously unobtainable. AI is also being used to automate laborious, repetitive, or operationally impactful tasks that might have traditionally slowed down the development workflow.</p>



<p>In others, it’s putting jobs at risk, ‘stealing identities’, and putting fear into industry workers the world over.</p>



<p>As the interview unfolded, Hulst and Nishino explored the success of Astro Bot, recent leaps into live-action adaptations, and the origins of PlayStation. Nishino laid out a neat anecdote, recalling his mother’s toy store and how he would demo gaming devices for unaware shoppers when the technology was just starting to emerge.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a world where AI and human-based game development can exist in sheer harmony? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The production of the second season of Fallout is well underway, and recently, Walton Goggins—who plays The Ghoul—appeared on social media to share a brief message. His post went hand-in-hand with a new image showing him in the makeup department having his ‘ghoul skin’ applied.</p>



<p>In Fallout, the live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic series that aired in April 2024, Goggins plays Cooper ‘The Ghoul’ Howard. He stars alongside Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, and his performance in the show’s opening season was nothing short of stellar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-feo-fuerte-y-formal">Feo Fuerte y Formal</h2>



<p>To celebrate his return to the character of The Ghoul, Walton Goggins posted:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels good to slip back into this skin. I do this shit for the love of the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He was referencing a line his character utters in the show, and the image that accompanied the post showed him having a thick layer of prosthetics applied to portray a Fallout ‘ghoul’, a character warped by radiation.</p>



<p>In April, Fallout debuted on Prime, and it became the biggest launch the platform had ever seen. From there, things skyrocketed for the Fallout franchise. Across the entire suite of games, player counts and investment soared, and titles like Fallout 76 reached new heights, several years after being released.</p>



<p>It was recently suggested that the production for the second season of Fallout is moving ahead of schedule, but it’s still likely it won’t surface until 2026. These days, almost every show has a two-year gap between seasons, much to the chagrin of viewers.</p>



<p>For instance, the first season of The Last of Us was released in January 2023, and the second season isn’t expected to drop until a few months into 2025. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-surprising-skill-and-weapon-changes-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent behind-closed-doors demo, we played a section of Monster Hunter Wilds and asked the developers about changes made to weapons and other systems, the biggest being the separation of Equipment Skills between weapons and armor. Read on for more details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I played the demo, I realized major changes have been made to the Skills system, where damage-increasing skills and weapon-specific skills like Attack Up and Focus can only be found on or applied to the weapons themselves – a pretty impactful change. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Watch new gameplay of Monster Hunter Wilds above, including footage of Seikret and camp customization.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the new Equipment Skill system. In interviews, the dev team referred to skills for your weapons casually as Weapon Skills. Running with that unofficial terminology, let’s call equipment skills for weapons Weapon Skills, and equipment skills for armor Armor Skills. This means that equipment skills in Wilds are split up into these two categories. Weapon Skills generally include skills that affect actions and damage output, while Armor Skills assist in other ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armor Skills include support skills like Speed Eating and Divine Blessing. This new system also affects slots, and the devs confirmed that weapons can only use decorations with skills categorized as Weapon Skills, while armor can only use decorations with skills categorized as Armor Skills.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/weapon-equipment-skills-1733278360038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see this bow has the built-in Equipment Skill "Focus." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This really opens up a lot of new ideas. I asked director Yuya Tokuda about his intentions here, and he replied, “Only armor had [built-in] equipment skills until now, but when a piece of armor had a type of skill only effective when used with a certain weapon type, that meant you would have to choose the corresponding weapon. This led to an unavoidable situation where it was harder for people to use those kinds of armor pieces.” The new system solves that issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds now lets you take two weapons with you on a hunt, which must have been another reason behind the change. Since you can now swap to a sub-weapon mid-hunt, it's great to be able to keep on hunting while maintaining the skills you need to increase your damage to a suitable level or handle your weapon better.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/armor-equipment-skills-1733278376038.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You can see the Hope Armor Set includes the built-in Equipment Skills "Divine Blessing" and "Stun Resistance." </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one thing I'm still curious about. While I was able to confirm that skills like Guard are indeed on weapons that can block, I'm still not sure which type of equipment utilizes skills like Evade and Evade Distance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapon Balance</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is weapon balancing. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto confirmed that there will be significant weapon balance changes in Wilds. He told me, “There will be major changes not just after what we saw in the open beta, but also in the form of changes we had always intended to add to the final product.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda said, “In particular, we plan on putting quite a lot of work into the Lance, Switch Axe, Insect Glaive, and Sword and Shield based on feedback from the open beta.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued, “We've tweaked values across the board relating to weapon damage and overall balance, including balance regarding endgame content.” In addition to these numerical changes, the four aforementioned weapon types have (quote) “plenty of work put into how they feel to use."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the development side is certainly listening to the voices of the players, they were already taking a proactive stance toward weapon balance changes, and it seems that a proper announcement about the topic will come at a later date. Seeing their attitude put me at ease; the game is clearly in good hands. We’ll see how their intentions pan out when the final game is released in February 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the team told me about the direction and concept of the Switch Axe and the Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Insect Glaive Changes and the Return of Vaulting Dance</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Insect Glaive is one of my main weapons, and my very first impression was that there were fewer aerial attacks available. It made me wonder if the concept was to reduce the relative number of aerial attacks and make it a primarily grounded weapon. I brought this up with Tokuda, and he began by revealing to me that Vaulting Dance is making a return! This is one of the actions that was so important to opening up possibilities for aerial combat with an Insect Glaive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to why it wasn't there before, Tokuda said, "We were concerned that putting it in this time around would cause players to use nothing but existing movements, rather than focus on the new parts of the game. That's why we decided to remove Vaulting Dance for a time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the reason it was brought back, he replied, "Many players at gamescom and Tokyo Game Show told us that it's not about how strong or weak it is, but that Vaulting Dance is part of the Insect Glaive's very identity. We realized that we weren't on the same page as our players there, and so we immediately decided to bring Vaulting Dance back while balancing the ability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was happy to hear about this balance decision as an Insect Glaive user. That said, I did have difficulty during the open beta with the controls for its new charge attack, and I'm hoping that they'll make it easier to use as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Updating the Switch Axe to be More Attractive to Players</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I then asked about what direction they want to take with the Switch Axe. Tokuda told me the concept of the Switch Axe had not fully gotten across to players, and that the dev team is balancing it in order to convey what makes it a good weapon. Specifically, he said, “The Full Release Slash that comes at the very end of an attack didn't fully stand out, both in terms of feel and numbers, making it less attractive when compared to similarly positioned attacks for other weapons. We'll be sure to address that." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After hearing about the developers' plans to balance the Switch Axe to make it a more attractive weapon, it's clear to me that it's being properly discussed. Their process to come to the decision to make changes to the Switch Axe backs that up even more, so I don't think that should be a point of concern any longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm sorry to admit that I can't go into as much depth on the Switch Axe as with the Insect Glaive, as it isn't one of my main weapons, but other media outlets were also present at this hands-on session, and I’m sure some of them include players who go hard on the Lance, the Gunlance, the Bow, the Long Sword and more, so keep an eye out online for more information on your favorite weapon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Translated by Ko Ransom.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if you’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard this one before</a>: A major publisher launched a live-service game intended to compete with one of a small handful of industry-eclipsing giants. It did not immediately succeed to the tune of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Now studios are shutting down and workers are getting laid off. Just another Tuesday in the video game industry.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest victim of what’s effectively become a cycle is Ubisoft’s <em>XDefiant </em>– or rather, the people who made the recently-released game and, in doing so, followed management’s ill-advised edict to swipe a slice of pie from <em>Call of Duty</em>’s endlessly mashing maw. By many measures, the free-to-play shooter, which featured factions from a veritable <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rainbow of wrung-dry IPs</a> like <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>, was solid, a "perfect antidote to those tired of <em>Call of Duty</em>’s modern-day bloat," <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/behind-its-identikit-theme-and-terrible-name-xdefiant-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-those-tired-of-call-of-dutys-modern-day-bloat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to PC Gamer</a>. But as we’ve seen time and time again, “solid” doesn’t convince millions of people to abandon habits and communities they’ve spent years building up in whichever game rules the roost.&nbsp;</p><p>“Solid,” at best, inspires brief curiosity, which is why executive producer Mark Rubin was <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today able to boast</a> that “we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game” while the Ubisoft mothership declared that it’s pulling the plug on the game, shutting down studios in San Francisco and Osaka, planning to “ramp down” another studio in Sydney, and potentially lay off hundreds of workers.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the discontinuation of <em>XDefiant </em>brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game," Ubisoft chief studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert wrote in <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the company's official site</a>. "Even if almost half of the <em>XDefiant </em>team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."</p><p>This masterpiece in refusing to name the parties responsible – Where are the “difficult consequences for teams working on the game” coming from, de Waubert? Who is making these decisions? Certainly not the workers themselves – harks back to similarly grim ends met by <a href="https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Redfall</em></a>, as well as unannounced games from companies like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/microsoft-cancels-big-new-blizzard-game-after-six-years-of-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-studios-head-confirms-projects-cancelled-in-wake-of-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> that never even got the chance to launch and face off against their genre’s respective entrenched boogeymen.&nbsp;</p><p>The triple-A strategy of trying to muscle in on the turf of giants with just a brand portfolio and a dream, only to throw up your hands when you don’t strike gold after a few months, is a dead end. The Ubisofts of the world cannot keep doing this. And yet:</p><p>“Developing games-as-a-service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy,” wrote de Waubert, citing successful series like<em> Rainbow Six</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, and <em>For Honor</em>, the most recent of which began in 2017, all of which arguably tried to do something unique, and all of which were given actual time to find their footing. “It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with <em>XDefiant </em>to our future live titles.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As part of the shutdown, the publisher plans to shut down its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief Studios and Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert revealed the news in an email sent to Ubisoft employees that was subsequently posted online, saying that the shooter was "not able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The full message can be found below.</p><blockquote>Today, I wanted to share with you that we’ve made the difficult decision to discontinue development on XDefiant.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite an encouraging start, the team’s passionate work, and a committed fan base, we’ve not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market. As a result, the game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it.</blockquote><blockquote>Concretely, that means that as of today, new downloads, player registrations and purchases will no longer be available. Season 3 will still launch, and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025, out of appreciation for both our dev teams who worked on it and for XDefiant’s active players.</blockquote><blockquote>Unfortunately, the discontinuation of XDefiant brings difficult consequences for the teams working on this game. Even if almost half of the XDefiant team worldwide will be transitioning to other roles within Ubisoft, this decision also leads to the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney. To those team members leaving Ubisoft, I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition.</blockquote><blockquote>Developing Games-as-a-Service experiences remains a pillar of our strategy, and we’ve achieved significant successes, like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor, among others. It’s a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles.</blockquote><blockquote>Globally, we are determined to take the necessary steps to put the company back on a path to growth, innovation and creativity and make sure we can set you up for success. This means continuing to radically evolve our mindset for Production and Business practices, which we will share more about soon, and doing targeted restructuring when necessary. I know that the situation brings questions and expectations, and we will share regular and transparent updates.</blockquote><blockquote>My sincere thanks for your continued dedication as we navigate these trying times together.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin also shared a message thanking fans and saying he was "heartbroken." He also shared refund details, saying that any purchases made within the last 30 days will be fully refunded and that those who purchases the Ultimate Founder's Pack will also get their money back. Refunds should happen automatically with 8 weeks, he said.</p><blockquote>I am unfortunately here today to announce that XDefiant will be shutting down. Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date TBD) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.<p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack, you’ll receive a full refund. Players who made any purchases within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. Those refunds should happen automatically within 8 weeks of today and you can find more details on our official website, <a href="https://t.co/pNWQ3cifIZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://XDefiant.com</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, Ubisoft and the SF Dev team embarked on a bold adventure to develop a new arcade shooter called XDefiant. It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) while bringing back a more “old-school” arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the Dev team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It’s a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post.  Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when XDefiant launched was amazing—we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass 5 million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If there’s one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, it’s the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This “player-first” mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made XDefiant so special. From my very first post about XDefiant, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around XDefiant. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,</p><p>Mark</p></blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">XDefiant joins Concord <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">as the latest service game to abruptly shutter</a> not long after launch. Unlike Concord, though, XDefiant will be given a bit of grace, with its servers not due to shut down until June 3, 2025. Ubisoft also plans to go forward with releasing Season 3, though downloads and purchases will no longer be available.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hello XDefiant Fans,</p><p>I am unfortunately here today to announce that XDefiant will be shutting down.</p><p>Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Despite only officially launching the game in spring of this year, Ubisoft has <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">already announced</a> that it’s ending development and sunsetting its free-to-play team-based shooter <em>XDefiant</em>. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/27/22904775/ubisoft-hyper-scape-cancelled-battle-royale"><em>Hyper Scape</em></a> before it, <em>XDefiant</em> had high expectations, with Ubisoft touting more than 1 million players in its closed beta last year. Now, it will disappear quickly, as it’s no longer accepting new players as of today and is <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fxdefiant-our-message-to-players">scheduled to shut off the servers</a> entirely next June.</p><p>Despite a delayed launch, Ubisoft said that <em>XDefiant </em>had reached more than 10 million players in its first two weeks and “outperformed expectations thanks to acquisition and strong average revenue per session day.” However, it couldn’t maintain that momentum, and by this fall, rumors of trouble surfaced, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reporting that concurrent player numbers across all platforms had fallen below 20,000.</p><p>Ubisoft states, “The game will remain available to all players who joined <em>XDefiant </em>before December 3rd, 2024. All functionalities, including progression, events, rewards, and achievements, will continue to be available until June 3rd, 2025.” The planned Season 3 content will still launch, and the company is refunding anyone who bought the Ultimate Founders Pack, as well as players who bought VC and DLC in the last month.</p><p>Like with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em></a> developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a>, this shutdown comes with job losses. According to Ubisoft, “difficult consequences” are leading to “the closing of our San Francisco and Osaka production studios and to the ramp down of our Sydney production site, with 143 people departing in San Francisco and 134 people likely to depart in Osaka and Sydney.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Starting today (December 3, 2024), new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available. We will still release our Season 3 content in the near future (exact date to be determined) and the servers will remain active until June 3, 2025.</p><p>For those who purchased the Ultimate Founder’s Pack, you’ll receive a full refund. Players who made any purchases within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded. Those refunds should happen automatically within 8 weeks of today and you can find more details on our official website, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>XDefiant</em>.com</a>.</p><p>A few years ago, Ubisoft and the [San Francisco] development team embarked on a bold <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,901 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> to develop a new <a title="Genres > Arcade [65 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [3,942 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> called <em>XDefiant</em>. It was from the start, an incredible challenge. Not only were we trying to shake up the genre by removing Skill-Based Matchmaking while bringing back a more “old-school” arcade shooter experience, but we were also diving into the high-risk, high-reward realm of free-to-play. And for that I want to applaud not only the development team but also Ubisoft leadership for taking that chance!</p><p>Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [340 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play games</a> take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It’s a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue.</p><p>I am, of course, heartbroken to have to be writing this post. Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure. Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team! A team that really punched above its weight class.</p><p>And what they achieved is truly remarkable. The early response from players when <em>XDefiant</em> launched was amazing—we broke internal records for the fastest game to surpass five million users and in the end we had over 15 million players play our game! That is something to be extremely proud of, especially considering how tough this genre is. So, thank you to all of the developers who put their passion into making this game!</p><p>If there’s one thing, I hope we can all take away from this experience, it’s the importance of open, honest communication between developers and players. This “player-first” mentality along with respectful, non-toxic conversations between developers and players has been one of the standout differences that made <em>XDefiant</em> so special. From my very first post about <em>XDefiant</em>, this was the vision I wanted to champion, and I hope it leaves a positive mark on how the game industry treats its players and communities.</p><p>To our players, THANK YOU! From the bottom of my heart, I want to express my deepest gratitude for the incredible community that has grown around <em>XDefiant</em>. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.</p><p>With the utmost of love and respect,<br>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A month and a half after denying reports it was poised to pull the plug on its free-to-play live-service shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> - which launched back in May - Ubisoft has confirmed it's doing just that, resulting in the closure of three production studios and 277 employees losing their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's chief Studios and portfolio officer Marie-Sophie de Waubert <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant">announced the end of XDefiant's development in a post on the company's website</a>. "Despite an encouraging start," de Waubert explained, "the team's passionate work, and a committed fan base, we've not been able to attract and retain enough players in the long run to compete at the level we aim for in the very demanding free-to-play FPS market."
</p>
<p>
"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment," de Waubert continued, "and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it." As such, new downloads, player registrations, and purchases will no longer be available from today, but Season 3 will launch as planned and servers will remain online until 3rd June, 2025.

<p>
Unfortunately, the news doesn't end with XDefiant's cancellation. Ubisoft has also confirmed it's closing its San Francisco and Osaka production studios, and will "ramp down" its Sydney production site. As a result, 277 employees across all three units will lose their jobs. This equates to a little over half of the XDefiant team worldwide, with Ubisoft noting other employees working on the project will transition elsewhere within the company.
</p>
<p>
"To those team members leaving Ubisoft," de Waubert continued in her statement. "I want to express my deepest gratitude for your work and contributions. Please know that we are committed to supporting you during this transition."
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/2wPUTEuXKpVoCvINTcxvGR/xdefiant-a-message-to-our-community">message</a> to the XDefiant community, executive producer Mark Rubin - who in October insisted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xdefiant-will-not-shut-down-after-season-four-executive-producer-insists">there were "no plans" to shut down the game</a> - wrote, "Free-to-play, in particular, is a long journey. Many free-to-play games take a long time to find their footing and become profitable. It's a long journey that Ubisoft and the teams working on the game were prepared to make until very recently. But unfortunately, the journey became too much to sensibly continue."
</p><p>
The announcement comes at a turbulent time for Ubisoft, which has been dogged by underperforming titles, delays, and project cancellations over the last few years. In an emergency investor call held at the start of 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">announced considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a>, leading to the cancellation of three unannounced projects and a programme of "targeted restructuring" that resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">series of layoffs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the publisher has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancelled The Division: Heartland</a> after more than three years of work, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows' release into next year</a> following a "softer than expected launch" for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.

			<p>Realistically, this news doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. Considering the huge amount of hot water Ubisoft is in right now, with the troubles only seeming to continue in quantity and significance, it's not too much of a surprise that XDefiant is officially closing down. Several sources have revealed this information to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, which is where it was first reported. The news came in an internal all-hands meeting that took place today. Ubisoft has decided to shut down the game because of poor player numbers and a lack of player spending. This is something that Ubisoft has commented on multiple times themselves, especially in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">their financial reports</a>. Times for Ubisoft have been particularly difficult as of late, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-funnels-more-money-into-star-wars-outlaws-marketing-than-any-other-game/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't launch the way they were hoping and didn't bring in as much revenue as they lied. In addition to that, they now have XDefiant as a sinking ship, with a lot of people being very uncertain about Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was delayed to next year.</p>
<p>Due to XDefiant closing down, it's said that there will be a significant number of employees laid off from the San Francisco studio as well as supporting studios, with some of the staff already receiving their severance information. Ubisoft is set to experience another wave of layoffs in February, as the San Francisco studio will be closing its doors completely. It's not said whether the staff working there will be relocated to work elsewhere within the company or if they've been let go completely.</p>
<p>Season 3 of XDefiant will be the last full season of the game, with a skeleton crew continuing to work on the game until June 2025, which is when the game will be sunsetted.</p>
<p>Mark Rubin, Executive Producer on XDefiant made a <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy statement on X</a> today, announcing that the servers for the game will remain active until June 3, 2025. Any players who purchased the Ultimate Founder's Pack will be refunded. Additionally, any players who made any sort of purchase in the game within the last 30 days will also be fully refunded and this will happen automatically within 8 weeks.</p>
<p>As of today, new downloads and player registrations will no longer be available, and the game will only be available to those who were previously playing it and had registered or downloaded the game prior. All information about the closure is listed on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official XDefiant website</a>.</p>

That means its startup noise, which eternally rings in the minds of people of A Certain Age like our own personal Big Ben, is also getting up there in years.

Well, new to me.</p><p>According to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkSd30d7JzM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video from YouTuber Nitrocosm</a> (brought to my attention by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/janus.bsky.social/post/3lcg5lnhcp22f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath pal and freelance contributor Janus Rose</a>), the PS1 startup noise is not one sound, but three. On top of that, they’re stored directly in the PS1’s BIOS – firmware that contains basic software for booting the console and running games&nbsp; – which explains why they’re chopped up and individually modified instead of lumped together into a single file: The BIOS is just 512 kilobytes. Today’s vast audio libraries would make it melt like the mind of a Victorian peasant experiencing a single crumb of Dorito dust.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Playstation Startup Sound Explained" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkSd30d7JzM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The three audio samples are: 1) a chime, 2) a synth sound with a phaser effect on it, and 3) a reverse tape sound effect. These, according to Nitrocosm, are played at different speeds and mixed together to create the final product. If you want to hear the original sounds in all their individual glory, you can watch the video.</p><p>This is, I imagine, a far cry from how the sound effect is generated on the PlayStation 5, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/488901/playstation-anniversary-aesthetics-graphics-sounds-how" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added a nostalgia-laden startup sequence</a> to celebrate the 30-year anniversary. But I’ll never get tired of appreciating instances in which constraints bred creativity and limitations led to something that stuck with us for decades. We must, if nothing else, respect the old ways. We wouldn’t be here without them.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Several sources have revealed that Ubisoft will be shutting down XDefiant in June 2025.</p>



<p>The news was mentioned in an internal all-hands meeting today. The decision was made due to poor player numbers and a lack of player spending, according to sources familiar with the decision to sunset the game.</p>



<p>It’s understood that layoffs will impact a significant number of employees at the San Francisco studio and supporting studios, with some staff already receiving severance information. Another wave of layoffs will happen in February, with Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka closing its doors. Around 170-180 people are understood to be losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Season 3 will be the last entire season of XDefiant, with a skeleton crew maintaining the title until June 2025. According to those familiar with the situation, Ubisoft will be updating XDefiant players on refunds for cosmetic items and other purchases at a later date.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>XDefiant started its uphill battle soon after the release of Season 1, with a lack of player spending having the team scrabbling to cut costs. </p>



<p>In August 2024, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/">XDefiant was on borrowed time</a> despite initially having strong player numbers. Frustrations within the studio were always aimed at its leadership, who refused to take responsibility for the project’s shortcomings, which could have been avoided with a better studio culture, said the people.</p>



<p>In late March 2024, I&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on the studio’s toxic work culture</a>, and despite an internal investigation that concluded last month, I&nbsp;was told that the issues had been swept under the rug and that its problems were still prevalent.</p>

<p>UPDATE – Mark Rubin has <a href="https://twitter.com/PixelsofMark/status/1864090964748321266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1864090964748321266%7Ctwgr%5Ec7382b5ea525a198c6ed45941a8bc5ef8cb83cee%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D71846action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">issued a statement</a> that XDefiant is closing down.</p>

            <p>
We're less than a week away from Indiana Jones' next big adventure - in which the boulder-bothering, grail-quaffing archaeologist goes in search a big old circle - and ahead of its release, developer MachineGames has revealed PC requirements and, as a bonus, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq97d1RkdRM">new trailer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Great Circle in question (it's in the title, so probably relatively important as the story proceeds), is, as game director Jerk Gustafsson <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview/">previously explained</a>, "very real and mysterious". It just so happens to connect many historical sites such as Giza, Easter Island, Sukhothai, and Nazca as it runs around the Earth's circumference, and nobody has ever figured out why. Except, probably, Indiana Jones in about a week's time.
</p>
<p>
And if you're a PC player considering joining Indy on his globe-trotting, first-person adventure, MachineGames has now detailed exactly what hardware you'll need to have stuffed inside your computer to ensure it runs at a satisfactory level. In all cases, you'll be wanting to free up 120GB of storage, with full specs detailed at the bottom of this page.

<p>
As noted over on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3Od8RFBcAOGNxNDlD801Rp/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-specs">Bethesda's blog</a>, Indy potentially comes in a little smaller on Xbox, with its basic installation size weighing in at roughly 87GB. However, there's an optional 45GB Higher Resolution Textures pack that's installed by default on Xbox Series X.
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launches for Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on Monday, 9th December, but it'll be playable from 6th December for anyone that pre-orders the Premium Edition, Premium Edition Upgrade, or Collector’s Edition - you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-the-great-circle-release-times">specific release times over here</a>. As for PlayStation 5 owners, it'll be available on Sony's console in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ian Higton positively vibrated with excitement when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">went hands-on with the Great Circle</a> back in October.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> was in a bit of a state when it launched earlier this month, as developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> was all too aware. It took less than a day for the studio to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">acknowledge</a> the post-apocalyptic  shooter's "rough edges", and it's been flinging out fixes since then. And today brings a third patch, this one weighing in at around 20GB on PC.
</p>
<p>
Patch 1.0.3 (which totals a rather more svelt 7.91 GB on Xbox Series X/S) isn't, perhaps, as sexy as GSC's first, which came with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">eye-catching promise of over 650 fixes</a>. Improvements are still improvements, though, and this time the studio has set its sights on crashes, memory leaks, control adjustments, mission and side missions, plus balance and AI.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, update 1.0.3 addresses a potentially heart-stopping issue that was causing player saves to vanish after a hard reboot of their PC or Xbox. "Thanks again for your support," the studio concludes in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474965">release notes on Steam</a>. "We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur."

<p>
Stalker 2's significant technical issues were highlighted repeatedly at launch, despite an otherwise solid critical reception. "It all hurts the game's natural playability quite badly, even if it is often funny", we said in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">three star review</a> - so hopefully GSC can get its shooter to a place the underlying experience is more readily able to shine.
</p><p>
Not that bugs have stemmed player enthusiasm for the developer's long-awaited sequel; GSC announced Stalker 2 had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">sold over 1m copies</a> just days after release. Its massive popularity does, however, appear to have made the Ukrainian-developed game the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">target of a new Russian disinformation campaign</a>, falsely claiming it scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/disney-speedstorm-soundtrack-ost-gameloft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s understandable if you haven’t played the 2023 game <em>Disney Speedstorm</em>. It is a free-to-play Disney-themed kart racer made by Gameloft, and you can be forgiven if that combination of words does not sound particularly appealing. But it is, by all accounts, pretty solid. What is more important than the game itself, however, is the soundtrack, which is one of the strangest things I have ever heard in my life.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLauxD4ZvQhqsPp1ftsJUV9YjO_nFTudHM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Every song on the <em>Disney Speestorm </em>soundtrack is, for better or worse, a maximal club mix of an existing Disney theme. <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, <em>Inside Out</em>, <em>Frozen </em>, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>, <em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, <em>Hercules</em>, and<em> Monsters Inc.</em> are all represented. Some of the tracks are so confusing as to be simply disorienting. There are not one or two, but three separate versions of the Randy Newman song “You’ve Got A Friend In Me”. Others, like “Zero To Hero”<em> </em>from <em>Hercules</em> and “Trust In Me”<em> </em>from <em>The Jungle Book</em>, are better than they have any right to be.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not typically electronic music that I enjoy, but the sheer amount of fun the composers are having here is incredible to behold and appropriate for a goofy kart racer. There is clearly a lot of love here. In no particular order, here are some of the more beguiling and/or compelling tracks. Please enjoy.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Atlantica ( Part of Your World ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGtGPzBJttU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Part Of Your World” from <em>The Little Mermaid</em> from Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Arendelle ( Do You Want to Build a Snowman ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D6B0pAvKOTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Do You Want To Build A Snowman?” from <em>Frozen</em> from Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - The Nightmare Festival ( This Is Halloween ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JldCm_fH7O4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“This Is Halloween” from <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Andy's Room ( You Got A Friend In Me ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylAJF85xpm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“You Got A Friend In Me” from <em>Toy Story</em> as it appears in Disney Speedstorm.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - The Great Wall ( I'll Make A Man Out Of You V3 ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B7Qh2GmaQXA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“I’ll Make A Man Out Of You” from <em>Mulan</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Jungle Ruins ( Trust In Me V2  ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cb3ovKS-cH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Trust In Me” from <em>The Jungle Book</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Mount Olympus ( Zero to Hero ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1h0i6Wd0Pw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>“Zero To Hero” from <em>Hercules&nbsp;</em></figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="Disney SpeedStorm - Toon Village ( Mickey Mouse! ) Track Music" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OC5D0VouHRk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The theme from The Mickey Mouse Club from the 50s</figcaption></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both are fueled by microtransactions instead of up-front price tags. Half of my Xbox Series S drive is already taken up with <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>, while <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and <em>Metaphor Refantazio</em> are obliterating my PlayStation 5 storage.

<p>The Counter-Strike 2 maps are a big reason why the tactical shooter has retained its spot as the most popular multiplayer game on Steam for years. Valve has meticulously rotated maps in and out of the active duty pool for over a decade, keeping the gameplay grind fresh and giving maps time time to be remade.</p>



<p>But which CS2 maps are the best?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-maps">Best CS2 maps</h2>



<h3 id="h-mirage">Mirage</h3>



<p>Mirage is the pillar of consistency in the Counter-Strike map pool. It is the only map that has not received a major rework since it was first added in 2013, and it’s the only map that has been featured in the pool at every single Major. It’s a balanced map that provides several different approaches to both the T-side and CT-side players, with plenty of opportunities for AWP play and coordinated smoke executes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-ancient">Ancient</h3>



<p>Ancient is only a few years old, and doesn’t have the same longevity as some of Counter-Strike’s most iconic maps, but it’s one of the best additions to the map pool in years. It’s one of the most fun maps to watch and play, given the breakneck pace that both the CT-side and T-side teams need to play at to control areas like Mid and the B Ramp.</p>



<h3 id="h-train">Train</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Train’s unique map design has had players chomping at the bit for it to eventually return to CS2 in November 2024. Not only did it arrive with a fresh coat of paint, but with a number of gameplay improvements, including cleaned up areas around the bombsites that allow for much easier calling and wider angles. The core gameplay ideas are still there, but the changes allow new ideas to be used as well. Welcome back, Train.</p>



<h3 id="h-overpass">Overpass</h3>



<p>Overpass was the first Counter-Strike map designed by Valve <a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2014/04/9284/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for competitive play in mind</a>, and it shows. This map gives a little bit of everything: areas that reward patience or fast-paced play, and sites that can be held or retook with clear communication. Alongside Train, Overpass is a map that Counter-Strike fans and pros cannot wait to see return to the active duty map pool.</p>
