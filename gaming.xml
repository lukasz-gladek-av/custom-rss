Bah, it's never fun writing one of these, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cyan-worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> have laid off 12 of its staff members this week, supposedly cutting the studio by about half. Cyan shared the news on its social media accounts yesterday, noting that "industry conditions" have "forced" the studio to "weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The post also states that it has been communicating with the entire team about the "choppy waters" it has been in, and that the layoffs weren't a surprise for the team, so it sounds like it has been a long time coming. At the very least those affected will be getting severance packages, but I imagine that's not quite enough consolation. Also worth noting is that the studio's current priority is to "secure financing for our next project."

Cyan are a long-running developer, having been founded almost 40 years ago. They're obviously best known as the studio behind Myst and Riven, having focused on remakes of both titles in recent years. The latter was just released last year, and was broadly well received, so you have to wonder what went wrong. Plenty of indie studios are struggling to find funding at the moment, but it's not always as simple as something as that, as we all know. For what it's worth, Cyan did also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyan.com/post/3llhcingbwb27">provide a list of employees impacted by the layoffs</a> to help them get new work.
</p>
<p>
I really do hope Cyan manages to pull through, and that all the laid off staff manage to land on their feet. Honestly, I can't think of another developer with half as much history, let alone 37 years of it. Fingers crossed for all those involved.

Have you been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a>? Not like, literally, everywhere, but Everywhere, that sort of Roblox, sort of Fortnite, everything game from Build A Rocket Boy, a studio founded by ex-Rockstar dev and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies. That whole, uh, interactive experience or whatever you want to call it still seems to be in beta. But the first project spun off from it, MindsEye, a near-future action game that really just looks like slightly sci-fi GTA, now has a release date: June 10th, later this year. Except, I'm a little bit confused by it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
MindsEye was first formally revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-boss-unveils-mindseye-a-new-blockbuster-available-in-robloxlike-everywhere">back in 2023</a>, and was meant to, firstly, be episodic, and secondly, be available in Everywhere. As it currently stands, though, it looks like you'll be able to pick it up on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox solo. The game's <a href="https://ioi.dk/MindsEye">official website</a> makes no mention of Everywhere, nor does its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/">Steam page</a>, which is pretty sparse overall. Hell, one of its key selling points is that you're meant to be able to use all the assets featured in MindsEye to make your own games in Everywhere, but I have no idea if that will be possible now.

<p>
This latest trailer introduces you to the city the game takes part in, but it's all cutscenes, and the only gameplay trailer that's been released was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSn42TbRngY&amp;ab_channel=MindsEye">from a month ago</a>, which doesn't really show you how it plays, outside of looking like a GTA clone. Sure, there's a release date, but this thing feels like borderline vapourware.
</p>
<p>
It could always be that publisher IO Interactive (you know, those folks that make Hitman) wanted Build A Rocket Boy to get something out the door to start bringing in some money. That would just be conjecture though, don't hold me to it. Honestly, I'm a bit baffled by this whole game. I'll be on the lookout for one of those lengthy walls of text explaining how the game has been delayed because the devs really want to polish it up so you can have the best experience.
</p>
<p>
I should also mention that there were some concerns over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everywhere-devs-respond-to-nft-speculation-saying-its-built-on-unreal-engine-5-not-the-blockchain">Everywhere utilising blockchain technology</a>, in no small part thanks to the fact that Build A Rocket Boy was literally hiring for people to join its blockchain team. The studio claimed Everywhere wouldn't be using it, and that it was just for research purposes. I can't see any evidence of it in MindsEye right now, but I'd probably hold off on pre-ordering this one all the same, given its mysterious, slightly off-putting vibe.

            <p>Blizzard is reportedly considering dropping the "2" from its squad-based first-person shooter sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A leak purporting to share details of the shooter's 16th season not only gives us an early peek at what's coming in the new season - as well as a Gundam collaboration - but also claims Overwatch 2 skins will be renamed "Valorous", and Overwatch 1 skins as "Classic", leading some players to believe Blizzard may be about to retire the sequel's name.</p>

<p>Twitter user SkaVorah, who shared the leaked images, said: "Skin names changed. Overwatch 1 -&gt; Classic. Overwatch 2 -&gt; Valorous.</p>
<p>"Say goodbye to 'Overwatch 2', I guess. Looks like they are dropping the '2'. This suggests that the overwatch 2 name may be retired."</p>
<p>The leak is accompanied by a handful of images that purportedly depict Overwatch 2's S16 main screen, Juno Mythic, new Mythic aspects, and reveal an upcoming collab with Gundam.</p>
<p>As with most leaks, for now, all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour until Activision Blizzard confirms one way or the other. Either way, though, it's once again got players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jmbcuq/comment/mkc5qpl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">talking</a> about whether or not live-service games like Overwatch or Destiny should simply keep evolving rather than develop stand-alone "sequels".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for comment and will update as/when we hear back.</p>
<p>Last month we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-bringing-loot-boxes-back-two-years-after-they-were-removed-from-the-series">Blizzard is reimplementing loot boxes into Overwatch 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-loot-boxes-will-be-withdrawn-from-sale-at-the-end-of-the-month">a little over two years after the team removed them from Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard detailed its plans for what the studio calls "one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s most significant years so far", including a brief look at Overwatch 2 season 15, which is set to debut later this month, on 18th February. It is this season that will see those aforementioned loot boxes make their return to the hero shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/637717/assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-assassinations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I realized quite late in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em> that being this version of a shinobi is hard — but it was precisely the precision the game demanded that made it all the more rewarding.</p><p>With <em>Shadows</em>, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise has achieved both its most impressive stealth and assassination mechanics. At its best, <em>Shadows</em> evokes games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13719322/dishonored-2-immersive-sim-serious-game-melodrama">Arkane’s <em>Dishonored</em> series</a>, mixing emergent action with an artful blend of skills and scenarios. While not nearly at the level of sophistication as those games, I nevertheless had moments that left me breathless from what I could achieve. These put me more in the space of immersive simulated assassination games than the most recent, chest-thumping<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games.</p><p>Here’s an example. In Ubisoft’s open-world third-person action game, I was faced with a group of about 10 men in a dark cave, all of whom turned out to be targets I’d been hunting for ages. They were all part of one group, who I’d been carefully taking down individually — one leading me to the next. Now, after tracking one, it turned out he and his remaining colleagues had decided to hold a meeting. Together. With their guards. I hadn’t planned this, but now I either had to leave or use this opportunity to finish the job in one lethal swoop.</p><p>Importantly, my character, the shinobi Naoe, was not without her own tricks to balance the overwhelming odds. First, she wasn’t alone. In <em>Shadows</em>, you organically recruit allies throughout your massive revenge quest. You can summon them at a moment’s notice to assist you in any scenario: from a barefisted fighter monk to a giggling, creepy teenage poisoner. Having “upgraded” my poisoner, her poison bomb put three enemies to sleep immediately. Her upgrades also meant anyone who came to investigate fell under the same spell. I began by summoning said poisoner to take out several of the targets and guards.</p><p>Second, Naoe herself has skills that verge on magical, such as slowing down time while moving at normal speed — again, reminiscent of <em>Dishonored</em> or Arkane’s other big hitter, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc">Deathloop</a></em>. Using this skill immediately after my poisoner allowed me to throw several deadly kunai at guards’ heads and move closer to the actual targets for a slick close-up double assassination.</p><p>All of this happened within less than 20 seconds. And voila! All the targets and their guards were down.</p><p>Never had I felt more like an assassin in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. It surprised me, given that I have been playing the franchise since the first game. But this moment made me realize that I had never had to be this clever before in these games, or had access to such a variety of complementary skills, tools, and abilities. Even the more recent trilogy of “reboots” — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16414638/assassins-creed-origins-ancient-egypt-hands-on-open-world-exploration"><em>Origins</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/1/17921552/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Odyssey</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/12/21319059/assassins-creed-valhalla-hands-on-preview-pc-xbox-one-ps4-gameplay-ubisoft-rpg"><em>Valhalla</em></a> — did not feature such variety and complementary actions. While the lovable goofball protagonists of those games develop god-like abilities, most were centered around combat rather than stealth. The last expansion of <em>Valhalla</em>, for example, literally saw you play a god, Odin, battling through the Norse realms to save his son, Baldur.</p><p>Now, with <em><em>Shadows</em></em>, Ubisoft has managed to balance both action and stealth, allowing you to play as the shinobi Naoe and the lethal mountain samurai Yasuke. It’s Naoe’s stealth, in particular, that has left me impressed. <em>Shadows</em> creates multiple scenarios that require planning for your shinobi. While Naoe moves like dark silk on a night wind and can instantly assassinate multiple targets, she can die quickly. Yet, she will often face large set pieces with upward of 20–30 enemies patrolling an area.</p><p>The game places huge rewards in, for example, giant, heavily guarded castles. Walking in the front gate is almost never an option. But Naoe can climb overhanging trees, find cracks in walls, and swim in via aqueducts. Once inside, she can use “eagle vision” to see through walls and tag enemies. <em>Shadows </em>removes the flying companion from the previous three games, which acted like a military drone to provide air reconnaissance.</p><p>Now, it’s entirely within the limited confines of Naoe’s vision — but that’s not necessarily limiting. If used properly, Naoe can never be surprised and can plan the order of assassination such that no one ever realizes she has infiltrated. For example, if one guard is patrolling, it could be easier to take him out, rather than his colleagues who are stationed, since he may spot you moving.</p><p>The size of these places turns this into a murdery puzzle. If I take Guard A out, I have access to Guards B and C. However, Guard D is watching Guard A, etc. Without realizing it, you have to create an assassination Rube Goldberg machine, taking one out, then another, timing it and using different abilities, recruits, and so on. It takes some time to get through these giant castles, but you’re rewarded with some of the best weapons and armor in the game. And if you’re caught, you are hunted for a while, making traversal a hazard. In previous entries, stealth was largely optional and functional but unremarkable. There was also no real penalty for being spotted that those godlike protagonists couldn’t easily silence.</p><p>Similarly, the other playable character, the samurai Yasuke, requires careful consideration, despite being a moving mountain. He doesn’t have eagle vision. He is made for loud lethality; even his instant assassinations sever heads and limbs. This creates its own thoughtful play since you need to carefully move and work your way through these large set pieces, ideally without drawing attention.</p><p>Yasuke’s advantage is that he can use a huge bow to take enemies out instantly from a distance — unlike Naoe, who has to be close. This speaks to the give-and-take theme central to the game’s mechanics. But Yasuke can more easily and quickly end alerts, making his style of murder puzzle less clean but easier to recover from should things go awry.</p><p>I did not expect <em>Shadows</em> to place so much work and thought into its assassinations, which is obviously amusing given the name of the franchise. Having played this series since its inception, I was struck by the emphasis on clean, thoughtful assassinations — not only within scripted contexts, but in the open world itself.</p><p>After years of trending toward bombastic action, <em>Shadows</em> points toward a future where <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> continues to live up to its name — and hopefully creates scenarios to make players feel like the titular leads, rather than god-like warriors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate remains a lovely panel to work and play on, just like its predecessor. And the keyboard and trackpad are overall very good. My biggest gripe with the keyboard is the new column of macro keys on the right, which often causes me to mute the microphone when I mean to hit the right arrow. It’s yet another problem that could have been avoided by using the standard inverted-T arrow key arrangement that’s easier to find by feel. Are Windows laptop makers ever going to learn?</p><p>The thinner and lighter chassis is a welcome change (it shaves off a whole 7mm and 0.8 pounds), though I need to do more thermal testing to see if it’s as good at cooling as the last model. There’s also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24350342/razer-laptop-cooling-pad-review-hyperboost-synapse-rgb">Razer’s Laptop Cooling Pad</a>, which can give the Blade 16’s GPU and CPU up to 25W more power each. I have it here, so I’ll see if HyperBoost is worth the added noise and extra $150. I also wonder whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336394/asus-rog-strix-scar-16-18-specs-price-ces-2025">thicker gaming laptops</a> might eke out more juice from the RTX 5090.</p><div id=":Rebdcer6:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Razer Blade 16 (right) is noticeably thinner than the last-gen 4090 model (left).</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The keyboard deck is slightly deeper on the new model (right).</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Blade 16 thankfully maintains the same plethora of ports.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>I know we’re only talking a difference in thickness of just 7mm, but you definitely feel it.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>As I’ve <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/637898/nvidia-rtx-5090-laptop-gpu-impressions-benchmarks-testing-specs">already written</a>, the RTX 5090 GPU in the Blade 16 is a fine upgrade if you enjoy DLSS and frame generation. I’m going to continue testing it, including more gaming while on battery power. Nvidia’s made some <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-gaming-laptops-start-at-1299/">big claims</a> about how powerful yet power-efficient the 50-series laptop cards are, and in my early testing, the 5090 <em>is</em> about 20 percent more efficient than the 4090, so I’m intrigued. </p><p>But I’m skeptical, because when I’m not gaming, the Blade 16 struggles to get through a basic work day on battery, even while using productivity apps like Slack, Chrome, and Google Docs on the integrated graphics. Its AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 “Strix Point” CPU can easily stretch beyond eight hours of work in other gaming laptops, like the 2024 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24324299/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-gaming-laptop-review-amd-strix-point">Asus ROG Zephyrus G16</a>, but I can’t get five and a half hours with the Blade, despite enabling Advanced Optimus and triple-checking the graphics settings in Nvidia Control Panel, Windows Settings, <em>and</em> Synapse. (Maybe there’s something misconfigured <em>somewhere</em>, so I’ll continue testing this too.)</p><p>This laptop is supposed to be great for productivity, creative apps, <em>and </em>gaming. It costs four-and-a-half <em>thousand</em> dollars. Part of me really likes what it has to offer, and I’m downright impressed with how cool it can run under load, but another part of me thinks the price is outlandish if things are randomly crashing under light loads and you have to charge multiple times a day. For that money, you can buy a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">$2,000 MacBook Pro</a> that can handle creative workflows and last well over a whole day (if you don’t mind MacOS, of course). And you’d have another $2,500 to spend on a respectable gaming laptop, or even a more powerful desktop.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Green-illuminated lid logo aside, the Blades continue to look sleek and fit in anywhere.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>However, I’ll concede that having one device to do it all is a slick proposition. I keep coming back to how nice this laptop looks and feels. And boy does it make games look pretty and run them smoothly, either on its brilliant OLED or on an external 4K monitor. It is, after all, meant for games.</p><p>I can still see myself loving the Blade 16. But we’ll have to see in the full review, after a whole bunch more testing that’s hopefully (fingers crossed) devoid of any further technical hangups.</p><p>What do you think? Does any laptop actually make sense for nearly five grand? Let me know in the comments, and if there’s anything in particular you’d like to see tested on the Blade 16 for the full review.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

But a new look at an improved gameplay feature in the upcoming remake, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, might just be enough to convert this jaded fan who’s convinced the series peaked at <em>Sons of Liberty</em>. In a 12-second clip, Naked Snake can be seen swapping his camo from a foresty look to something more suitable for an urban environment in record time. It’s way faster and less cumbersome-looking than the camo-swapping of the original.  - Claire Jackson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-camo-feature-new-1851772814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-camo-feature-new-1851772814">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase's surreal co-op horror, Once Human, is offering a range of goodies to tempt back lapsed players.</p>
<p>With the cross-platform mobile port set to launch next month, NetEase has emailed abandoned Once Human accounts to suggest it's "time to return", and offering "10+ cosmetics and 40,000 Starchrom" as a login bonus.</p>

<p>The email also stressed that one of the game's key launch features - server resets - can now be circumvented now, with "non-shutdown server" options available. Introduced earlier this month, these servers allow players to stay on if they'd prefer not to move on and start over when their scenario has finished.</p>
<p>"When the scenario ends afters it settlement phase, Metas can choose to remain on the server, return to Eternaland, or sign up for a new scenario," NetEase explained.</p>
<p>"Following the addition of Non-Shutdown Servers, anyone who hasn't logged in to Once Human in 30 days will be moved to Eternaland during the transition and can return when the next scenario goes live."</p>
<p>That's not all, either. Cross-character sharing has also been introduced to permit players to share resources across characters on the same account, including Blueprints, mods, weapon accessories, and cosmetics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-humans-cross-platform-test-is-now-underway-heres-how-to-play">After cross-platform tests for PC and mobile last month</a>, Once Human's mobile port - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">back in September</a> - launches on 23rd April 2025.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter held it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates, and I was one of those players that fell off after the server reset.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-concept-art-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>20 new concept art images for Battlefield 6 have leaked online following a slew of people datamining the game.</p>



<p>The concept arts where uploaded to the 1|BF telegram channel and made their way to the Battlefield Reddit. You can see all of the images below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As pointed out by many of the users in the comments, the concept arts give off a very “gritty” vibe, something that players believe Battlefield 2042 failed to capture.</p>



<p>It appears that the leaks originated from datamining the game from the Battlefield Labs playtests, which started earlier this month for the first time.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/">Images and videos of the next Battlefield game</a> have also been uploaded on masse and EA has been trying to DMCA the content as fast as possible. However, if you look on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield reddit</a> or if you’re in a discord server, you’re almost certainly guaranteed to still find them. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 (or whatever its called) is scheduled to release between April 1st 2025 – March 31st 2026, with most company’s waiting on the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/if-gta-6-delayed-tank-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 to make a decision on when to release</a>.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Insider Gaming exclusively reported that the next Battlefield game is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to have a free-to-play Battle Royale component</a> in development by Ripple Effect. At the time of writing, EA is yet to make an announcement, but Insider Gaming understands that its still the plan to release.</p>



<p>According to sources, EA has “learned their lesson” when it comes to such an experience and the company wants to replicate the success of Call of Duty and Warzone, which proved to be tremendously successful. </p>



<p>What do you think of the Battlefield 6 concept images? Will you be picking up the game? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

		<p>It definitely feels like spring has sprung… again this week. It’s been nice and sunny to cut through some of the chill, there’s been a little bit of mizzle, and now the clocks are going to jump forward this week, much to the delight of cats and dogs around the country that are going to get fed an hour early tomorrow (or more realistically, on Monday).</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s</strong> is jumping into Atomfall this weekend, but while twiddling thumbs through the last few days before its release, he played a ton of&nbsp;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and sees many more hours ahead with the game – he upgraded it to Afterbirth as well – and played a bit of The Tainted Grail : Fall of Avalon demo, which he says it “a promising Skyrim-alike old-school RPG with some janky combat but great atmosphere.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead, even if it’s only 47 hours long!</p>

            <p>
If you've been itching for an excuse to get back out on the road again - by which I mean to sit in front of the computer playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> again - there's some good news. Developer SCS Software has announced its latest state expansion - this one providing access to the highways and byways of Missouri - launches next Thursday, 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
Missouri, if you haven't been keeping tabs, brings American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 17, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and Arkansas. It's not the only expansion waiting in the wings, either; SCS has also previously confirmed it's working in Illinois, Iowa, and Lousiana - although these are further out.
</p>
<p>
Back to Missouri, though, American Truck Simulator's digital rendition of the Show Me State promises "vibrant cities" - including Saint Louis and its iconic Gateway Arch - as well as "diverse and beautiful" vistas, "from the rolling Ozark hills to charming small towns and vast farmlands."

"Experience the beauty of Missouri's sunrise and sunset as you drive through this picturesque landscape," SCS writes over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730870/American_Truck_Simulator__Missouri/">the expansion's Steam page</a>. "New depots and underground warehouses typical for this state add depth and realism to your trucking adventures. Engage in the heartbeat of Missouri's agriculture, transporting farm produce amidst fresh crops and rural vibes. Whether you're navigating urban streets in Saint Louis or cruising through serene countryside, Missouri offers a diverse and exciting trucking experience."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Missouri's 3rd April arrival on Steam, SCS Software has released American Truck Simulator's 1.54 update. This introduces an overhauled cargo system - which the developer says "improves efficiency [and] saves disk space and memory by eliminating the need to store countless pre-made combinations" - and there's a more intuitive truck adjustment system, making it easier to tweak your in-cabin experience.
</p>
<p>
That's on top of NVIDIA PhysX physics implementation, which promises "more precise collision detection results and more robust behaviour during scenarios involving collisions", plus Driving Academy awards, and more - as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/537723186574262495?l=english">detailed in SCS' patch notes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s Friday, which means there should be a fresh new episode of <em>Severance </em>waiting for you when you get home from your un-severed job. But alas, season two is over. That we’re eagerly awaiting more instead of breathing a sigh of relief is a testament to the show’s quality. Despite the weight of years’ worth of expectations, season two strode more than it stumbled. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we reflect on the highs and lows of a good TV show.</p><p>We begin the episode by briefly talking about our true passion, shirts, before elegantly segueing into a conversation about Ubisoft’s extremely eventful week: The embattled publisher announced that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637775/ubisoft-tencent-carveout-assassins-creed-far-cry-tom-clancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinning off its most successful series</a>, including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>, into a separate subsidiary thanks to a $1.25 billion investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent. What does this mean for those remaining aboard the Ubisoft mothership? And will this lead to even more heads rolling following layoffs and studio closures in December?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the AI abomination of the week</a>: an image filter based on the works of Studio Ghibli, whose most famous creative, Hayao Miyazaki, once called AI “an insult to life itself.” After that, we give our final appraisal of <a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Severance </em>season two</a>, which was not perfect, but which managed to hit some impressive high notes and benefited from largely focusing on characters over mystery box shenanigans. Gita doesn’t love Ben Stiller’s directorial style, and Riley doesn’t think <em>Severance </em>is necessarily a Smart Show, but those things don’t prevent it from being good, if that makes sense. If it doesn’t, listen to the episode!&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we come up with a simple solution to the problem of mass media illiteracy: change all of society. Seems like something we can knock out in a day or two, so let’s get cracking.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can follow in the footsteps of the many, many <em>Severance </em>recap podcasts and create After-Aftermath Hours, in which we’ll provide essential commentary about our own show mere moments after it airs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Why do we think the show became so zeitgeisty this season, but not during season one? Why did it become the show everyone was talking about every week this season?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think we needed something, especially right now. At least there was one bright spot that I could rely on in the last ten weeks. And I think the long, long wait for it [played a role].</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I think that’s true. People discovered it during the three-year break, and then they realized [how good it is]. I was watching the first season week to week, so I was having the same experience everyone else had three years ago, where I was screaming, crying, throwing up waiting for each new episode of <em>Severance</em>. But I do think part of it is also, a lot of the analysis of the first show assumes it was about anticapitalist politics. I do not know if I agree with that assessment now, having seen the second season. But I do think it’s a show about alienation – about the ways we are alienated from ourselves and why we do it and what it does to us. I think that is just a very common state of being in our world, especially right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’ve trained Instagram to only show me cat videos and anticapitalist memes, and one of the memes that pops up a lot is this idea of everyone feeling alienated from what they do but not connecting the dots and recognizing that capitalism is the problem, so they just blame individual issues. They say “I hate my job” or “I hate Mondays.” I think that something like <em>Severance </em>– because it is not explicitly anticapitalist – can appeal to those people too, even the ones who are like “I would never take the name of capitalism in vain, though I do hate everything about my life.” Those people can watch <em>Severance </em>and agree with it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>It is Marx’s theory of alienation for babies, in a lot of ways. The visual metaphor is so useful. I think that is really what people have latched onto: the idea that when you go to work, you are a different person, and you are not supposed to bring things from the outside world to work with you in service of the machine that you are working for. But also, that’s literally impossible. That is just not possible to do! Eventually you will reintegrate. There will be bleed-through. You’ll be dozing. It is a function of being in our modern world that makes us feel like we are separated into different pieces, and in order to be a healthy person, you have to bring those pieces together.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I found what seems to be Lumon’s ultimate plan to be compelling in the grand scheme of all of that. It appears that what they’re trying to do is make it so that you can avoid any unpleasant moment or anything that would feel inefficient. Meanwhile, the people who are ruling over us right now are trying to make everything <a href="https://doge.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as “efficient” as possible</a>, tech bros are all about automating everything, and then we’ve got Lumon creating an innie for when you use the fucking bathroom. Getting rid of every bit of friction in your life no matter what it is. It feels like the show really called what all these people are going for.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> The Ghibli AI stuff is an example of that. “I can be a good artist without having to do any of the work of being an artist. I can draw like Miyazaki without putting in the hundreds of thousands of hours of training that he did in order to learn how to draw like that.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Now we’re also starting to see the tangible downsides of that. You hear about people who’ve become reliant on ChatGPT and who suck at all those soft skills or hard skills they’ve offloaded onto it. I’ve even seen people be like “Man, not gonna lie, even typing things into ChatGPT is really hard.” That’s the end result of all of this: If you remove every last bit of friction, you wind up with a person who’s this inert blob who cannot really do anything and who is no longer a contributing member of society – or an interesting person to interact with.&nbsp;</p><p>And then at that point, why be a human? Why exist? What is the point of your life if you’ve automated all of it? Because then, you really have made the case that you should be replaced by robots – not that we all should. But you <em>have </em>replaced yourself with robots, so what are you doing here?&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future"><h3>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For</h3></a><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ahead of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s official unveiling at the upcoming Star Wars Celebration in April</a>, images from the the turn-based tactics game from Respawn Entertainment and Bit Reactor have appeared online. The XCOM influences are abundant, which is unsurprising given <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/bitreactor-has-a-star-wars-tactical-strategy-game-in-the-works-15-xcom-veterans-on-its-team-and-an-ambitious-vision-for-the-future-of-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the number of XCOM veterans</a> at Bit Reactor.</p>







<p>The images were first <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered by gaming news outlet MP1st,</a> who found the images within a Bit Reactor artist’s portfolio. The gameplay shown is reportedly dated to mid-2023, when the game went by the internal code name Bruno.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screenshots show gameplay very reminiscent of the tactical, turn-based squad combat genre that XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2 revitalized in the 2010s. In this kind of game, the player controls a squad of characters in turn-based combat, where each character has a limited number of actions and moves they can make. Even the iconic Mario franchise dipped its toes into the turn-based tactics genre with Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle and Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope.</p>



<p>The images of gameplay show the player controlling a Mandalorian character and targeting a Republic clone trooper, with a “95% hit chance” window above the enemy trooper. The window at the bottom of the screen shows a number of other combat actions the player could take, including the use of a thermal detonator (the Star Wars equivalent of a powerful grenade). Another images shows players using an ability taken straight from XCOM: overwatch. When a player activates overwatch on their turn, they wait for an enemy to move into their line of sight and fire automatically. An animated image also shows a makeshift headquarters, where the player can interact with an Armory, Holotable, Special Ops, or Black Market.</p>



<p>Respawn has been collaborating with Bit Reactor on the Star Wars tactical game project. The developers of the critically acclaimed Jedi series were previously working on a Star Wars shooter about a Mandalorian bounty hunter, before that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project was canceled in February 2024</a>. </p>

            <p>
After Netflix's tentative first few years in games - which has seen it grow its mobile library, acquire studios, and dabble in triple-A development before dramatically changing course - the streamer's new gaming boss, Alain Tascan, has laid out the company's latest vision. This, he says, is less about the console model and more about phone-controlled party games.
</p>
<p>
Tascan - a 30-year industry veteran who most recently served as executive vice president of game development at Epic Games - joined Netflix last July, taking over the role from Mike Verdu, who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">briefly transitioned to vice president of generative AI at Netflix</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-netflix-gaming-boss-departs-following-move-to-ai-role">departing the company</a>. And with nine months at the streaming service now under his belt, Tascan recently outlined his vision for Netflix gaming at this year's GDC.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the">reported by The Game Business
</a>, that vision takes a four-pronged approach, focusing on narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a trusted destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller.
</p>
<p>
The latter, as Tascan sees it, is Netflix's attempt at Wii-style industry "disruption". "I love the Wii," he told The Game Business. "I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can. I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense... But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive... Waiting for a game to download... I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible."
</p>
<p>
As such, it's perhaps not surprising to hear Tascan's dismissal of the classic console model. "[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic," he said. "Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you're thinking about high definition, you're thinking about the controller... If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us."
</p>
<p>
Tascan also seems unconvinced classic console-style games have much value for Netflix - which might go some way to explaining why the streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">recently culled staff at respected Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>, and why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">closed its high-profile triple-A studio</a> before it could release a game last year. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games?," he posited to The Game Business. "There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting... What do we give [Netflix subscribers], and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"
</p>
<p>
The answer to that question is, apparently, party games. "I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," Tascan explained. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen... if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"
</p>
<p>
"We need to push the vision more than anything else and try to disrupt," he continued, "because I believe the threshold you need to hit for people to be entertained by games is very high... In terms of the disruption we can bring, distribution is one and the other is the phone as a controller. The communication between the phone and the TV. The IP. The transmedia aspect... I don't know exactly which one will work, but we have a few cards to play that are very unique."
</p>
<p>
"We have some very special competitive advantages," Tascan added. "We've just scratched the surface. For instance, for Squid Game, you watch the show and you unlock some currency in the game. But that's just the beginning. Imagine places where you watch something and then something special appears in the game, and maybe in the future you do something in the game and then you watch something – because of AI or what have you – and something happens there. We have a lot of things that we can imagine and reimagine."
</p>
<p>
No matter how Tascan's vision of mobile-driven party games, unlockable currency, and "AI or what have you" pans out, he insists Netflix is in the gaming business for the long haul. "If you look at our two co-CEOs... and look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business... they know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it... I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there's no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular... I believe in their full commitment."

"But we also had the visible references from movies and shows like in Solo: A Star Wars Story. We also had our own inspiration, of course, to create this new variant of Sabacc that's somewhat like Blackjack in terms of its simplicity and emergent choices. We also took some inspiration from dice games like 421 and Yahtzee. So basically, simple games of chance, where you still have to make micro strategic decisions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prototyping this iteration of Sabacc before introducing it into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> took some time, but they found that much of the design work came from outside the game: on a normal table. Siraudin mentioned that by building up Kessel Sabacc, the developers repurposed standard playing cards and modified their rules on the fly to narrow down their game version.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So the good thing about designing a card game is that it's super easy to prototype, you can actually do it with just normal cards, and so all of those rules and decisions were made with that kind of setup, and It made our iteration really, really fast," he said. "We play-tested each version, and we would change the ruleset in real-time because it was like, 'Okay, this sucks now, let's change that.'&nbsp; We chose the version that we felt confident of this ruleset's inherent fun and simplicity, but it still lacked depth and strategy. We introduced shift tokens, which are action cards and a nod to the previous ruleset which included a similar shift mechanic."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/pentiment-director-explains-how-going-all-in-on-fonts-helped-elevate-the-medieval-detective-rpg-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Pentiment director explains how going all-in on fonts helped elevate the medieval Detective RPG.</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Living that Scoundrel Life">Living that Scoundrel Life</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once the core mechanics of Kessel Sabacc were complete, the developers began work on building up the other features and the experience—which was about getting players to feel like a proper scoundrel. The developers' approach to presenting Kessel Sabacc within the game world was to use diegetic storytelling and presentation to properly immerse players in the setting and get them in the mood.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the designer explained in the panel, "We want Sabacc to be part of the underworld, and especially have it fit that theme, which meant for us various degrees of discoverability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When playing Kessel Sabacc in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, protagonist Kay and her tiny companion Nix join a table and face other players—within the game world rather than transporting players to a separate screen or isolated space. This adds a cinematic feeling to the mini-game and makes playerss aware of the other players and their cards, as cheating and bluffing is a major part of the game. Players can even call upon their companion to sneak around the table to peek at the cards of rival players—at the risk of being seen and subsequently placed under suspicion for the rest of the round.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-your-next-game-needs-a-babygirl" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why your next game needs a babygirl</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the nature of Kessel Sabacc and the scoundrel fantasy, it was quite appropriate to learn that the developers also played a trick on players when presenting the game. According to Siraudin, Kessel Sabacc is a 2D game, with a UI placed over the animated visuals of the scoundrels sitting at their table—all with the goal of adding a heightened sense of clarity and immersion for the mini-game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew that in the long run, it would benefit us [to make the pace faster] because players would be willing to engage a bit more with this activity," said Siraudin. "We talked about the game, but it's time to reveal the truth because Sabacc is actually a 2D game. Why do I say that? Because all of the gameplay and interactions you see in the game are actually on the UI layer, on top of everything else. I often said that Sabacc is truly a 2D game, which is really cool. [...] I focused on two main ideas for the UI design: the idea of it being a toy and the importance of players feeling responsive and fidgeting with it. Also, focus on clarity to create context for every choice you make."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Upon release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earned a lot of praise for its side activities, which included the Kessel Sabacc mini-game and its underworld experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-just-added-a-shiny-mewtwo-ex-card-locked-behind-a-23-paywall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket's recent expansion, Shining Revelry, just dropped this week. And while fans are enjoying the new line-up of shiny Pokemon cards in all the colors of the rainbow, there's one that's causing some division: a shiny Mewtwo ex card that's only available to players who pay $23 in real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's what's going on: Mewtwo ex is a card that already exists in the game in several forms. It was added in the very first set, Genetic Apex, which has a "regular" version, an "immersive rare" version with Mewtwo bursting out of containment, and a "gold crown" version of Mewtwo against a gold background. All three versions have the exact same moves and power levels, so in a match, it doesn't matter which one you use. But they're all varying degrees of rare, so for those who want to "catch 'em all" so to speak, it's critical to track down all three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mewtwo ex in question here is another version of that same card, with the same effects. The difference is a cosmetic one: this Mewtwo ex is a "shiny", so it's green instead of pinkish, and has a different background. However, it also takes up a separate slot in your card collection in the "Promo" set of cards, meaning collectors need it if they want to 100% complete their collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here he is, in all his shiny glory:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/screenshot-20250328-123453-1743183331940.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot of Pokemon TCG Pocket's new Mewtwo ex card.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the card is only available through one method: by paying $22.99 in real money for a shop bundle containing Poke Gold, a bunch of other Mewtwo-themed cosmetic items (like a coin, a playmat, etc), and the card itself. There's no other way to get it, not through packs or Wonder Pick or anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are not reacting well to the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their frustration is understandable. Pokemon TCG Pocket has been out for several months now and has gone through four different expansions of varying sizes, as well as multiple events. While players who pay real money have up til now had certain advantages in terms of how fast they can grow their collections and other cosmetic rewards, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a gold bundle paywall. What's more, it's a bundle that's worth far more than the card by itself presumably would be, as it includes other items like currency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, some fans are rolling their eyes a bit at the controversy. Several have pointed out that the card is purely cosmetic - it doesn't do anything different from the other Mewtwo exes you can obtain, and if you don't toggle on a certain option in your settings, you can't even see it's missing from your collection. Others are pointing out that in the past, certain other promo cards have been locked behind having a Premium membership, which is itself a monthly paid subscription (albeit $12/mo, with other benefits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably the biggest concern from players, though, is the slippery slope of it all. If Pokemon TCG Pocket is willing to gate a Mewtwo ex this way, will it gate other cards? What if the game eventually starts locking brand new cards with new effects behind paywalls, effectively requiring players to pay money if they want that specific effect in their decks? Even though there's no sign of that happening just yet, some are still concerned that, with time, it may.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to The Pokemon Company for comment on this change, the criticism, and the possibility of future cards being behind paywalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
