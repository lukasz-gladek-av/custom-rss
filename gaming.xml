            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that it's bringing a native GeForce Now app to Steam Deck devices later this year, allowing you to access the cloud gaming subscription service on your handheld device more easily.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new app, Nvidia says Steam Deck users can look forward to "up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range" when connected to an external display.</p>

<p>It's technically already possible to access GeForce Now via your Steam Deck, but you have to use what essentially amounts to a workaround; in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May last year</a>, Nvidia released a custom script that installs Google Chrome onto your Deck, then "adds all the settings needed" for GeForce Now streaming via that browser.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Ufr9mfet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Lm9gnORb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GeForce Now app for Steam Deck will let you stream games at up to 4k and 60fps.</figcaption></figure><p>As Nvidia points out, your Steam Deck will theoretically draw less power if it's streaming a game from the cloud than if it's using its own internals, although I'd imagine Steam Deck users will want to wait for the app to land so they can see that for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you will also need a GeForce Now subscription if you want to stream games via this new app, and given that Nvidia is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025" rel="nofollow">imposing a 100-hour monthly playtime limit</a> across all of its tiers this month, that may not be a particularly enticing prospect for you.</p>

<p>Still, this seems like a pretty neat way to circumvent the Steam Deck's relatively low power, and it might even help you get past things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux" rel="nofollow"><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Steam Deck ban</a>&nbsp;(which is technically a Linux-wide ban), although given that the GeForce Now app will be Steam Deck-native, that seems a touch unlikely.</p>




<p>In any case, you'll be able to check out the native GeForce Now app for Steam Deck when it launches later this year. We don't have a full release date for it yet, so watch this space for more info.</p>

You’re probably familiar with DLSS, Nvidia’s upscaling technology that squeezes even better resolutions at higher framerates out of existing computing resources, but the company is now also touting RTX Neural Shaders which will use machine learning to compress textures and free up even more processing power for other stuff.</p><p>The 5080 and 5090 are both available later this month, while the 5070 and 5070 Ti will ship in February. Here are the prices:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>GeForce RTX 5070 - $550</li><li>GeForce RTX 5070 Ti - $ 750</li><li>GeForce RTX 5080 - $1,000</li><li>GeForce RTX 5090 - $2,000</li></ul></blockquote><p>The big thing to note here is that Nvidia is promising big results even from the low-end budget card. All cards are supposed to be twice as fast on average as their corresponding predecessors, and  Huang even claimed that this year’s $550 RTX 5070 would be as effective in practice as the previous $1,600 RTX 4090, seemingly due to machine learning and other optimizations. </p><p>At the high end, Nvidia showed a graph promising double the performance of the RTX 4090 from the newer (and only $400 more expensive) RTX 5090 across games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. The company even showed <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running at over double the framerate with full raytracing enabled, because one can never have too many frames when navigating Night City’s treacherous underworld. </p><p>But while the 5090 is a power hog, it’s not quite the hulking big boy that it’s predecessor was. The 4090 founder’s edition was a three-slot card that weighed over five pounds. The 5090 will only be two slots, allowing it to fit into more compact PC builds at launch. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-releasing-in-january-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s tough trying to follow previous efforts, but the biggest and best games in 2025 offer hope. From stellar AAA behemoths to long-time-coming remakes and remasters, there’s a lot to be excited about. However, we start from the beginning with January 2025’s biggest releases.</p>



<p>2024 continually got better, leaving us to salivate at another jaw-dropping year at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a>. Last year is in the rearview mirror, and it’s time to shine the light ahead at what’s to come. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> is lurking somewhere, ready to sweep up every award and penny from our pockets, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is camouflaged and coming for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best remake</a> crown, and there’s an FPS that could spell <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-on-xbox-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> for all of us.</p>



<p>I’m already trembling with fear at how expensive this year could be. Let’s start with January 2025, and its biggest games to set the stage for the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-games-coming-in-2025">Best Games Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>Release dates can change—even at the last second—but I feel confident in declaring these to be January’s biggest games. I’ve also provided their release dates for you to mark on your new 2025 calendar.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-january-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — January 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The kings of the Kongs. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>January 2025 is a very remaster and port-friendly month. Nevertheless, I never tire of Donkey Kong’s underrated and punishing difficulty. Nintendo is giving Donkey Kong Country Returns HD at least one more port, this time for the Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-have-seemingly-surfaced-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 rumors</a> growing—and my belief <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/we-desperately-need-the-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we need a Nintendo Switch 2</a>—this might be the last chance to collect, swing, smash, and bash in Country Returns before it finally makes way for a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-dynasty-warriors-origins-january-17">Dynasty Warriors: Origins — January 17</h3>



<figure><figcaption>I’d hate to clear up this mess. Credit to KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD</figcaption></figure>



<p>I couldn’t tell you the first thing about Dynasty Warriors: Origins—or the series. Every time I see one though, I think, “This looks fun.” Origins’ trailers and gameplay reveals boast even more obscene on-screen soldier counts and epic battles. Dynasty Warriors producer and director Tomohiko Sho told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dynasty-warriors-10000-soldiers-tokyo-game-show-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, “The team set themselves the goal of having <strong>10,000 soldiers on screen at a given time</strong>.” Even if it doesn’t quite hit this number, it looks widely impressive nonetheless.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-january-23">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth — January 23</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Every Cloud has a silver lining. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC release date</a> is one to watch. Rebirth may have already been out for nearly a year, but that’s no excuse to miss this masterpiece. It may have underperformed in sales, but I believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-deserves-more-love/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth deserved better</a>—in terms of sales and awards—and PC players are getting a superior version of the JRPG. The port features DLSS, Enhanced Textures &amp; Modeling, Improved Lighting, and VRR. Queen’s Blood has never looked so vibrant.</p>



<h3 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-january-30">Sniper Elite: Resistance — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Wait for the killcam. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a> is a rare, new AAA game in January 2025. Rebellion is back at it again with its sniper-gore-fused third-person shooter. I say gore because I’ve seen enough horrifying killcams from the franchise down the years to make me wince at the thought of them. More mission variety and creativity are promised as you seek to neutralize Germany’s secret Wunderwaffe&nbsp;weapon—and Sniper Elite: Resistance is a day one Game Pass launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man-2-january-30">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 — January 30</h3>



<figure><figcaption>That’s a big tongue. Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>One final port rounds off our biggest games of January 2025 list—Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. Spidey and Miles (and Venom) are surfing the web to the realm of computers with this polished port. Like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-marvels-spider-man-2-release-date-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Spider-Man 2 PC release</a> boasts improvements and upgrades on the original—<strong>Enhanced ray-tracing options</strong> being the news here.</p>



<hr>



<p>Strike up a conversation in the comments below, and let us know if you intend to pick up any of these releases. Is January 2025 a safe start to the year? Or is it the calm before the storm?</p>

Two of the models announced at CES today are launching immediately: the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Flemokey-p1-he-wireless-magnetic-switch-custom-gaming-keyboard">$169 Lemokey P1 HE QMK</a>, and the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Fkeychron-q6-he-qmk-wireless-custom-keyboard%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOorZKTLdh4434IkhO_9d6dmaNVrvn_6FdcAQkfdGyZkvS1bU4V4n">$229 Keychron Q6 HE QMK</a>, with three additional keyboards set to be released later this year.</p><p>Hall effect switches are notable for providing more customization features and a faster press than traditional mechanical switches, making them a popular choice for gamers. They use magnetic induction sensing on the PCB that detects how far down a key has been pushed — allowing you to decide the exact actuation point or even set different functions that activate depending on how hard you press.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lemokey P1 HE QMK is a 75 percent layout keyboard with 2.4GHz Bluetooth and a 1,000Hz polling rate. It can be used wired or wirelessly and is compatible exclusively with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keychron.com%2Fproducts%2Fgateron-double-rail-magnetic-switch">Gateron Double-Rail magnetic switches</a>. The Keychron Q6 HE also launching today is a full-sized mechanical keyboard with similar features and switch restrictions.

In fact, the Hyper Strummer isn’t compatible with the Switch at all. It only works with the 18-year-old Nintendo Wii, and the older <em>Guitar Hero</em> and <em>Rock Band</em> rhythm game titles released for that console.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRT4DRVR/?tag=theverge02-20">$76.99 Hyper Strummer</a> could have potentially been a cheaper alternative to <em>Fortnite Festival</em>-compatible guitar controllers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24155728/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-fortnite-festival-rock-band-stock-availability">PDP’s $129.99 Riffmaster</a>. But it only works with a Wiimote slotted into the back, and is not compatible with modern gaming hardware like the Xbox Series X / S or the PlayStation 5.</p><p>Its design also appears identical to the <em>Guitar Hero</em> controller Hyperkin released in 2009 during the Wii era, which <a href="https://twitter.com/kua1sude/status/1874508660455702574?s=61&amp;t=ka62_HRMDRk57zsnnVROzQ">led to accusations on X</a> that the company was repackaging and selling old stock as a new product.</p><p>Hyperkin responded to the accusations <a href="https://x.com/Hyperkin/status/1874923878964703418">with a statement shared on X</a> explaining why the Hyper Strummer looks so similar to older hardware. “While it is correct that this is the same shell mold of a previous Hyperkin release from 2009, that is all it is. We used the mold to make brand new shells, fitted with new 2024 internal components. This is not old stock, nor is it old guitars that have been sitting in a warehouse.”</p><p>The company says the modernized Hyper Strummer was “developed to meet the demand for an accessible and budget-friendly solution, perfect for retro gamers who want to enter the guitar scene in 2025 at an affordable price.”  Instead of risking buying used hardware online that potentially turns out to be non-functional, devoted <em>Guitar Hero</em> fans who have refused to upgrade their Nintendo Wiis now have another option.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <em>Call of Duty</em> maker, along with Meta and others, is accused of influencing the shooter behind that tragedy through its products. </p><p>As part of its defense and in an effort to get the lawsuit tossed out of court, Activision’s head of creative for <em>Call of Duty</em>, Patrick Kelly, revealed  budgets and sales figures for some of the company’s recent games. The information, rarely made public, includes the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> (2015): $450 million in development costs / 43 million copies sold</li><li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> (2019): $640 in development costs / 41 million copies sold</li><li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </em>(2020): $700 in development costs / 30 million copies sold</li></ul><p>While Activision did not share data for more current games, the snapshot in time suggests a trend of <em>Call of Duty</em> games getting ever more expensive to make despite selling millions fewer copies each year at only $10 more per copy (prices for most new blockbuster games went up to $70 when the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S came out in 2020). The data also points to this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, which hasn’t officially been announced yet but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is rumored to be a <em>Black Ops 2 </em>sequel</a></span>, potentially costing $1 billion in development costs alone over the life of the game (marketing costs can reach hundreds of millions more on top of that). </p><p>One way that <em>Call of Duty</em> might still be raking in more money than ever, even if it is still facing declining or stagnating sales, is through its popular crossover skins and battle passes. The post-launch lifecycle of each new game in the multiplayer series is now heavily monetized, with diehard fans spending hundreds more in addition to the base price of the game on special gun decals, emotes, and other cosmetics. </p><p>This month’s <em>Squid Game</em> event has been controversial precisely for that reason, as Activision charges premiums for skins from the hit Netflix show while also finding new things to paywall like premium event battle passes. How all of this pans out in the end-of-year financials is now impossible to know, however. All of that data went into a black box when Microsoft completed its $69 billion acquisition of the publisher back in 2023. </p><p>All we know is that last year’s entry, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-xbox-sales-ps5-1851686679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-game-pass-xbox-sales-ps5-1851686679">had the most players of any <em>Call of Duty </em>launch ever</a></span>. While a temporary boon to Microsoft’s Game Pass service, it’s unclear if the franchise’s towering budgets will be sustainable under a subscription model over the long-term. Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick had famously declined to put the company’s games on subscription services. “I don’t agree with the idea of a multi-game subscription service as a business proposition going forwards,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-ftc-trial-day-4-bobby-kotick-and-jim-ryan-game-pass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-ftc-trial-day-4-bobby-kotick-and-jim-ryan-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a></span> during an 2023 FTC trial over the merger. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Big video games take a lot of money to make, but the industry is very secretive in exactly how much is spent developing them. However, it looks like we might have some insight on how much money it takes to make and market a Call of Duty game.</p><p>In a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Activision's head Call of Duty creative Patrick Kelly reportedly revealed the total budgets and copies sold for three Call of Duty games. 2015's Black Ops III reportedly took developer Treyarch over three years to make and cost $450 million, with the total number of copies sold being 43 million.</p><p>For 2019's Modern Warfare, developed by Infinity Ward, the total cost of development was reportedly $640 million with 41 million copies sold. The last one is Black Ops Cold War from 2020. Treyarch and Raven Software's joint project reportedly took $700 million to develop and sold 30 million copies.</p><p>The court filing was reportedly filed on December 23 as part of a response to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uvalde-families-file-lawsuit-against-activision-and-meta/1100-6523731/" data-ref-id="1100-6523731">lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard</a> regarding the Robb Elementary shooting in Uvalde, Texas back in 2022. The Uvalde lawsuit was filed in May 2024 and claimed that Call of Duty played a part in influencing the mass shooter. Kelly reportedly cited those three specific Call of Duty games as they were the ones that the survivors claimed the shooter played.</p><p>The video game industry still remains tight-lipped about development budgets. In 2023, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-and-horizon-forbidden-west-budgets-revealed-by-accident-and-they-werent-cheap/1100-6515551/" data-ref-id="1100-6515551">document surfaced</a> that showed Sony spent $220 million to develop The Last of Us Part 2 and $212 million for Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

                <p>Razer has announced a new dock for mobile gaming devices: the Razer Handheld Dock Chroma. Described as a versatile hub that can transform mobile devices into gaming consoles for your TV, it features a six-in-one I/O design. Preorders are now open for the device ahead of its launch on January 30 at $80.</p><p>According to Razer, the dock is equipped with a gigabit ethernet port, multiple USB connections, and HDMI out.

new dock is one of several announcements from Razer today at CES 2025. Other highlights include the Razer Blade 16 laptop--an ultra-thin gaming device equipped with a 240Hz OLED display and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. Other interesting reveals include the new PC Remote Play feature coming to the Razer Nexus mobile app--this will let users stream PC gameplay directly to their iOS and Android mobile devices--and Project Arielle, a gaming chair that features integrated heating and cooling technology.</p><p>Using the Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair as a base, Project Arielle uses a bladeless fan system to efficiently deliver an adjustable airflow to its user. Other new Razer products on the way include RGB light bars that offer both front-facing and rear-projecting lighting options, the Iskur V2 X gaming chair priced at $300, and the 19.7-inch Razer Monitor Stand that is equipped with built-in USB and HDMI ports.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin has said their warm-hearted series of sci-fi video games will end with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>, which releases 31st January. However, Citizen Sleeper as a series of games won't necessarily end there.</p>
<p>The intention, as Martin laid it out to me in a recent interview, is to create a full tabletop role-playing version of the game, and thereby handover future adventures in the series to the TTRPG space that has so inspired it.</p>

<p>Responding to whether that would be it for Citizen Sleeper games after the sequel, Martin replied: "I think it is for video games. I'll leave myself a backdoor somewhere that I can climb through and dig it out the grave again... But no. I think especially the ending - and I hope people feel this when they reach the ending - I really felt like, okay, this is me saying the final word on it. I really like where I'm leaving it. I'm really happy with that.</p><p>"But Citizen Sleeper has meant a lot to a lot of people and so I'm not about to leave that behind," they added. "The next big project for me will be to work on a Citizen Sleeper tabletop game in full, but I need to find the right collaborator and I need to work that out, and I need to do that alongside other stuff. So that's something that will be a more long-term project."</p>
<p>Martin has collaborated on tabletop projects before. Their game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lonearchivist/iow-tidebreak">In Other Waters was adapted for tabletop via a collaboration by Lone Archivist</a>, and <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/cyclesoftheeye">Citizen Sleeper was adapted into a solo, tarot-based tabletop game</a> with Alfred Valley's help, so there's a strong precedent there.</p>
<p>The video game Martin will make next is actually the game they were pitching to their publisher Fellow Traveller before development on Citizen Sleeper 2 began. It was only the runaway success of Citizen Sleeper 1 - now at one million players and counting - that derailed those plans, turning Martin's head towards add-on content and, eventually, a sequel.</p>
<p>"I was actually already pitching my next game, which was not Citizen Sleeper 2, to my publisher," they said. "That's actually going to be the next game."</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 arrives to much anticipation on 31st January. Demos have already given us a glimpse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">a game that's quite different from Citizen Sleeper 1</a>, with a much stronger sense of tension in it and more developed, and distinct, role-playing systems. The changes work brilliantly; this could be special.</p><p>The development cycle, however, hasn't been easy. Personal challenges, as well as the pressure of living up to expectations, have made life difficult, I discovered speaking with Martin. Success, as much as we court it, can be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Look out for my full Citizen Sleeper interview soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-added-to-us-list-of-companies-allegedly-aiding-chinese-military.1076034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-us-dod-list-chinese-military<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Defense has added Chinese gaming giant to a list of companies allegedly aiding the Chinese military, a decision that Tencent itself calls a "mistake".</p>

<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Tencent was added to the DOD's list alongside battery manufacturer CATL, causing the shares of both companies to drop. Tencent's stocks fell by 7.3%, while CATL's dropped by just 2.8%.</p>

<p>The Reuters report goes on to say that Tencent responded to the DOD's decision by calling it a "mistake" and suggesting that its business would be unaffected by the move. The Chinese gaming giant also suggested it would begin legal proceedings if necessary.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=k9rKb54p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=00MChtj- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has its fingers in plenty of pies, including&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>As Reuters points out, the list, which is officially known as the Section 1260H list, doesn't prohibit Tencent from doing business in the US, so it's unlikely to have any material impact on the company's dealings in the short term.</p>

<p>However, having a presence on the list can sometimes serve as a blow to a company's reputation in the US, which could prevent other companies from wanting to do business with Tencent.</p>

<p>Given just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">how many pies</a> Tencent has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">its fingers in</a> across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">the gaming industry</a>, it's unlikely that there will be a mass exodus of studios breaking their agreements with the Chinese gaming giant, but this still likely won't come as pleasing news to the company.</p>

<p>As for what Tencent is up to outside of its addition to this list, the studio is busy working with developers both Western and non-Western on a number of different projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=RZb13lX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=6ZHFnuW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has plenty of projects on the go.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming giant is currently working with Capcom on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, and it's also behind the extremely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon</em>-coded&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which was unveiled in full back in November.</p>

<p>Tencent is also attracting talent like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">joined subsidiary LightSpeed Studios</a> recently (but not the branch that's currently working on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, another Tencent project</a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/virtuos-is-working-on-an-unannounced-remake-using-unreal-engine-5.1076022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/virtuos-unannounced-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A developer’s LinkedIn profile has revealed that Virtuos is working on an unannounced remake for current generation consoles using Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>First spotted by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the information comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksii-moskovchenko-17278017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oleksii Moskovchenko</a>‘s LinkedIn page, who is a Technical Art Director at Virtuos. His description of his current work simply reads, “unannounced UE5 PS5/XSX/PC remake.”</p>



<p>In December 2024, several rumors began to circulate that Virtuos would be developing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake on Unreal Engine 5</a>, which was further corroborated by leak Extas1s, who said that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-could-be-revealed-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game could be announced at the heavily rumored Xbox Direct</a>, which is believe to take place in January. </p>



<p>While some find it somewhat hard to believe that Virtuos could be developing a fully-fledged remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5, the proof is seemingly starting to stack up. For those out of the loop, a remake or remaster of Oblivion first popped up during the FTC investigation into Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which the game expected to release during the fiscal year of 2022 – a date that has obviously been missed.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, we shouldn’t have long to wait to know if the rumors are true if the announcement is set to come during the Xbox Direct, which WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1876466327583621306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently claimed</a> would be announced very soon. </p>



<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was first released in 2006 and has sold an estimated 9.5 million copies worldwide, according to the market research firm Electronic Entertainment Design and Research. </p>



<p>For those waiting on the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls 6, well, unfortunately, that one is still years away from release.</p>



<p>What do you think of the current rumors? Do you think Virtuos is developing The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion on Unreal Engine 5? Let us know down below, and be sure to join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

It’s only a short teaser, clocking in at just under a minute, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any shots, scenes, and characters that are worth taking a closer look at. From a grief-ridden hospital corridor to an anger-harbouring, red-drenched hospital corridor, we’ve got you covered (as well as some other non-corridor-related details).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you missed it, we already did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-two-game-references-and-new-theories-from-the-trailer">full in-depth breakdown of the first Season Two trailer</a> back in 2024, so you can read more about some of our theories about how the show might deviate from The Last of Us Part 2 game there. And we even had a go at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-predicting-season-2">predicting how this upcoming HBO season will play out</a> if you’re in the mood for pure (educated) guesswork. But stay here if you want to check out the five new details, as well as comparisons between the show and Naughty Dog’s original game that we’ve picked out from the brand-new trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Cast: Who's New and Coming Back to the HBO Show?</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Abby’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/1-1736254769934.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the teaser opens we get our first glimpse at the aftermath of The Last of Us’ most pivotal scene. An abandoned hallway, bathed by a flashing red light, is soundtracked by an alarm sound that will no doubt send shivers down the spine of anyone who has played the game. Chronologically, this takes place moments after Joel’s fateful decision to rescue Ellie from the Fireflies at the end of season one. We see a panicked Abby – portrayed here by Kaitlyn Dever – walk down the corridor leading to the operating theater of St Louis’ fictional St Mary’s Hospital. In that room, she’ll find the body of her dad, the surgeon whom Joel murdered to save Ellie. It’s the action that sets the wheel in motion for Part 2’s and (we assume) Season 2’s story of spiraling revenge and violence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Ellie’s Hospital Corridor</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/2-1736254801696.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of revenge and violence, that is exactly what is taking place in this scene just before the trailer ends, which shows Bella Ramsey’s Ellie bathed in red light in a corridor at Lakehill Seattle Hospital. This is almost certainly a replication of the moment in The Last of Us Part 2 when, having cornered one of Abby’s accomplices, Nora, Ellie proceeds to unleash what can only be described as a ferocious assault on her pleading victim. It’s a real turning point for Ellie in the game’s story as we really see for the first time how unstable she has become, and the uncomfortable lengths she’ll go in search of vengeance. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Sickle Sneak Peek</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/3-1736254830311.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us Part 2 is consistently incredibly violent, even by its predecessor’s standards, and 20 seconds into the teaser we get our first look at a bladed sickle weapon, which presumably belongs to one of the Seraphites. Also known as Scars, this cult-like faction from the game favors more workman-like weaponry such as hammers, machetes, bows, and, in this case, sickles. This may seem like a really tenuous detail, but this specific tool of destruction (or harvesting if that’s more your speed) plays a key role late in The Last of Us Part 2’s story. In a brutal showdown with a pickaxe-wielding Seraphite heavy, Abby achieves bloody victory with a Sickle, tearing apart the Seraphite’s face in a sequence that’s frequently harrowing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. A Better Look at Isaac</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/4-1736254874896.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the 21 second mark we get a lovely close-up of Jeffrey Wright, who plays Isaac Dixon, the leader of the Washington Liberation Front; a paramilitary organisation that Abby works with.  Following in the footsteps of Season 1 actor Merle Dandridge (who played Marlene), Wright actually reprises his role from the game, where he provided voice and motion-capture for Dixon in The Last of Us Part 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A complicated character consumed by conflict (as many in this story are), Dixon doesn’t get a ton of screen time in the game. Here’s hoping we get a bit more of him in the show, as well as more of that fetching beard and knitwear combo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. The Last Dance</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/07/5-1736254930006.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, at 24 seconds in, we get a look at one of the most memorable scenes from across both The Last of Us games – the Jackson dance. Dina, played in the HBO show by Alien Romulus’ Isabela Merced, can be seen embracing Ellie in a scene that will spark their romance. It’s a real warm moment of tenderness amongst the cold hopelessness that the rest of the story projects, which is likely why it endures as such a memorable moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if the chronology of events is being played around with here. In The Last of Us Part Two, the dance occurs right at the end of the story in flashback form, but we already know that Season 2 of the show is not going to reach that far into the timeline. The fact that we’re seeing it here in the trailer suggests that Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin might be tweaking the order we see these scenes, perhaps to help cement the emotional stakes of Ellie’s journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We won’t have to wait long to see what changes, if any, have been made to The Last of Us Part Two’s story, though, with Season 2 of the show only a few months away now. What are you most excited to see in the upcoming episodes? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

We see an Akira mirror match with the kind of combat usually reserved for a martial arts movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling memories of Sony’s infamous Killzone 2 reveal E3 2005 trailer, this Virtual Fighter video is a concept only, although it is “in-engine.” The animations on display are beyond what we’ve seen from fighting game gameplay in other titles, and the speed and fluidity of the movement is a step beyond normal fighting game gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega, though, made clear that what we’re seeing here should not be considered Virtua Fighter 6 gameplay, stressing: “Please note that this is a concept video created before development began. The actual gameplay and characters may differ from what is shown.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Virtua Fighter fans are excited by the return of the legendary series and the prospect that its visuals may approach the level we’re seeing in this concept video. “If they somehow manage to get the animations to look even remotely close to this in the final game, that'd be insane,” said one fan. “Regardless, I'm excited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter 6 is in development at Yakuza / Like a Dragon studio Ryo Ga Gotoku and is without a release window or target platforms. Virtua Fighter hasn’t seen a mainline release in years, leaving mini-game appearances in Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s Yakuza games and the 2021 release of Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown to tide fans over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Virtua Fighter, which includes characters such as Akira Yuki, Pai Chan, and Wolf Hawkfield, is on the hardcore end of the fighting game spectrum, with slower-paced gameplay that challenges players to master its mechanics in order to enjoy success. Virtua Fighter 5, which first released in 2006, is considered one of the greatest fighting games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>CES 2025 is officially underway, and one of the big gaming announcements so far was a partnership between Nvidia and Krafton for AI-powered teammates who can help you in battle in PUBG.</p><p>Nvidia and Krafton created what they are calling CPCs, or co-playable characters. These characters use artificial intelligence to fight alongside you. This feature is called called PUBG Ally, and the CPC is apparently smart enough to play like a human would. You can say something like, "Hey Ally, I'm looking for a level 3 vest and 5.56 ammo." The CPC will then search the map and try to find it for you. The PUBG Ally can also spot enemies and cover you, locate nearby vehicles, and speak back to you with an AI-powered voice. You can see some of the test footage in action below.</p><p>Note that what you're seeing in the video is representative of R&amp;D gameplay. The PUBG Ally feature <a href="https://x.com/PUBG/status/1876554285745606665" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hasn't actually been greenlit yet</a> and may never come to PUBG.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Transform solo gameplay into a seamless team experience with PUBG Ally. 🎮<br>KRAFTON and NVIDIA have teamed up to create the world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC), built with NVIDIA ACE.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/jAaibitkgq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jAaibitkgq</a></p>  — NVIDIAGameDev (@NVIDIAGameDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Krafton's Sims-like inZOI will also make use of this new CPC feature, though no footage or any other details were revealed as of yet.

Krafton CEO CH Kim said this new AI technology will "revolutionize the gaming industry," while Nvidia boss Keita Iida said, "AI is transforming the way games are created and played."</p><p>Plenty of people remain skeptical about how AI could actually shake up video games, in part because AI is nothing new at all in the world of gaming.

            <title><![CDATA[Manba One Gaming Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/manba-one-gaming-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manba-one-gaming-controller-review.1075989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/manba-one-gaming-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As the festive season grinds to a close, there’s still new bits of tech popping up to enhance your current gaming setup – or perhaps to help you out with whatever was sat underneath the Christmas tree. The Manba One controller instantly falls into that category, with an enhanced ‘pro’ style experience at a very reasonable price point.</p>
<p>Before you pick it up, the Manba One sets itself apart from the pack with two very key inclusions. The first are customisable RGB strips down each side of the controller, with a batch of different colour schemes and effects to choose from. The second, and perhaps more obvious feature is the screen that’s slap-bang in the middle of the controller, giving you instant access to a batch of customisation options and ways to tweak the controller’s performance. It’s a setup we’ve also seen in the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra Controller, but where that costs £180, the Manba One comes in at £75, making it much gentler on the pocket.</p>



<p>The Manba One offers both Bluetooth and wireless connections via its USB-A dongle, happily playing with PC, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android. Interestingly, those are the platforms that many of these controllers are aiming for, which makes sense when Sony and Microsoft don’t like to share their technology with others and have very specific requirements when they do.</p>
<p>The Manba One is available in black or a transparent white and silver colour scheme like our review unit. It looks and feels quite smart in the hand, and overall apes the official Xbox controller shape, with a few changes here and there. The top case is exceptionally smooth, almost to the point of being slippery, but the underside of the controller has textured plastic to ensure you don’t lose your grip. There are little windows in each handhold so you can see the rotating rumble motors inside, and alongside the screen and the RGB lighting, this is a great looking controller.</p>

<p>Included in the box is a smart charging dock, and the Manba One gives a satisfying beep when you pop it on there. Using it means it’s always ready to go and you always know where you’ve left it, and I really appreciated the experience of using the controller and dock. There is a massive downside here though, and that’s that the wireless dongle does not connect to the dock, requiring its own USB slot, meaning that if you want to use the Manba One in the most sensible way, you’re giving up two USB slots, rather than one. It makes even less sense when the dock has a little space for the dongle to go, but only for storage.</p>

<p>The main control layout is largely the same as the Xbox controller , though the first key improvement over its inspiration is the inclusion of Hall Effect sticks, whose frictionless magnetic tech should mean that they never develop stick drift, and will last a great deal longer than traditional controllers. A great first step. From there, the main face buttons are fitted with microswitches, improving response time, and providing a lovely click into the bargain. The D-pad is responsive, though it’s merely ‘alright’ in terms of feel and useability, while the shoulder buttons feel sturdy and swift.</p>
<p>The triggers is where you find another key improvement, with the inclusion of lockout switches to shorten the travel hopefully improving your response time, and bumping your Overwatch or Call of Duty kill ratio in the process. On the reverse there are also four programmable extra buttons, and they sit relatively well under your fingers. They are a tiny bit small and cramped for my hands, but I feel that’s entirely subjective.</p>
<p>The button placement that I cannot get on with though, is the row of Menu/Options/Home buttons along the front panel. Even after weeks of playing with the Manba One, I still can’t get it into my head that these sit at the bottom of the controller rather than the top, making every hop into a map or the menus an extra struggle. I understand why they’re there, I just don’t like it, reminding me of the Onlive controller from years ago.</p>
<p>The screen is really the Manba One’s party trick, and gives you immediate access to your connection settings and RGB colour schemes as well as the button configuration – including multiple button inputs – joystick curves and dead zones, trigger response points and vibration strength. It’s all very easy to get your head around too, and I really appreciated not having to dive into an app in order to make changes. This sets the Manba One apart from the rest of the pack, especially at this price point.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a great deal of time with the Manba One, mainly playing Overwatch, and things have really been going my way since shifting to it. Some of that may be that I’m getting better at the game – who knew that playing something for a long time makes you better at it? – but the Manba One definitely holds up well to competitive play, and has a batch of features that I found increasingly useful.</p>
<p>The Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra is the key competition here, and while it is undoubtedly a nicer-feeling controller, I’m not convinced that it offers twice the performance of the Manba One in line with the jump in price. Alternatively, there’s the Gamesir Tarantula Pro that’s also launched recently, which has some of its own special skills – like being able to move the buttons to a Switch layout – but misses out on the on-the-fly customisation that the screen gives you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed three major new visual media projects based on some of its most celebrated franchises, as well as a release window for the upcoming second season of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>

<p>During its CES 2025 presentation, Sony revealed that it's working on a live-action movie based on&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, with PlayStation exec Asad Qizilbash confirming that the project is in its "early stages".</p>

<p>Additionally, we're also getting a live-action movie based on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, which will, of course, be created in conjunction with Sony Pictures. Let's hope this one doesn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">require you to create a PlayStation ID</a> before you can watch it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-sony.jpg?itok=VxpFye2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-sony.jpg?itok=JNXXhjJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is getting its own movie, as is Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen what creative direction these two movies will take; they're both likely fairly early on in production, so it might be a while before we hear from them again. Will&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>be more or less subtle than its obvious inspiration&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>It's not just those two that are getting adaptations, either. Sony has also revealed that an <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2025/1/7/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-series-2027-crunchyroll" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">anime adaptation</a> of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>is in production, with a tentative release window of 2027.</p>

<p>The anime is being developed in conjunction with Sony subsidiaries Aniplex and Crunchyroll, and it'll be directed by Takanobu Mizuno, perhaps best known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Visions&nbsp;</em>short film "The Duel".</p>

<p>More specifically, the project will apparently adapt the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends&nbsp;</em>multiplayer experience. It's not entirely clear how Sony and Crunchyroll are planning to go about doing this, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-sony.jpg?itok=YupKZCG0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-sony.jpg?itok=sU1D6dFA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends&nbsp;</em>is getting its very own anime adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the second season of Sony and HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>adaptation will premiere in April, although Sony stopped short of revealing exactly what day we can expect the new season to drop.</p>

<p>Things aren't standing still in the worlds of the games these projects are based on, either. <i>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</i>developer Sucker Punch recently announced a followup <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">by the name of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>studio Naughty Dog <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">unveiled its next game</a> during last year's Game Awards, too.</p>

It’s priced at $79.99 and will be available on January 30th, with preorders starting on January 7th.</p><p>The Handheld Dock Chroma is a similar concept to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/18/23409757/valve-steam-deck-dock-docking-station-tv-gaming-nintendo-switch">official docking stations provided by Valve</a> or Nintendo, allowing users to hook handheld devices up to external displays with expanded connections to complement big-screen gaming setups. The Handheld Dock Chroma uses a USB-C cable to connect supported devices, including Android phones and tablets, iPads and iPhones with USB-C ports, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Nintendo Switch</a>, and Razer’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/15/23392481/razer-edge-android-cloud-gaming-tablet-qualcomm-price-release-date-specs">Edge Android gaming handheld</a>. </p><div><div><figcaption><em>Here are the port options in the rear, plus the USB-C cable to connect to your device.

The feature also makes use of the Kishi Ultra’s Sensa HD support, which converts audio output into haptic feedback on supported Android devices (but sadly isn’t available for iOS). PC Remote Play allows games to be streamed at full resolution without compromising “visual quality or game speed,” according to Razer, and can be accessed via the Razer Nexus app on iOS or Android.</p><div><figcaption><em>Razer’s new PC Remote Play feature provides PC-to-Phone streaming capabilities similar to the Steam Link mobile app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.

Project Arielle is a mesh gaming chair that features a bladeless fan system that’s designed to keep you at a comfortable temperature regardless of what environment you’re in. </p><p>We briefly tried it here at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24307731/ces-2025-tvs-gaming-smart-home-wearables-news/archives/2">CES 2025</a> and it’s cool! Or warm, depending on the mode you set it to. When my colleague Sean Hollister tried it, he found it didn’t just warm or cool his butt, but gently and quietly blew a substantial amount of climate-controlled air onto his upper back from small holes along the chair’s top edge.</p><div><figcaption><em>A more comfortable way to freeze your butt off.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Building on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23883174/razer-fujin-pro-gaming-chair-herman-miller-aeron">$1,049 Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair</a> that you <em>can</em> currently buy, Project Arielle has three adjustable fan speeds that can reduce the perceived temperature by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius (around 3.6 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) in “dry environments,” according to Razer. That sounds pretty useful if you live in a hot climate or if your gaming PC kicks out enough heat to turn your room into a sweatbox. </p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a rendering that shows how the hot or cool air is dispersed from the chair.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div><p>For chillier environments, the chair has a built-in PTC heating system (the same kind found in most vehicles and heated car seats) that can spit out warm air at 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The fans and that temperatures are adjusted using touch panel controls located next to the seat pad. And given this is a Razer product, there’s obviously RGB lighting throughout the chair. By default, it’s set to Razer’s trademark green when it’s off, and we saw the edge glow red when warm, blue when cool, and purple or orange when cooling or warming. </p><div><figcaption><em>Icons on the touch-controlled panel and the built-in RGB lighting indicate whether the chair is set to blast warm or cold air.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>One downside: you can’t spin 360 degrees in this chair without wrapping a cord around yourself, as it does need to be plugged in. But even the prototype already has a cable that’ll safely disconnect if you accidentally give it a yank.</p><div><figcaption><em>The breakaway cable will disconnect if it’s pulled, kinda like the early Xbox controllers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Given Project Arielle is only a concept chair, this unfortunately isn’t something you can actually buy just yet. Razer has showcased a lot of quirky gaming gadget concepts at CES over the years, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">chair cushions that shake your ass</a> with haptic feedback. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/ces-2025">CES 2025</a>, Nvidia finally announced their RTX 50 series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a>, and can I just say that I am wise to the RTX 5090’s tricks. A GPU that eats up to 575W and costs £1939 / $1999? Yeah, nice try, Geoffrey N. Vidia, but such a mad card couldn’t possibly exist in reality. It’s clearly only here to make the other ones, the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070, look like better deals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delivered by snakeskin-jacketed CEO Jensen Huang – interesting optics there – the CES keynote also detailed DLSS 4, an upgraded version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a> and its anti-aliasing/frame generation combo, as well as the input lag-quelling Nvidia Reflex 2. Let’s stick with the new GPUs for a moment, though, not least because I worry that I actually quite fancy the sound of the RTX 5070 and am convinced I’m being mindgamed into it.</p>

<p>Here’s the key specs and the pricing, which with the exception of the RTX 5090, actually stoops lower than each model’s RTX 40 series equivalent. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review">RTX 4080</a>, for instance, launched at £1269 / $1199, while the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-review">RTX 4070</a> started from £589 / $599. Only the RTX 5090 and RTX 5070 Ti get VRAM capacity upgrades, though all four are switching to the newer, faster GDDR7.</p>

<p>Given that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review">RTX 4090</a> currently struggles with precisely nothing, even the enforced ray tracing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> at 4K, it’s hard to see the RTX 5090 as anything other than a two-grand solution to a problem that never existed. The rest, though? Could be worse, could be worse. It took the RTX 40 series half a generation to fix its affordability mistakes with a new batch of RTX Supers, and these new GPUs are either cheaper or no more expensive. They're all a damn sight less than the RTX 5090, at any rate. Ah, there, see, they did it again.</p><p>Much like how the RTX 40 series got you exclusive usage of DLSS 3, the RTX 50 series also enables DLSS 4, which adds a 'Multi-Frame Generation' feature that can essentially create up to three AI frames for every rendered one. As opposed to DLSS 3, which can just generate up to one extra frame per regular frame. It’s already set for support in 75 games, a decent majority of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">those that currently work with DLSS 3</a>, and its proposed benefits come down to simple maths: more generated frames equals higher framerates, and in turn, better visual smoothness.</p>

<p>This could be a nice touch, though DLSS 4 comes with its own causes for concern. For one, it kind of throws most of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/50-series/rtx-5070-family/">Nvidia’s own benchmark results</a> out of whack, with most graphs putting a thumb on the scales by comparing the fully revved-up, DLSS 4 versions of games against older DLSS versions. For what it’s worth, they do include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a> results that don’t use any upscaling at all, and the RTX 50 GPUs look to average about 20-25% than their predecessors there. With DLSS 4 and Multi-Frame Generation, it’s more like 100%, including in the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/behold-the-cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-mode-your-gpu-probably-cant-run">path tracing</a>.</p>
<p>Input lag is another worry, as while DLSS 4 does pour more frames down your eyes, it’ll also mean waiting for those additional AI-generated frames to get out the way before you’ll see another, rendered frame that actually reflects your inputs. Nvidia say this will be addressed, however, by Reflex 2. On top of using the same latency reduction techniques as previous Reflex versions (mainly by having your CPU and GPU work in closer synchronisation), Reflex 2 adds a tool called Frame Warp.</p><p>It works like this: while your graphics card is rendering a frame, the CPU analyses your mouse input to work out where the camera position is going to move to. Reflex 2 then takes the data from the rendered frame and 'warps' the image to use this new, more rapidly calculated camera position, using predictive rendering the fill up any gaps that the additional movement might create. The result should be that what you see on your monitor will better reflect your most recent inputs, potentially cutting input lag by another 50% over standard Reflex.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/reflex-2.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Reflex 2 will launch alongside the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 when they release on January 30th, though future updates will add support for older RTX graphics cards. Hopefully more games as well, as only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> and Valorant currently have Reflex 2 'coming soon.'.</p>
<p>I might be the victim of some big dual-fanned psyop, vis a vis the new GPUs, but on balance Reflex 2 is probably my favourite thing to come out of Nvidia’s reveal-athon. It just seems like a good example of using creative rendering techniques and predictive tech to make games feel and function better; I quite like frame generation as a concept and DLSS 4 probably be good for making numbers go up, but a game will still feel like wading through warm tar if only 20 of those hundred-odd frames per second are really being rendered by your PC.</p>
<p>Still, there are worse things to do with generative AI. Like, uh, PUBG Ally, the creepily subservient "Co-Playable Character" built with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-spoke-to-an-nvidia-ai-npc-and-he-mainly-wanted-to-get-me-bladdered">Nvidia ACE</a> NPC toolkit that lets you bring the Dead Internet theory directly into your battle royales.</p>

            <p>
Sony has unveiled its latest accessories to get the Midnight Black treatment: the DualSense Edge wireless controller, Pulse Elite wireless headset and the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, as well as the PlayStation Portal.
</p>
<p>
The new range joins the existing Midnight Black colour options for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-gets-black-and-red-versions">regular DualSense</a> (released back in May 2021) and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-unveils-new-midnight-black-colour-option-for-its-pulse-3d-wireless-headset">Pulse 3D wireless headset</a> (released in September 2021), as well as the PS5's black console covers.
</p>
<p>Today's announcement also comes alongside a slight reduction in price for the DualSense Edge controller in the UK and mainland Europe, with the model now officially £10/€20 cheaper, at £200/€220 instead of £210/€240.</p>
<p>
Sony adding more to its Midnight Black collection had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-dualsense-edge-and-pulse-headphones-reportedly-getting-black-colour-version">previously</a> been reported. As you'd expect, the range is coloured, well, black. Here's a video showing how it all looks:

<p>
"Each Midnight Black accessory features a unique, rich shade of black, with sleek detailing on various buttons and accents such as the PlayStation logo," Sony says, attempting to spin the fact these are coloured black into a full paragraph, which I myself am also now guilty of.
</p><p>
The charging case for the Pulse Explore earbuds is black, the charging hanger for the Pulse Elite headset is black, and the carrying case for the DualSense Edge controller is also black. However, the carrying case for the Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds will be... felt grey.
</p>
<p>The range will go on sale via direct.playstation.com and participating from 20th February, with pre-orders open on 16th January if you're feeling super keen. Pricing is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation Portal remote player – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99 </li>
<li>Pulse Explore wireless earbuds – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>
<li>Pulse Elite wireless headset – Midnight Black: $149.99 | €149.99 | £129.99 GBP</li>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Fancy one?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets-revealed-black-ops-cold-war-cost-700m.1075950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A court document filed by&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>publisher Activision has revealed just how astronomically huge the budgets for the first-person shooter franchise can get, with even games from a few years ago reaching hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Game File, Stephen Totilo points to a court filing in which Activision's Patrick Kelly outlines budget figures for three&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games, namely&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3</em>, 2019's&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>reboot, and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War</em>.</p>

<p>According to those numbers,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3&nbsp;</em>cost Activision more than $450 million to make across its lifespan, while&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>cost $640 million and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>set the company back a staggering $700 million.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-modern-warfare.jpg?itok=PtzHJ9fM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-modern-warfare.jpg?itok=g-yjSCa- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>'s budget broke the $600 million mark, and it's not even Activision's most expensive&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth bearing in mind that Kelly's figures refer to the development costs for these games' entire life cycles, not just the initial cost to make them.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>is, after all, a live-service franchise, and money must be spent to create content after the games are initially released.</p>

<p>Every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game also sells tens of millions of copies, so it's very likely Activision is recouping its development budget and then some for each game.</p>

<p>In fact, Kelly points to sales figures for each of the games listed;&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 3&nbsp;</em>sold 43 million copies,&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>shifted 41 million, and&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>managed to sell 30 million units over its lifetime.</p>

<p>Obviously, Kelly's numbers don't include the most recent&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, but we do know that it apparently&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch yet</a>, so let's just say it's unlikely the budget is lower than&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War</em>'s was.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-black-ops-6.jpg?itok=ckIxWp3u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-budgets-black-ops-6.jpg?itok=YJzdA8-8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s budget is likely to be even higher than its predecessors'.</figcaption></figure><p>Most major publishers and developers don't publicly reveal their budgets to this degree, so we don't have a lot of points of comparison. However, Totilo points to what he calls a "poorly redacted court filing" from 2023, which puts&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>'s development cost at about $220 million.</p>

<p>Now, obviously,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2&nbsp;</em>isn't a live-service game, so its budget will naturally be smaller. Still, this just goes to show the insane amounts of money&nbsp;Activision is spending on each&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game, especially compared to other industry tentpole releases.</p>
