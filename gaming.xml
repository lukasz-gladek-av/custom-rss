<figure><a title="Gulikit - TT PRO and MAX" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17baa59efc7bb/gulikit-tt-pro-and-max.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gulikit has unveiled two new premium controllers at its booth in Gamescom, both of which will be fully compatible with the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Dubbed the <strong>TT PRO</strong> and <strong>TT MAX</strong>, the design is kind of a cross between the Xbox and PlayStation, utilising the former's overall shape, yet shifting the left analogue stick to the bottom for a more symmetrical design. The controller was originally showcased last year as the 'Libra MAX', but Gulikit has since been hard at work finalising the design and specs.</p>
<p>Both models utilise Gulikit's brand new 720° tension-adjustable TMR analogue sticks with adjustable star-ring RGB lighting, rumble motors with a total of nine adjustable levels of vibration, 'Smart Trigger' technology to let players toggle between mouse-like micro-switch triggers and pressure sensitive analogue Hall Effect triggers, and of course, gyro aiming.</p>
<p>You've also got two different types of 'floating' d-pad designs (though we're not <em>completely</em> sold on the satellite dish-inspired design), four swappable rear paddles, and an extra ABXY key-cap kit in case you want to swap between Switch and PC layouts.</p>
<p>As for the differences between the two models, the TT MAX offers up an extra stick cap kit to customise your analogue sticks between three different height options, the ability to toggle between 8-directional and 4-direction d-pad functionalities, and motion-sense technology for PC gaming.</p>
<p>Gulikit is aiming to release both controllers in <strong>October 2025</strong>, though pricing has yet to be confirmed. As with the company's recent releases, however, both models will be able to wake the Switch 2 from Sleep Mode - bosh.</p>

            <p>
You really have to hand it to the publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>. They are the absolute masters of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the doyens of stepping on rakes, even as they near the checkered flag. The long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> got a new trailer and what may actually prove to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">the final release date</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live this week. The trailer was a feisty show of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>-esque mayhem, and the hands-on verdicts I've read (save for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">stinky uncle Eurogamer</a>) have been positive. Ours is forthcoming.
</p>
<p>
But then came the revelation that this much-delayed sequel to a quintessentially faction-led RPG from a company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">famous for downloadable add-ons</a> would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">sell two of its vampire clans as day-one DLC</a>. How we laughed! How we clutched our faces and chittered like gerbils! How we ran outside, begging for the moon to fall on our heads! Despair springs anew.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Our reporter on the ground at Gamescom is hardware editor James 'Hardwearing' Archer. He caught up with current and hopefully, final Bloodlines 2 developers The Chinese Room in person yesterday and, much like a parent coaxing a child away from a poisonous snake, casually asked them 'What's the thinking behind splitting off two of the clans as DLC?' 
</p>
<p>
The answer, broadly, is that the new clans represent additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game - sometimes at Paradox's request - so it's fair to flog those bits separately. As for releasing the DLC alongside the main game, which naturally suggests that it could be sold as part of the main game, a PR told James, not in so many words, that they don't want players to have to wait.
</p><p>
Narrative director Ian Thomas attempted to spell it all out. "It's worthwhile saying that the game - well, I've only been on the game, I think, for two and a half years - but during that period, we've had huge cycles of 'What are the player base thinking? What are they asking for? How does that fit in? What does the early alpha testing say, and what are they actually asking for?'" he said. (Side note to any more prosperous game developers reading: I feel like you are all taught by media training people to stall for time with rhetorical questions. Please stop doing this, it's very exasperating and only makes me suspicious.)
</p>
<p>
"So we've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like," Thomas continued. "Including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it."
</p>
<p>
According to Thomas, The Chinese Room are still "adding additional content even over the last few weeks". The extra clan material and associated story bits fall into this rubric of post-concept 'fattening'. So do certain character customisation features like hairstyles, piercings and tattoos, according to project design director Jey Hicks. "It's not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in," he said. "It's all got that same quality there." 
</p>
<p>
The original Bloodlines shipped with seven vampire clans, including one of the clans Bloodlines 2 wants to paywall. They appear to be very different games, however - Paradox have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">describing the sequel as a "spiritual successor"</a> - as one might expect from the fact that The Chinese Room have sod-all experience making CRPGs. I think it would be fair to argue that Bloodlines 2 only having four clans by default simply reflects a necessary change of direction, however much fans of the original might dislike that change of direction. It's also worth noting that the conditions of game development have changed enormously since 2004, and that given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">the turmoil of Bloodlines 2's overall development under Paradox</a>, it's miraculous they have anything to show at all.</p><p>But that's not the case the developers made to us at Gamescom. And in particular, none of the above really explains the decision to ship features returning players would reasonably expect to form part of the base package as day-one 'extras'. The "additional work" argument would ring truer if the DLC clans landed after release; as it is, the designation as to what constitutes the original concept and what constitutes an 'extra' seems totally arbitrary. The language about not wanting fans to wait just feels like predictable camouflage for the boring truth that they'd like to make more money.

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to grow bigger and better, and Season 4 is now rapidly approaching. We’ve got all the details on when it’s expected to drop and what could feature.</p>



<p>Following the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3.5</a>, which introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-blade-guide-release-date-stats-abilities-team-up-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blade as a playable character</a>, the game has been transitioning toward Season 4, which takes place after the defeat of Knull and Hela, who became the Queen in Black.</p>



<p>If you’re anxiously awaiting the drop of the new season, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-date-amp-time">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New battles. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although yet to be officially confirmed, Season 4 in Marvel Rivals is expected to begin on September 12, with several hints suggesting this is the case.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, that would mark the four-week point since the start of Season 3.5, which is the Marvel Rivals schedule for new season drops, and the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250819/41548_1254783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ancient Powers Awaken event</a> is due to end on September 12.</p>



<p>The end date for the event should line up perfectly with the start of the new season, though the rewards will be available to earn permanently if you purchase the Premium Pass. The end time has been confirmed to be <strong>September 12th at 2am PT.</strong></p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve detailed what time the release will be in your timezone. However, remember that end of season patches come alongside downtime, so you’ll need to wait a little while longer for servers to open.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">02:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">04:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">05:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">09:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00, September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-4">What’s Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4?</h2>



<p><strong>Full details of exactly what is coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4 are yet to be shared, but we know it will feature a new character, new maps, and a new Season Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Following several leaks at launch, we know a long list of characters that have been found in datamines, but developers are keeping their cards close to their chests. However, there have been some teases during Season 3.5 on what may be coming.</p>



<p>In the game’s lore, Hela was defeated by Blade with Dracula’s sword and escaped to a mysterious Eighth City, expected to be the ancient city of K’un-Lun, and met a shadowy figure by the name of Dizang. Artwork for the character, who has glowing eyes and horns, has led many to speculate that one of the new heroes will be Daredevil.</p>



<p>The lore text also mentions that Hela is likely to be pursued by “one of her kin” for her actions and, with Loki and Thor already in the game, that could open the door to Angela.</p>



<p>If the pair are to feature, it could be Angela that appears first, as Dizang has previously been a possessed version of Daredevil who leads The Hand, and he could therefore take the role as Season 4’s main antagonist, before being rescued and restored to a normal state for the second half of the season.</p>



<p>This is all merely speculation at this stage, however, but it won’t be too much longer until we have an official reveal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a new DLC update as well as its next story chapter on the 10th September.</p>
<p>The story update, which will be free, has you investigate a series of murders. It follows on directly from the main story of the base game, and will take you beneath Arrakeen where all manner of secrets await you.</p>
<p>As for the DLC, it'll cost $12.99 and is dubbed the "Lost Harvest" DLC. In it, you'll be called to a mysterious crashed ship out in the desert, and be able to build a new ground vehicle: The Treadwheel. This offers "no material benefit" over base vehicles in the game according to the Dune: Awakening DLC blog post, and can be traded with other players without the DLC.</p>

            <p>JRPG Lost Hellden has received a fresh gameplay trailer to show off its "Deep 2D" painted art style and action battle system.</p>
<p>The game, from Artisan Studios, was previously revealed as a 2025 Switch game, but has now been pushed back to 2026 and is set for release across Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic GoG).</p>
<p>Lost Hellden is a JRPG in a classic style, which is testament to its veteran developers. Hitoshi Sakimoto (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a>, Tactics Ogre, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>) is behind the music and audio, while its illustrations are from Takeshi Oga (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gravity-rush">Gravity Rush</a>, Siren).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Outside of video games, books are one of my biggest passions. I have been an avid reader for as long as I can remember, have had a library membership near enough my entire life, studied literature at university, and I have an ever growing collection of books at home. Ideally, I would like to have my own small bookstore but alas, some things are out of reach. Tiny Bookshop is a cosy book selling game that lets me live my dream, and it could be one of the best games to relax with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tiny Bookshop Launch Trailer | Wholesome Games Celebration" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFjy4EK7B_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tiny Bookshop you have moved to the small town of Bookstonbury with all your belongings in you car, and a shed hitched to the back of it. This is not any old shed, but the base of your travelling book selling business, where all sorts of people will come to get some page turners. The game starts small with your constrained collection of books, one shelving unit, and one location in which to sell, and you grow from there.</p>


<p>You have different genres including crime, drama, classics, fact, fantasy, travel, and kids books which means there’s a wide variety for customers to choose from, but it is not as simple as putting every genre out on display. As you come to know the people and the town, you will come to realise that each place has its own type of clientele that like certain genres. At the Waterfront, the sailors primarily like the travel books and fact books, while kids books are unlikely to sell so there is little point having them on display.</p>
<p>You have a limited stock of books that depletes each day as you sell them, so you need to spend money on acquiring more stock to sell. That is not the only thing you can spend your hard-earned money on though. Various characters have their own stores you can buy goods from, as does the local newspaper, and these items can provide bonuses. Certain objects will boost the sale chance of specific genres, while others may bring you in more money. However, it is not as simple as picking the items and activating them. You have to have the space in and around your little bookstore and also be aware of the negative traits some items have. For example, some scarier items will lower the chances of selling kids books as fewer kids may visit the shop. Once you open up the shop for the day, you cannot just sit back and let the customers peruse the shelves.</p>


<p>Occasionally, customers will ask you for a recommendation, giving you specific criteria. This is perhaps the most challenging part of the game, because when you stock your shelves before opening you have no idea what titles are going to be there. Each recommendation challenge has its own difficulty rating, with this affected by the types of books you have on your shelf and the number of books left in stock. Someone coming in early when the shelves are full are more likely to get what they are looking for, compared to someone coming in near closing time with shelves almost bare. The majority of the books are real books, so if you have some literary knowledge that can make it easier to recommend a title, and it feels good to get a match, but when you get it wrong it does feel annoying. Most of the time it will be down to you just getting it wrong, but there were a few instances where a books description and what someone was looking for seemed to match up, but the game did not like it so it was a failed recommendation.</p>
<p>In your life as a bookseller, you will get encouragement and tips from those that have made Bookstonbury their home. There are some regulars that come to visit who will have their specific tastes, like Tilde and her crime books, and as time passes you will learn more about each of these characters. As you get to know them, the different characters will make requests to help them, such as helping to put on a play, or set you a challenge like selling out all of your books in a specific location. There is no time limit or fail state with these requests or challenges so you can relax and get to them when you are ready to do them.</p>

<p>Tiny Bookshop has a calendar of events to look to as well, allowing you to maximise your book selling as you set up at these locations with higher footfall. The game also goes through the different seasons, and in each season some locations may be off limits or have minimal footfall so it is not worth the cost of setting up in those places. The artstyle throughout the game is easy on the eye, colourful, and adds to the chilled vibe of Tiny Bookshop. The music is also very good at setting the cosy atmosphere in a very lo-fi style. The characters are all decently written, but as time goes on you do start seeing repeated lines by each one. They also do not keep track of what they buy so sometimes you can just recommend them the same book they bought before.</p>

<p>"It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nightdive Studios' CEO Stephen Kick has once again reiterated his desire to remaster <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a> (or at the very least see <em>some</em> sort of rerelease), originally released on the GameCube in 2002.</p>
<p>If you remember back in 2022, Kick posted on social media to state that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/nightdive-studios-wants-to-remaster-titles-like-eternal-darkness-but-hasnt-had-any-luck-with-nintendo">Nightdive had been involved in discussions with Nintendo</a> about remastered some of its games, but noted that the company was "gun shy" about working with third-party developers. He followed up by saying that "Eternal Darkness is #1 on my list".</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview with Shacknews, Kick once again mentioned Eternal Darkness as one of the games high up on his so-called 'bucket list' of titles to remaster. At the very top is the 2000 FPS title <strong>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</strong> from Monolith Productions; a game that may well prove difficult to revisit thanks to complications around the IP rights.</p>
<p>Here's what Kick said about Eternal Darkness:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I will say that there's another game really high on that list, and that would have to be Eternal Darkness. It's been kinda locked behind the GameCube/Nintendo wall all this time, and it's something that I would personally love to see get rereleased."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nightdive's next release for the Switch is a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a>, originally released in 1997 and built on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_dark_forces_remaster">Star Wars: Dark Forces</a>' Jedi engine. It's currently scheduled to launch on. <strong>20th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 will be released day one in the Xbox Game Pass catalog to subcribers of the service, it has been revealed.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-revealed-with-new-announcement-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal earlier this year</a> confirmed a release before the end of 2025, which has since been narrowed down to Fall 2025. While there’s not an exact date, there is one huge bit of news.</p>



<p>Confirmed during Gamescom, where PowerWash Simulator 2 has a playable demo, the title will land on the Xbox Game Pass catalog as a day-one release.</p>



<h2 id="h-powerwash-simulator-2-releasing-on-game-pass">PowerWash Simulator 2 Releasing on Game Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1958197918210433486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), which came with fresh gameplay footage, it was announced that the title is coming to Xbox Game Pass day one and will make “Xbox feel a bit more gnomely this Fall.”</p>



<p>The confirmation isn’t super surprising, considering the initial game, which released on consoles in July 2022 after an early access period on Steam, also launched day one with the Game Pass service, where it has remained ever since.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, expansion packs for the first game are not included with a Game Pass subscription, and it remains to be seen whether the same approach is taken with the sequel.</p>



<p>PowerWash Simulator 2 features a fresh campaign to wash through, with new locations, new multi-stage jobs, new tools, and a home base that you can decorate with things you have collected on your journey.</p>



<p>New tools include an abseiling rig and a cherry picker, helping you get to those hard-to-reach spots that always seem to be just out of reach. For those playing online co-op, progression is shared, while couch co-op is also supported.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forza Horizon 6 could be set in Japan, following a fresh leak that seemingly confirms the location for the title, which has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<p>With Forza Horizon 5 now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on PlayStation 5</a>, and Forza Motorsport studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10 suffering huge layoffs</a>, all eyes are cast towards Horizon 6 as the next entry in the beloved franchise, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-forza-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer confirmed would release in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Since first releasing in 2012, Playground Games has brought the Horizon Festival to Colorado, Southern France, Northern Italy, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. Now, it appears the franchise is heading to Japan.</p>



<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-leak-hints-at-japan">Forza Horizon 6 Leak Hints at Japan</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tokyo Drift. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a now-deleted post, which was shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Australian car import company Cult &amp; Classic posted an image of someone, said to be from the Forza Horizon team, down under, scanning Kei cars to feature in the series.</p>



<p>Kei cars are the smallest approved in Japan to drive on expressways and are rarely seen outside of the Far East, hence why someone from the Horizon development team would need to fly out to scan them.</p>



<p>If the setting is indeed in Japan, having an accurate representation of Kei cars would be needed for accuracy, as it would be weird to drive on the roads without seeing them, and it could tease that they will be purchasable in the game.</p>



<p>Of course, take this all with a significant pinch of salt as it is far from an official confirmation, but Japan has long been requested by the Horizon community, so it would be a perfect choice for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>Japan is iconic in the street-racing scene, having been the location for The Fast &amp; Furious: Tokyo Drift movie.</p>



<p>Is Japan top of your wishlist as a location to play host to the Forza Horizon series? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

handheld mode on Switch 2 and came away very disappointed with the game's performance, especially when in the open areas like Limgrave. Frame rate drops were significant when turning the camera whilst exploring outside of the tutorial area, and this, combined with a confusing button layout on Switch 2, made combat confusing and exploration fairly dispiriting. We weren't allowed to record gameplay at the booth, probably due to this fact, but you can hear our thoughts on Elden Ring Switch 2 handheld gameplay in this video.

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is edging ever closer to release, and now the game has received an ESRB rating ahead of launch.</p>



<p>The ESRB rating follows on from receiving a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-for-switch-2-by-south-korea-classification-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rating from the South Korean Rating Board</a> last month, with the game ticking yet another box ahead of a 2025 release window, which has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reconfirms-2025-release-window-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconfirmed by Nintendo</a>.</p>



<p>While a precise release window has not been shared, the news must surely be on the horizon, given that ratings from two separate regions have now been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-rated-t-by-esrb">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Rated T by ESRB</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s coming. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo store</a> has revealed the rating for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond issued by the ESRB is T for Teen, with the game featuring animated blood, violence, and in-game purchases.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently playable at Gamescom with a demo, further indication that a release is edging closer, and Nintendo could now be diverting attention toward the release following the recent Nintendo Direct focused on Kirby Air Riders.</p>



<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo has adopted an approach of handing big releases their own Direct show, having done so for Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Kirby Air Riders—the latter of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releases November 20</a>.</p>



<p>While Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, unlike the other three titles, is not a Switch 2 exclusive, it is still one of the biggest Nintendo releases set for this year, alongside the likes of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing October 16</a>.</p>



<p>Release date details for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond should now be on the horizon, given the ESRB rating, with only a few more boxes left to be ticked.</p>

<p>Prologue demo also announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Falcom and GungHo have today confirmed the upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> will be getting a Switch 2 Edition.</p>
<p>This particular version will be a digital release and includes higher resolution and frame rate "for sharper" and "smoother graphics", along with reduced load times. This is part of a paid upgrade path for existing Switch owners and is priced at <strong>$1.00 USD</strong> (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<figure><a title="Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2dcd98f04fd51/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>As you can see in the fine print above, to "play Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you must purchase the paid Upgrade Pack" and this "Upgrade Pack alone" does not give you access to the full game. A standard physical release will be available for the Switch as well as a 'SteelBook' and 'Bracer Edition'.</p>
<p>Along with this news, a <a href="https://trailsfirstchapter.com/trial/">prologue demo has also been revealed for Switch</a> and other platforms. Players will be able to carry over their save data to the full version, when it arrives next month on <strong>19th September 2025</strong>. The demo is now live in Japan.</p>

<p>After a restart, delays and an incredibly long wait, it appears Retro Studios' anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> may have <em>finally</em> been rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board.</p>
<p>A rating has recently been spotted on Nintendo's website in the US, taking it from "Rating Pending" to a 'T' for "Teen" classification.</p>
<p>The currently attached description on the same page references animated blood and violence. As noted by <a href="https://shinesparkers.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-has-been-rated-by-the-esrb-what-it-means/">Metroid fan site Shinesparkers</a>, this age rating would be consistent with the main <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> games <em>before</em> the fourth entry.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here is ESRB's basic summary of this age rating, describing what a game under this classification may contain. The guide on its <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/">website also goes into detail</a> about "interactive elements" referenced by the rating above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Teen - content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ratings for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, 2 and 3 in this same region contained "animated blood" and "violence". The classification and "rating summary" for Beyond has not gone live on ESRB's official website yet, so if there are any changes or updates, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>This discovery follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/metroid-prime-4-beyond-rating-spotted-fuelling-nintendo-direct-hopes-again">game being rated in South Korea</a> by the Game Rating and Administration Committee in July, so hopefully, all this recent activity means an official release date isn't too far away. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently targeting a <strong>2025</strong> launch and the Switch 2 version will include enhanced resolution and frame rate as well as Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lineup of games for the remainder of this year is already looking quite busy, with the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> game scheduled for October and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> now locked in for November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's not often I'm thrown when previewing a video game. But thrown is exactly what I was when I stepped into the unassuming Xbox Room #10 in Xbox's business hall booth during Day 1 of Gamescom 2025. There were six seats, a small table, and a television showcasing Keeper, the upcoming adventure game from Psychonauts developer Double Fine Productions centered around a walking lighthouse and a bird. Oh, and the studio's CEO and games industry legend, Tim Schafer.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody told me the person showcasing Keeper would be Schafer, and it's kinda wild to walk into a room and be surprise-greeted by a developer you massively respect. Of course, Schafer is a true gentleman, kind, and genuinely hilarious, so the nerves quickly disappear as he walks me through three previously recorded gameplay segments of Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTjCk55-Dg4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cTjCk55-Dg4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>I promise I'll talk about those segments, but everything Schafer told me beforehand was just as interesting (possibly more). First off, it's his first time doing press since 2021 with Psychonauts 2, so Schafer explains that <em>he's</em> nervous – ahhh, even ground – and his first time at Gamescom in 16 years! Though he was here in person to talk about Keeper, he mostly speaks about Lee Petty, the game's director (and Brutal Legend and Broken Age art director) and the person behind the wild idea that is Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>Schafer says Keeper wouldn't exist without Double Fine becoming an Xbox studio. "Around the time we had just joined the Xbox family, we were wondering what we should make next," Schafer says. "We have support; we have money; and we don't have to worry about going out of business every day, and we don't have to pitch to publishers, 'Please make our game, it's very commercial.'"&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Petty was busy thinking about his time during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was locked in his home like the rest of us, but he found solace in nature hikes amongst the hills around San Francisco. He couldn't get an idea out of his head: what if humanity didn't survive this, but nature did and took over in our place? It's here that Schafer explains Petty is a "weird dude who loves strange images, and grew up loving <em>Dark Crystal </em>and Salvador Dali."&nbsp;</p>










<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ff61d485-7cfe-4924-9218-ae8ed2e1203e" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

<p>The result of all that pondering is Keeper – weird and chill, like Petty and his interests, Schafer says. He then describes the game as an adventure game with puzzles – light puzzles, though, because Keeper is about the "atmosphere and vibes and companionship between these two." The two he's talking about are Twig, a sea bird, and an unnamed lighthouse. After a violent sea storm isolates Twig from her flock, she perches on a lighthouse. For some reason, this awakens the lighthouse, it tips over, and in the resulting crash, it grows legs. Typical lighthouse behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Awakened and the new owner of legs, this lighthouse feels immediately called to a giant mountain peak atop the island it's on. So, it begins heading that way, with Twig in tow. Controlling the lighthouse consists of moving through surrealist and fantastical landscapes and shining your beam on things. You can shine your beam on plants and sometimes they'll grow; you can shine your beam on gears and sometimes Twig will fly to them and rotate them to unlock gates; you can shine your beam on strange pot creatures that crash to the floor beneath them, sometimes revealing objects for Twig to interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your primary method of interacting with this world is your beam, and second to that is Twig. This might just be a me thing as someone who lives a couple hours away from Disney World and has a fondness for the technology of animatronics, but Keeper most reminds me of a Disney dark ride. If you're unfamiliar with that term, dark rides include Pirates of the Caribbean and The Haunted Mansion. It's less about thrills and more about experiencing the things around you, watching animatronics move to tell a story, and soaking in the vibes. That's Keeper.&nbsp;</p><p>I love that shining your light on objects causes them to emote or come to life with animation. It might not affect your journey forward or be part of a puzzle every time, but that's okay – it's about the vibes! It's about watching the animatronics of this world, as it were, do things that make the surrounding area feel real, like it has its own story to tell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The puzzles I see seem simple and quick, but I can't help keeping an eye on the things outside the primary focus of these gameplay videos. I see sunflowers dance as light grazes over them, carrots come to life and dive bomb into the soil below, and more. It really feels like a Double Fine dark ride in the most complimentary way.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, I see some other things that catch my eye. At one point, Twig becomes a giant egg atop the lighthouse for some reason. I see a village of tiny lil guys that are rusty watches. I see the lighthouse prance through pink pollen that gives it a light, low-gravity effect when it jumps. Everything I see looks vastly different from what I witness moments before, but it's all oozing with Double Fine and surrealist Salvador Dali-inspired charm.&nbsp;</p><p>Some areas are more linear, designed around puzzles, Schafer says. Other areas are more open, prime for exploration. Regardless of where you are in the lighthouse's journey to the mountain peak, Schafer says Keeper is ultimately about change; how nature changes, how Twig changes, how the lighthouse changes. Every character, including Twig and the Lighthouse, has a story arc, he adds.&nbsp;</p><p>When I ask Schafer why Petty decided to have players control a lighthouse, Schafer laughs – he doesn't actually know. He says the lighthouse was one of the game's side characters, but when he saw it walking with legs, he told Petty that needs to be the game. "It was compelling," Schafer says. "It really looked like something from a surrealist painting."&nbsp;</p>

</article>
<p>Schafer ends my presentation further explaining Double Fine's love of nonsense and the bizarre, the type of work directors David Lynch and David Cronenberg are interested in making, he says. I see the vision.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeper is a weird game, but it has that undeniable Double Fine charm. I can't wait to actually play it when it launches on October 17 on Xbox Series X/S and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/keeper-is-a-salvador-dali-inspired-surrealist-adventure-with-no-dialogue]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Unreal Engine 5-powered horror game based on 1978’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/retrorealms-halloween-ash-evil-dead-horror-16-bit-retro-1851620847"><em>Halloween</em></a> from director John Carpenter is in the works and will launch next year. It’s titled <em>Halloween: The Game,</em> and will feature iconic slasher Michael Myers killing people on the night he returns home.</p> <p>Announced on August 20, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219630/Halloween/">Halloween: The Game</a>,</em> which isn’t the most creative name, will be heavily inspired by the original movie and will feature a “one-versus-many stealth horror experience.” The game will let players put on Michael’s mask and stab their friends online in multiplayer or run away from the killer as a civilian of Haddonefield. IllFonic, the team developing <em>Halloween: The Game, </em>is a studio that has become well-known for its focus on asymmetrical online games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a> and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/rest-in-pieces-friday-the-13th-the-game-1827582283">now-defunct<em> Friday the 13th</em> game.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Here’s the official trailer for <em>Halloween: The Game:</em></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFfhM1Jxqds?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>In a press release for the newly announced horror game, it was confirmed that <em>Halloween</em> will include a story mode and the ability to play against bots, too. As someone who has been disappointed by so many <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game">horror movie franchises</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-game-review-crossplay-ps5-1850752842">getting video game adaptations</a> that are purely online-only, this is good news. And I imagine many other players will agree. <em>Halloween: The Game</em> will also feature “multiple maps” and a soundtrack “inspired by” that of the original <em>Halloween</em> movie. Interestingly, the original film’s director, John Carpenter, is credited as an executive producer on the upcoming game.</p>

 <p>“Working with Compass International Pictures and Further Front has been a dream,” said Charles Brungardt, CEO of IllFonic. “As rights holders of the film and producers on the game, they’ve shared incredible insights to help us stay true to the soul of the 1978 film. Their tremendous passion for Michael Myers has pushed us to craft something that fans of the franchise will truly appreciate.”</p> <p><em>Halloween: The Game</em> is set to launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2026. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Illfonic to see if this project is the same one <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ign-halloween-games-michael-myers-john-carpenter-1851619732">teased back in 2024.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-the-game-you%E2%80%99ve-been-waiting-for-is-worth-the-wait.1276527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Like you, I’ve been waiting what feels like years for Hollow Knight: Silksong. I take that back, it HAS been years waiting for Silksong. The Metroidvania sequel was first announced in 2019, and we barely had a sniff of the game for years. Trailers and talk intensified this year, and it culminated with my special hands-on preview of Hollow Knight: Silksong, in the flesh at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-website-receives-big-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight</a> was utterly captivating. Yes, it was <em>another </em>Metroidvania title, focusing on backtracking and acquiring new abilities to further progression. But its sweet and innocent art style, its cutesy main character, and punishing combat are juxtaposed wonderfully. It was celebrated on launch and continues to be heralded all these years later.</p>



<p>Its legacy can only last so long before people want more—cue Silksong.</p>



<h2 id="h-sing-me-a-sweet-silksong">Sing me a Sweet Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s real, I saw it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Don’t adjust your TV set, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was indeed playable at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamescom 2025</a>. I endured a savage queue of over 2 hours to get a sniff of Silksong. As I’ve said, I love Hollow Knight, but you won’t see such fevered hype and excessive waiting for an ‘indie’ game like this for a while.</p>



<p>The demo build offers two entry points, with one being the beginning of the game and one much further in. As a Metroidvania master (I wish) and someone well-versed in the genre, I did what I didn’t see many other people do, and that’s jump straight into the deep end—was it ego or stupidity, I’ll let you be the judge.</p>



<p>Within seconds, it felt like Hollow Knight. Ori is possibly the only other game that rivals Hollow Knight in terms of presentation. It’s just breathtaking with stuff happening off-screen, and each mini-scene boasts a rich palette of shades and colors. I’ve played mechanically functional titles that looked dull and washed out, whereas Silksong’s verdict is in its name: Silky.</p>



<h2 id="h-crushing-combat-will-question-your-ability">Crushing Combat Will Question Your Ability</h2>



<p>There’s nothing fundamentally different from a movement standpoint. Hornet handles as smoothly as our predecessor, and within minutes, I was slashing away at rocks, piling up my currency, and finding secrets, shortcuts, and nearly drowning in lava-adjacent substances.</p>



<p>It’s not long until I’m thrust into a mini-boss encounter. I’ve had no time to prepare, I’ve quickly familiarized myself with the controls, and I’m met with a gradually building enemy rush of increasing difficulty. Miraculously, I prevail and feel smug—this is likely an encounter you’re not supposed to face until a handful of hours in. I land precise attacks with Hornet and quickly work out the enemy’s attack patterns. Doubt turns to confidence, and I’m ready to take on whatever boss this side of the demo possesses.</p>



<p>The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible. I feel unbeatable, and after finding a key and unlocking the path ahead, I come to the boss—Lace.</p>



<p>I’ll cut to the chase: I die multiple times, and my demo session ends abruptly. I could not match the pace of Lace, and like many Hollow Knight bosses, her attack patterns aren’t ludicrously difficult and staggered like in various <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-non-fromsoftware-soulslike-games-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslikes</a>, but you’ll spam buttons and flail more than a medieval weapon.</p>



<p>Each death brought me closer to a winning effort, and with a few more goes, I think I would’ve overcome the character’s might. But that’s the hook, right? Hollow Knight bosses don’t drag on for 5-10 minutes, but you still feel satiated in your hunger for victory, and you keep going. Ultimately, I walked away from my Silksong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025</a> preview with a smile. </p>



<p>If you’re a Hollow Knight fan, chances are, you’re going to love Silksong. Team Cherry, a release date, please?</p>



<hr>



<p>On a scale of 1-10, how much are you looking forward to Hollow Knight: Silksong? Do you think Hollow Knight is an all-time indie great? Can Silksong better it?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A higher threadcount, you might say.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been lots of excitement over the presence of a Hollow Knight: Silksong game demo on the show floor at Gamescom this year, in both the Xbox and Nintendo booths. And by all accounts, the demo seems pretty great. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">own previewer said</a> it's "a piece of playable art that is as fun to wield as it is to watch." But some Silksong superfans hoping for new story, new bosses, or new content to reveal themselves in this demo might be a little disappointed, because the Gamescom demo is the same demo from six years ago at E3 2019. But shinier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We first noticed this when reading through our previews of the demo from today alongside our preview from 2019. It's more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019">discernable when looking at 2019's video footage</a>, but both demos cover the same two areas - the early game Moss Grotto, and the later Deep Docks. They cover the same encounters and bosses as well. We've been able to comb over some other footage posted by other individuals from Gamescom and yup, looks like an updated version of the same demo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, that's not necessarily a bad thing. If anything, it shows how far the game has come in six years. Looking at similar clips from both demos, and there are very clear signs of polish. Lighting and backgrounds have been adjusted, platforms have been moved around slightly. Fans have even spotted the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mvp03b/a_piece_of_dialogue_between_hornet_and_lace_was/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teensiest, tiniest dialogue change</a> between the two demos. It's also not surprising that neither area has undergone massive content changes in six years. If these two levels were ready for prime time in 2019, they were likely the closest to "done" at the time that Team Cherry had ready, and thus wouldn't need developers to spend years tweaking them infinitely.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Gameplay (Pre-Alpha Build) | gamescom 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks to be an anthology of various Lego-ized Batman movies similar to Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, but even that isn't quite right. It would be more accurate to call it a <em>fusion</em> of Batman movies, alongside other influences and stories, to build something new and original from all of its various parts. In that way, it's perfectly Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, the story mission I played at Gamescom took place in Axis Chemicals, which fans of the 1989 Michael Keaton movie will immediately recognize as the birthplace of the Joker. But instead of gangster sociopath Jack Napier being dispatched to destroy incriminating evidence in the chemical plant (but with the situation becoming a setup to kill him for sleeping with the boss' moll), it's Red Hood #1, leader of the Red Hood Gang, as we've seen serve as the Joker origin story in some comic iterations. Red Hood is using the factory to manufacture a strange new compound that makes its victims laugh uncontrollably until they die. Under the hood is an unmistakable (and very passable) Jack Nicholson impression, so the character is not <em>not</em> the Batman '89 Joker, but he's been blended with other stories.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the Batman who confronts him, at least in this demo, was the Robert Pattinson iteration of the character, accompanied by a Jim Gordon who looks very much like a Lego Jeffrey Wright, each of them from the 2022 film The Batman.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553511"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553511-lego_batman_gothamcity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This mixing and matching of various great moments from Batman cinematic history is core to the spirit of Legacy of the Dark Knight, which sets the ambitious target of weaving elements of all of the Batman movies with other media into a single coherent story. When asked what that means for recurring characters played by different actors like the Joker, TT Games' Jonathan Smith told GameSpot that perhaps some terrible things will happen to the Joker that will make him even more sinister and--presumably, but left unsaid--more like Heath Ledger's incarnation in The Dark Knight.</p><p dir="ltr">That same sense of playfulness extends to the Easter eggs, which have always been a Lego staple but feel more focused here. Rather than collecting a hundred doodads to unlock 200 different but mechanically identical characters, you're unlocking deep-cut styles for Batman and Commissioner Gordon. Those include some you'd expect, like iconic movie appearances, alongside some you might not. Batman looked especially great in his Brave and the Bold costume modeled after the 2008 cartoon show.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Batman and Gordon have looks based on their very first comic appearances, including Bats' dopey big cowl ears and Gordon's white suit and wispy mustache. The most surprising was <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Detective_Comics_Vol_1_241" rel="nofollow ">Batman's Rainbow Suit</a>, a fully rendered Lego version of a classic and extremely goofy Silver Age comic book that has received iconic camp status.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553510"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4553510-lego_batman_batmobile.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But not content to borrow solely from great Batman movies, Legacy of the Dark Knight also borrows from great Batman games. The combat is clearly inspired by the Arkham series, as Batman can perform stealth takedowns of unsuspecting Lego enemies or jump into the middle of a brawl with timing-based combat. This is simplified in some ways--the timing windows are wider and the visual indicators are bigger than in the Arkham games, and you only have two gadgets to use in fights. But it feels like an affectionate homage to mechanics that have become as central to the character as any movie, in the minds of Arkham fans. Legacy of the Dark Knight also introduces difficulty levels, letting younger or less-experienced players THWACK and POW like Batman, while giving more experienced Arkham fans more and tougher enemies to fight and, for the first time I remember, a limited pool of lives to spend on encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the later Arkham games, the hub world is a wide-open Gotham City that can be explored freely. You can stop crimes, find Bat caches, smash collectibles like Penguin rubber duckies, and skulk along the rooftops or gracefully glide between them. You can zip-line your way up to gain speed and then float, and if you've built up enough energy from beating down thugs, you can launch even higher into the air to get a birds-eye view of the city. If going ground-level is more your style, you can summon a Batmobile anywhere in the open world. I only saw the Robert Pattinson muscle car iteration from The Batman in my demo, but TT Games has already teased many more Batmobiles to come, and they can be freely equipped like Batman and Gordon's costumes.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't really know what to expect next out of TT Games after The Skywalker Saga, but Legacy of the Dark Knight is such a pleasant surprise. When you're finished building a Lego set, you might take it apart and see what else you can make from all the pieces. TT Games looks to be doing that with the Batman mythos, and I can't wait to see what they build out of it.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework, the modular computer company, just released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">its first delightful tiny desktop PC</a>, on top of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/688959/framework-laptop-12-review-modular-touchscreen-intel">smallest laptop yet</a>. But it’s already teasing its next big live announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZRG7Og61mw">on YouTube</a> for August 26th at 8am PT / 11am ET, saying it’ll reveal how “something big just got better.”</p><p>While that may seem like a vague phrase, it might narrow things down quite a bit! Framework only has one existing “big” product other than the Framework Desktop, the one that mysteriously <em>didn’t</em> get an update at its last event in February.</p><div><p>I’m talking, of course, about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24047424/framework-laptop-16-review">the Framework Laptop 16, the most ambitious and most modular laptop ever made</a>. When I tracked down Framework CEO Nirav Patel in February, he told me that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">was “nowhere near done”</a> with the laptop just yet.</p></div><p>Or, maybe Framework will help fisherman change how they catch fish in New England? That’s what Google Search tells me, anyhow:</p><p>I think the Framework Laptop 16 is a safer bet, though.</p><p>I’ve been quietly frustrated that I haven’t been able to give the Laptop 16 my full recommendation yet — because I want products like this to exist! — partly because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">early cooling and build quality</a> deficiencies, and partly because Framework has never truly promised that you’ll be able to actually upgrade its GPU to a more powerful one down the road.</p><p>But with Framework’s Laptop 13, the company has proved again and again that truly modular and upgradable laptops can be a reality, and it’s ironed out many issues along the way. Here’s hoping August 26th is the day it fulfills the promise of modular gaming / creator laptops as well.</p><div><p>BTW, in case you missed it: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast/623633/james-bond-amazon-framework-laptop-desktop-vergecast">We had Nirav on <em>The Vergecast</em> in March</a> to chat all things Framework.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763037/framework-is-teasing-a-big-update-for-august-26th-could-it-be-framework-16]]></content:encoded>
