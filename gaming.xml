            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/talking-death-roll-show-camp-rend-horror-and-indie-production-with-frankie-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Death Roll Show is a new indie TTRPG Actual Play with a focus on taking different horror styles and adapting them into short anthology adventures. On October 11th the first season of Death Roll Show: Camp Rend will be released. To talk about Camp Rend, indie TTRPG creations, and how to get your own start in the space I sat down with the Creator, Executive Producer, and DM for Camp Rend, Frankie Nicks, as well as Producer and performer, KP.</p>
<p>As always I like to start at the beginning so I asked Nicks how the premise for Death Roll Show originated. Nicks explained that a friend of his owns a production company that focuses on creating "B-movie horror type special effects and gore" Nicks explained that he's been attempting to get his friend to do a project with him but "he just has never been interested. He's not big into TTRPG or <em>D&amp;D</em>. I think he played a couple of times in High School when I dragged him along. Every time I pitched it he didn't get it, I ended up finally getting him to watch <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Dropout </a>enough to where he got interested and he really appreciated how Dropout as a company was structured with lots of employee involvement and profit sharing and so then I was able to show him Dimension 20, show him how successful those things were so to get the company involved I pitched 'we could do something horror related'"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//_1SkLBNVn5Y"></iframe></p>
<p>Nicks explained that he had always had a love of horror growing up "Obviously <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15ae2b87-cf24-463c-b903-4dadaf6c28ea" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/friday-13th-horror-at-camp-crystal-lake-review"><em>Friday the 13th</em></a> and all that stuff, but I was more into the weird kinda stuff like catseye that always had little stories. That's where I got the anthology idea because I also wanted to pitch it in a way that would be smart commercially." Nicks rallied off the benefits of keeping it small in the TTRPG space, it would need just a single location, minimal set work, and they could shoot all four episodes in a day.</p>
<p>Camp Rend is a slasher season that will focus on a group of campers and their camp counselors as if something is attacking them. Referencing back to his last answer about creating something easily definable Nicks explained "we chose this genre specifically because not only a love for everything of the 80s and the past, but being on a short budget we could use a VHS filter in editing to hide production"</p>
<p>Nicks took me behind the production curtain a bit explaining that there was a lot of planning that went into making sure they could create as high a production end product knowing that they didn't have the budget to have 6 Production Assistants on hand-checking every single shot.</p>
<p>As I heard from both Nicks and KP it was clear to see not just how much passion they had for the project, but also how much respect they had for all of the work each other and the entire production crew and cast had put into creating Camp Rend. Each was constantly trying to follow up from the other making corrections to ensure each got the credit they were due.</p>

<p>Nicks also spoke about his aspirations for what a second season and beyond would look like. Writing for Camp Rend began only six month ago, knowing that these productions can be small and turned around on a tight schedule.</p>
<p>"What I'm glad about the team is we're all very positive and looking toward the horizon in what we want to do. We have ideas for a Sci-Fi one, a very cult-like/witchy vibe one almost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch"><em>Blair Witch Project</em></a> style." KP explained to me "Not only in terms of storyline wise but also in terms of how can it be manifested on-screen in a unique way."</p>
<p>KP teased that they already have three or four ideas for ways they could introduce interesting mechanics, such as the Jenga Block tower, to other settings to create distinct experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Camp Rend Is A Unique <em>D&amp;D</em>-Hybrid Experience</h2>
<p>Camp Rend uses <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as its base, each of the characters are built to level 5 using the<em> D&amp;D</em> rules, but there's an added twist that the Jenga Block tower system from <em>Dread </em>is implemented to assist with ever-increasing stakes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=gFSfZwsD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=R309uR9g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"The biggest [mechanic] you can see from our trailer is using the Jenga Tower" KP explained "Using that as a system to elevate the stress and impact of decisions that are being made. D&amp;D and all of these games players are typically very powerful and it's very easy to lose that sense of dread. We wanted to bring that back into the show and ensure that as players and characters we felt the fear that came from being in the situation."</p>
<p>Nicks explained "I was trying to find a way to increase the stakes. I tried a couple of different things first, I tried some test games borrowing adversity tokens from Kids on Bikes, trying an anti-adversity system, I workshopped a system with a skill game with a bar but I kept coming back to the tower."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's perfect because it's a little bit of skill involved but there is a rule that if you touch it you take it, so no tippy tappies"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A look of disbelief and shellshock came over KPs face as this rule was disclosed. He reinforced that the consequences were very real in the game and it's not something that any rules in D&amp;D can save you from.</p>
<p>KP and Nicks started to reference a moment from the trailer as KP pulled a block. KP highlighted how real the feeling of success was for him in that moment. Nicks added laughing that that was the moment he thought "Ok, we might have something here. That was the proof of concept. I wanted to find a way to bring up the tension but as more blocks are pulled you know it's going to be harder."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-wound-makeup.jpg?itok=pb6kjwVJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-wound-makeup.jpg?itok=r4t3ivDf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Battle Damage The Audience Can See</h2>
<p>On top of the Jenga Tower another unique aspect to appeal to the audience is the live battle damage that will occur to the players as they get in danger.</p>
<p>Colin Fleetwood, the director, got the kudos for coming up with the idea of adding blood, but Nicks explained it was something they stumbled into. "When Colin accepted a deal and we got to talking production details it came about because he didn't understand the medium completely."</p>
<p>Nicks described miscommunications on the need for a set, Fleetwood believing it would take all of their budget before Nicks explained it just needed to be a static space with a table "like a play".</p>
<p>"When I was trying to explain that if I beat his armor class I could cut him and he said 'do they get damaged?' and I explained yeah they might have a gash and he said 'so we'll do the makeup for that?'" Through conversation they were able to figure out that blood could be set up in 5-30 minutes</p>
<p>Nicks joked that he hadn't seen anything like that in AP before, a progression of battle damage, and right as they were filming Dimension 20's latest season <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> had DM Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> get bloodier with each episode.</p>

<p>KP took some time to introduce me to his character for Camp Rend, Camp Councelor Virin. "He is all about the camp, this is probably his second or third year working at Camp Rend. He comes from a local druid circle in the nearby forest and he does not like it. He hates the idea of being stuck in the past and being all nature-esce:</p>
<p>We shared laughs as both of our thoughts turned to the idea that Virin was a druid on the equivalent of his rumspringa.</p>
<p>KP expressed his love for being part of Death Role Show not only as a player, but that it was a production that made him feel like it was something he helped create. "When I was on the show and I got to experienc ethe story and the production I personally felt in that moment no one else is doing something like this, it's very cool and I'm imagining how we can take this to the next level. As someone who came from a Project Management background I know how I can help, what is a Producer but a Product Manager for the media world."</p>
<p>From there KP was able to get involved in creating pitch decks, crafting a media kit, and took over the reigns of the social media for Death Roll Show. The key of it all is that KP expressed his desire to make sure Death Roll Show could be a complete success.</p>

<p>Knowing that Nicks and KP had taken the first of many difficult steps into the realm of Actual Plays, playing on different tables and now producing their own shows I wondered what tips could be offered to those who might be hesitant to take their first steps.</p>
<p>For Nicks he was able to immediately offer what might be simple advice to hear, but to put in practice is much harder. "Keep trying, don't give up. I know that sounds lame but when I first started auditioning I had a very bad experience. It soured me on it and I almost left. You're going to have bad experiences, we know in this world there are gatekeepers and bad actors but a run in with one of those can sour you. Just work through that at your own pace and if you can get to the other side of it there are amazing people you'll get to meet."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Think big, if you have an idea and you think it's good then think big"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KPs advice came from a bit of a stranger place, an adult film director, who said "Everyone is fuckable" After pausing to laugh for a moment KP took the time to explain what he meant. "There's someone out there that will look at you and think 'I will smash that' and for any idea that you have there is someone out there that will see it and say 'I want to smash that idea.'"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-slasher-aesthetics.jpg?itok=7hKDwAJm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-slasher-aesthetics.jpg?itok=2113nVms 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"A lot of people tend to want to make it big and make a huge audience. You have to remember even if you have ten people who watch your show you have to remember what ten people in a room looks like. When you see a number that looks like 100, compared to others that might seem small but you've got to imagine 100 people watching you perform. I feel like we're losing our perspective on how big that is."</p>
<h2>Short And Sweet Story</h2>
<p>Death Roll Show's first season, Camp Rend will start airing on the 10th of October and will air for the next four Thursdays concluding on Halloween night. KP did make a joke about how there is another Actual Play that airs on Thursdays that "a lot of people tend to be Critical about" but reinforced the idea that their episodes aren't just airing earlier but will each be in the 45-60 minute range making it easier to digest.</p>

            <p>
Pathologic, the acclaimed plague-themed horror series from developer Ice-Pick Lodge, is returning for a third instalment, this time slinging time travel into its gruelling, emotionally draining mix of intentionally dispiriting survival and haunting theatrics.
</p>
<p>
The newly announced Pathologic 3 is something of an oddity in that it's technically, sort of, the second chunk of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> - itself a half sequel and half (much-improved) remake of Ice-Pick Lodge's cult-classic 2005 original. Pathological 1 - which, as with all entries in the series, charts the sudden decline of a strange, small town on the edge of the Russian Steppe as it slowly succumbs to a mysterious plague - memorably had three playable characters and three distinct routes through its 12 days of increasing misery: that of Artemy Burakh (the Haruspex), Daniil Dankovsky (the Batchelor), and Clara (the Changeling).
</p>
<p>
Due to financial concerns, however, only the Haruspex path made it into Pathologic 2, and while Dankovsky did appear as the protagonist in a short standalone episode, titled The Marble Nest, his full path will now be the focus of Pathologic 3 - albeit significantly expanded.
</p>

<p>
Dankovsky is a young doctor and expert in thanatology who travels to Pathologic's mysterious town at the start of the outbreak in order to advance his research on death. As with the Haruspex's path, Dankovsky has 12 days to stop the plague, using all the tools of his medical trade. He can, explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">Pathologic 3's Steam page</a>, examine potions and diagnose diseases, cross-check symptoms and prescribe treatments, impose quarantines and curfews, confiscate medicine, vaccinate the population, deploy patrols, and more. 
</p><p>
Crucially, though, Dankovsky now also wields the power of time, and can travel forward to witness the future, or go backward to correct mistakes of the past. "Anything you see can tell a story and become a piece of your mental map of the world," explains Ice-Pick. "Explore the town for new insights, notice details, and connect the dots. Uncover the secrets of the town's inhabitants. Shape their stories, decide their fates, and talk to their shadows."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything we know about Pathologic 3 right now, but  the current plans is to release it for PC some time next year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can%E2%80%99t-afford-to-ignore-these-tasks-before-diving-into-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred.1003206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first major expansion for Diablo 4 is finally upon us, with a brand-new class—Spiritborne—a new zone to explore, unique gameplay mechanics, and major reworks and overhauls for core gameplay systems that totally revamp how you play Diablo 4. It’s a lot to ingest, and it’s easy for new and returning players to feel overwhelmed. Well, to help you out, we’ve compiled a few of the things you should do before Vessel of Hatred!</p>



<h2 id="h-change-campaigns">Change Campaigns</h2>



<p>After purchasing and downloading Vessel of Hatred, upon release, you’ll want to start a brand-new character to dive into the expansion and subsequent season. However, the game doesn’t jump straight into the new content. You need to tell it where to go.</p>



<p>At the end of character creation, you can ‘Change Campaign State’ to ‘Start with the Vessel of Hatred Campaign,’ and you absolutely should choose this option. Otherwise, you’ll start either in Kyovashad once again, like every other prior season, or you’ll begin the main Diablo 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-campaign-diablo-4-before-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story mode from the beginning</a>. Well, you’ll still start in Kyovashad, but there’s a quest in the main city to kickoff the new expansion.</p>



<h2 id="h-acquire-renown-and-altars-of-lilith">Acquire Renown and Altars of Lilith</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll want to run through Sanctuary acquiring every single Altar of Lilith and increasing your Renown within each zone. Every Altar provides a unique buff, usually additional stat bonuses, like Dexterity or Strength, along with the occasional Murmuring Obol capacity increase or an extra Paragon Point. They’re worthwhile, as starting a new character with all of the Altars provides you a significant power buff straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Renown allows you to claim bonus XP, gold, skill points, additional Potion Capacity, Max Obols, and Paragon Points from the Region Progress hub, which is, once again, a nice power buff for a new character!</p>



<h2 id="h-focus-on-mercenaries">Focus on Mercenaries</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting a new character and venturing from Kyovashad to Nahantu, the blacksmith Rahair will introduce you to the new Mercenary mechanics, which allow you to bring an NPC companion along with you. They’re immensely useful when you want to play solo and clear content quickly. Oh, and a second one will occasionally pop up to deal damage before disappearing into the night.</p>



<p>But first and foremost, before you get too excited and leap headfirst into the Vessel of Hatred campaign, complete the Mercenary missions to increase your rapport with each new character. The unique abilities each Mercenary unlocks with Rapport XP really does make a difference in the new content.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-about-vessel-of-hatred">What You Need to Know About Vessel of Hatred</h2>



<p>Before diving into all of the new content available in Diablo 4, there’s a few things you should know beforehand, as a lot of key changes come to the game alongside the new expansion, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>This first expansion includes a level squish, bringing the max player level down from 100 to 60.</li>



<li>The World Tier difficulty system is completely revamped and now includes Torment-like tiers instead of World Tier I-IV.</li>



<li>The max Paragon level is now 300.</li>



<li>Everyone receives two new character slots.</li>



<li>Every class receives additional Skills and Passives</li>



<li>Party Finder is finally in the game for group content.</li>



<li>Seasonal content and rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Specifically to those who purchase the expansion, you will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nahantu</li>



<li>Spiritborne</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatred campaign</li>



<li>Runewords</li>



<li>Dark Citadel</li>



<li>Mercenaries</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatres-specific resource trading mechanics</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 made over $1 billion in revenue</a>? It’s a positively staggering amount but not surprising in the least bit considering the cost of cosmetics available in the in-game store!</p>

Even if you’ve never watched the iconic anime, you’ve probably heard Harris’ work on the show because the phrase “find out on the next episode of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>” or some variation has become a long-running joke on the internet.</p><p>Harris narrated the show for over 223 episodes between 1996 and 2003, though that role eventually went to Kyle Hebert, who voices Gohan in the anime. Hebert’s take on the narrator is near-identical to Harris’ booming, guttural delivery, so even if he’s been gone from the franchise for 20 years, his impact can still be felt in more recent dubs of the series. Sadly, Jōji Yanami, the narrator for the Japanese version of the series up until his retirement in 2015, passed away in 2021.</p><p>Harris isn’t the only loss the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise has had to endure in 2024, as series creator Akira Toriyama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780">passed away in March</a></span>. His final posthumous works included the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sand-land-game-akira-toriyama-manga-anime-1851432565&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sand-land-game-akira-toriyama-manga-anime-1851432565"><em>Sand Land</em> RPG</a></span> that launched in April, and the upcoming anime <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-daima-akira-toriyama-new-york-comic-con-1850922709&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-daima-akira-toriyama-new-york-comic-con-1850922709"><em>Dragon Ball Daima</em></a></span>. With the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise still a cultural mainstay to this day, it’s easy to forget that it’s approaching its 40th year, until we get news like this. Time marches on.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The <em>Alien&nbsp;</em>franchise is about uncaring monsters, unfeeling corporations, and horrific, claustrophobic terror. Given this setting, it almost made sense, what happened to the original <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>
<p>The game was released to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">positive reviews</a>, is now considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best#2014">one of the best games ever made</a>, and sold more than 2 million copies within its first few months. Despite this, <em>Isolation</em> only got "close to break-even or just about in the black," then-Creative Assembly studio director Tim Heaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/web/20170427202334/http://go.skimresources.com/?id=87431X1540261&amp;site=eurogamer.net&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesindustry.biz%2Farticles%2F2015-09-30-sega-europe-were-definitely-on-the-right-track&amp;xguid=&amp;xuuid=638630bcdcb174d5fd1afe32be6f2553&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20170427202705%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true&amp;xtz=0">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> a year after release. With the rapid evolution of AAA game development, that wasn't enough. And so, like a salvage team diverted to a bio-weapon recovery mission, <em>Isolation</em> and its momentum were seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true">abandoned</a>.</p>

      Gameplay and review accolades for <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, released 10 years ago today.

<p>Abandoned, that is, until today, the 10th anniversary of that game's 2014 release. The appropriately named Al Hope, creative director of <em>Isolation&nbsp;</em>studio Creative Assembly, <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that his team had "heard your distress calls loud and clear," and could confirm that "a sequel to <em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is in early development."</p>
<p>The original game stands out to this day for its bold yet entirely appropriate take on making an&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> game. You play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of iconic heroine Ellen Ripley, working for Weyland-Yutani in a welding job. You get a chance to find out more about what happened to your mother, but—you'll never believe it—things go terribly wrong, and now you are hunted.</p>

Murray is referring to previous criticism he received about playing Call of Duty too much, which came after he signed a new contract with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfls-patrick-peterson-roasts-kyler-murray-with-video-game-themed-celebration-after-interception/1100-6508760/">"independent study" clause</a>, which was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/cardinals-remove-independent-study-clause-from-kyler-murray-s-contract">later removed</a>. The clause stated Murray must spend four hours a week focused on studying football film, without other distractions, something that is <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBrandt/status/1551668817348141058">relatively unheard</a> of for starting quarterbacks in the NFL.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsDzb5CWsTY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OsDzb5CWsTY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After the contract clause was put in the public spotlight, rumors circulated that it was due to Murray playing too much Call of Duty.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pathologic 3 - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Set in a small town located in Russia's remote steppes in the early 1900's, Pathologic follows the story of three main characters: Artemy Burakh ("The Haruspex"), a local healer returning to his hometown to address a recent tragedy; Danil Dankovsky ("The Bachelor"), a certified doctor visiting from the city in the hopes of uncovering a scientific breakthrough; and Clara ("The Changeling"), a mysterious young girl who has the ability to save (or end) lives with a single touch of her hands, but has no idea how or why she arrived in the town. There's no word yet regarding when players might get their hands on Clara's version of events, but after the announcement of Pathologic 3, it stands to reason that Clara's playthrough is also in the works.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pathologic/">original Pathologic</a> launched to critical acclaim in Russia in 2005, and also earned a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cult following of players</a> from around the world. The original game was later followed up by a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/384110/Pathologic_Classic_HD/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remastered version</a> featuring better graphics and an improved English translation. Both versions of the game allow players to complete each protagonist's story in its entirety, with each playthrough revealing more info about the strange disease that's rapidly killing the town's inhabitants. Each protagonist must find a cure for the disease using their unique skills, while also working to uncover the truth behind the source of the outbreak. But the game's main characters face far bigger challenges than the plague itself, and must find a way to work around lying NPCs, the general breakdown of law and order as the town gets progressively sicker, and an impending military invasion which is sure to result in the town's destruction if it isn't stopped.</p><p>The series was rebooted in 2019 with the release of Pathologic 2, which only featured Artemy Burakh's storyline--though Ice-Pick Lodge promised the other two playable protagonists were in development. Unfortunately, complications regarding Russia's war in Ukraine (which the game's developers have <a href="https://x.com/IcePickLodge/status/1498269141404463107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">publicly denounced</a>) caused complications leading to a delay in the release of Danil Dankovsky's storyline. Fans of the franchise have been waiting years for an update regarding the next chapter in the Pathologic franchise, and now--nearly five years later--they finally have it.</p>

		<p>Over the weekend, we finally said goodbye to our dog Pixel. Funny enough, I did not nerd name that dog. She was a chihuahua found on the streets, and the woman who helped rehabilitate her had run out of names for tiny dogs, so she opened up a thesaurus to the word small, her finger landed on "pixel," and the rest was history. It seemed silly to rename her. She was a good dog, like most dogs, even if our children never got a chance to see that side of her. It was a tough decision, but she's in a better place now, wherever that might be. A weight has been lifted, and I will drown my sorrows in lots of spooky media this week.</p><p>-pk, who keeps closing Pixel's gate for the stairs, even if he doesn't have to anymore</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>How many times should a person let a fridge malfunction and spoil an entire batch of groceries before you replace it? Find out on the latest episode of HOA, folks! I think if this happened in our home, my wife would flip out so fast over the wasted food—one of her absolute pet peeves—that I wouldn't be allowed to do <em>anything</em> I'd sorted out getting the fridge replaced. Rob and I have also started writing our next letter series, this time focused on the role the movie theater does (or doesn't) play in our lives these days. Oh, and I got to record a patently ridiculous interview you'll hear later this month lol</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> Even though it's pushing My Turn out of order, we've all seen Francis Ford Coppola's <em>Megalopolis</em>, so we might as well record an episode about watching <em>Megalopolis</em>. You'll hear that next week. Drop your questions in now for what is sure to be an <em>interesting</em> discussion about an <em>interesting</em> movie. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdThqHvDA1mZZitu9DAb33xsWh-ji76_3AD2uhxmkidIrRgug/viewform?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">You can drop any questions or observations about the movie into this form.</a> Also, in the afternoon, Rob and Janet will be playing a lil' soccer with <em>FC 25</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>We'll record Remap Radio—yes, I've been playing <em>Silent Hill 2</em>—before Rob and Cado hop on Twitch to run through a bunch of games both of them have wanted to try playing. Why not play them in front of you, too? I'll also be guesting on <em>Nextlander </em>to discuss the anthology movie <em>Trick 'r Treat.</em></li><li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> In the evening, I'll be returning to the world of spooky games. I ordered a night vision web cam that should show up on Wednesday, too. Still figuring out what we're going to play, but a few options I've been kicking around: <em>Mouthwashing, Amnesia: The Bunker</em>, and<em> Unsorted Horror</em>. I'm also still bitter that I've never beaten the <em>Friday the 13th </em>game for the NES. A new daily game? This stream will kick off after I'm able to help get the kids into bed.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Remap Radio will be in your feed nice 'n early. We may toss a bonus stream on the fire, but we're leaving our options open at the moment. You'll also get to read the latest letter series from Rob and I on Friday morning.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is almost out in early access, and players not well-versed with the game’s mechanics might find the PvP mode a bit troublesome. As we all know, the best defense is a good offense, and this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Defence guide will take you through this system’s fundamentals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defending can be tricking in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, as you are always vulnerable to a barrage of explosions, Ki blasts, punches and kicks. When you find yourself in these dire situations, there are 4 Defense mechanics that you can use in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Guarding, Recovery, Counters and Evasion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-defend-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">How to Defend in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<h3 id="h-guarding">Guarding</h3>



<p>Using Guards is the most basic form of Defense in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. You must press R1/RB while inputting an Up or Down direction to perform a High or Low Guard. Players should know that guarding for too long can also be detrimental, as a Guard Break will put you in a vulnerable position.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery">Recovery</h3>



<p>Recovery is a quick way to get back into action in the game. There are two ways to recover: Ground/Wall recovery, executed by pressing down before hitting a wall or ground, and Dragon Dash recovery, which lets you take the fight back to your opponent directly. It can be performed by pressing up before hitting the ground or wall.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-counters">Counters</h3>



<p>Counters is the new Defense system in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, and it can be divided into four parts: Super Perception, Z-Counters, Revenge Counter, and Super Counters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Perception can be performed by holding O/B before getting hit by an opponent’s attack. However, its cost will vary from Ki to Skill count depending on the counterattack. Super Perception will allow players to perform Sonic Sway, which is almost an MUI Goku way to dodge attacks when faced with a Rush Attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Z-counters must be performed before an opponent hits the player with a Vanishing Assault; you must press R1/RB to execute the move. The Z-Counter continues until one of the players mistimes the input. Also, the damage inflicted will increase depending on how long the Z-Counters the encounter was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Revenge Counters are the best way to get out of a sticky situation. However, they do cost a Skill Count. The Revenge Counter can counter any attack, whether melee or blast attack and can also be used while you are being attacked. It is one of the strongest defense moves in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and can be performed by pressing the R3/R stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Counter is another move players can use for most attacks, and it can be used when being attacked, too. However, timing is critical. To perform this move, press up along with Square/X and send your opponent flying away.</p>

<h3 id="h-evasion-nbsp">Evasion&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The last defense system for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is Evasion, and players can evade in two ways; High-Speed Evasion and Step-in Sway. High-Speed Evasion is performed by pressing R1/RB right before specific attacks to evade them and create an opening for a counter. Step-in Sway allows you to evade an attack by pressing X/A and R1/RB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a big week last week for Cloud9’s Valorant team, as the competitors walked out of the Red Bull Home Ground North American Qualifier with first place. With Sentinels falling back in second place, Cloud9 will now advance to the Red Bull Home Ground Finals, taking place towards the end of November.</p>



<p>Cloud9’s North American Valorant Team Manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnypulatie">Johnny Pulatie</a>, gave his thoughts in an exclusive interview with Insider Gaming exiting the event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cloud9-valorant-team-manager-discusses-competition-after-team-qualifies-to-berlin">Cloud9 Valorant Team Manager Discusses Competition After Team Qualifies to Berlin</h2>



<p>With the North American qualifier officially over and Cloud9 now preparing for the Finals in Berlin, Johnny Pulatie had quite a bit of insight to share following the event.</p>



<p>“With how important Red Bull Home Ground is to Cloud9 and to continue our storied history with the main event, we knew we had to bring together the best roster possible to compete in and win the NA Qualifier,” said Pulatie in an exclusive interview.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team had been working to prepare for the event while also having to bring in a few stand-ins, who were not able to practice with the team before the tournament began in Seattle. </p>



<p>“Our highest priority was to sit down as a team to walk through our game plan for the event and make everyone on the team as comfortable as possible. We knew that if we were comfortable, we would naturally enter the flow state and be able to dominate any team.”</p>



<p>This comfortability clearly showed through the team’s competitiveness during the qualifier after Cloud9 beat Team Sentinels 2-0 in the Finals.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pulatie-discusses-grand-finals-in-berlin-and-how-the-team-is-preparing">Pulatie Discusses Grand Finals in Berlin and How the Team is Preparing</h2>



<p>Now, the team will have to face the real challenge, as the players prepare to travel to Berlin this November for the Red Bull Home Ground Finals. After competing last year in the Japan Finals, Cloud9 is ready to continue its legacy as one of the best Valorant teams out there.</p>



<p>“The team is currently boot camping at the T1 facility in Seoul, South Korea to make sure the team chemistry, culture, teamwork, and comfortability are high right away so we can hit the ground running,” said Pulatie.</p>



<p>The event will take place from November 20 to 23, 2024, giving fans quite the action to make up for VCT being in its off-season. Cloud9’s North American Valorant team will also be competing in the 20254 Sentinels City Classic, which is set to take place at the beginning of November in Los Angeles, California.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/pathologic-3-revealed-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pathologic 3 has been revealed by Ice-Pick Lodge and HypeTrain Digital, with this being a follow up to Pathologic 2 which was released in 2019. Pathologic 2 was actually a reboot of the original Pathologic that was released in 2005. That had three characters who were the Changeling, the Haruspex, and the Bachelor. The 2019 reboot focused solely on the Haruspex, while Pathologic 3 will focus on the Bachelor.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pathologic 3 Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zb0C2WYUjkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pathologic 3, The Bachelor is a doctor who has come to the small town in an attempt to find an immortal man, and defeat death. The Bachelor only has 12 days to complete this impossible mission, but he has an advantage as he access to a time travel mechanic. While trying to defeat death, players will also be influencing events in the town, and trying to help the townspeople as an epidemic sweeps through the population.</p>
<p><span>Ice Pick Lodge founder Nikolay Dybowski, said, “<em>We are making a game about how a person develops their mind to learn how to work with things they previously couldn’t or didn’t know how to notice. Our goal is to understand what this means for the player. Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves. That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect. We can describe the concept of this mechanic as surrealist time management. Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path. We want to show the player the possibility of existing in a world that is disassembled and functions in a way quite different from what we’re used to expecting.”</em></span></p>

<p>Pathologic 3 is due to release in 2025 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-director-says-the-remakes-differences-are-mediocre-save-for-the-camera/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Silent Hill 2 director Masashi Tsuboyama <a href="https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842185991496614263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> to talk about his feelings on the remake that's due to launch tomorrow. Tsuboyama-san, who has since worked in the art department of a few Nintendo games (most recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a>), criticized differences like 4K, 'photorealism', and the bonus headgear, labeling as mediocre. However, he praised the camera change as a major improvement for the remake.</p>
<p><em>I think the value of the Silent Hill 2 remake is that a new generation can play it. As a creator, I'm very happy about it. It's been 23 years! Even if you don't know the original, you can just enjoy the remake as it is. Whether it's good or bad doesn't affect the original.</em></p>
<p><em>The differences between the original and the remake, 4K, Photorealism, the bonus headgear, etc. are all mediocre. Who is this promotion going to appeal to? It seems like they're not doing enough to convey the appeal of the work to the generation that doesn't know Silent Hill.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing to note is the change in camera (perspective). The change in playable camera has a significant impact on many aspects, combat, level design, art creation, etc. While the impact on the story may be relatively small, it brings a big change to the playfeel of the game. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with the playable camera from 23 years ago. Depth and angle were limited by the processing load. It was a continuous process of hard work that was not rewarded. But that was the limit. </em><em>The over-the-shoulder view definitely adds to the sense of realism. In other words, it makes me want to try playing the even more immersive remake of Silent Hill 2.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake officially launches tomorrow, although pre-orders of the digital deluxe already have access to the game, and user reviews on Steam are already overwhelmingly positive (96%). This lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own review of the game</a>, where Chris Wray wrote:</p>
<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragori-games-announces-tanares-expeditions-epic-pirate-adventure-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragori Games has announced a new board game coming to Gamefound. The game is <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em>, a swashbuckling pirate adventure set in the studio's original fantasy setting.</p>
<h2>The Tanares Expeditions Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players. It is a standalone experience where players take on the role of pirate heroes as they attempt to stop something from drowning the world of Tanares in corruption and despair. The game will feature four brand-new heroes, with more to come in the future.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=4zjjvn1R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=3De-FjXb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay of <em>Tanares Expeditions</em> is a blend of a classic dungeon-crawler and a roguelite. Through quests, characters will grow stronger, allowing them to develop powerful combos. Combos are a staple of Tanares' series gameplay, allowing you to engage in combat even when it isn't your turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While designing the mechanics and pace of Expeditions, I aimed to capture what fans truly love about Tanares while introducing something fresh and exciting," explains Alexandre Aboud, lead game designer for Expeditions. "Inspired by the fantastic Slay the Spire, players can expect constant adaptation and growth with the new roguelite-inspired mechanics we're bringing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is the latest entry in the Tanares adventure series. It began in 2018 with Dragori's first game, <em>Arena: The Contest</em> in 2018. Since then, the studio has expanded the series through several successfully crowdfunded board games.</p>
<p>These projects include <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/dragori-games/tanares-adventures-ultimate-edition"><em>Tanares Adventures</em></a>, a co-op adventure that garnered critical acclaim, and over $2.8 million during its initial campaign, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg"><em>Tanares RPG</em></a>, a TTRPG using the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> 5e ruleset set in the world of high fantasy, political intrigue, and eldritch horror.</p>
<p>At time of writing, details are scarce on Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea. Its Gamefound campaign is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg">in preview</a>, but will officially launch November 19.</p>

And that makes sense. The OG <em>Silent Hill 2,</em> which released on PS2 back in 2001, is still considered by many to be the best horror game ever made. But some of these fans aren’t happy about changes made in the remake, like the new over-the-shoulder camera.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/7-best-strikers-for-ea-sports-fc-25-career-mode.1003101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-strikers-ea-sports-fc-25-career-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Strikers get the job done at the end – be it a last-minute goal or outrunning the defenders using their sheer speed, they can turn the tide of a match at any moment. However, having the best strikers early on in EA Sports FC 25 Career Mode can be a challenge.</p>



<p>First of all, you have to take three factors into consideration – Age, Cost, and Pace. The younger, faster, and cheaper the players are, the better their chances will be to shine during the later stages of their careers when the stakes are higher and the competition is fiercer.</p>



<p>Let’s now take a look at seven of the best Strikers you can sign in EA Sports FC 25 Career Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-paris-brunner">Paris Brunner</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 68</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 66</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 51</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 67</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 27</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 59</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Paris Josua Brunner is the youngest forward on our list who is currently aged 18 and plays for the Belgian Pro League club Cercle Brugge. His overall stats make him a good choice for your Career Mode as he has the potential to reach an 87 rating after a few years.</p>



<p>His wages and transfer budget are lower than all the players we’ve mentioned here and that makes him an underrated choice for your Club.</p>



<h2 id="h-semih-kilicsoy">Semih Kılıçsoy</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 74</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 60</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 75</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 31</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 71</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Semih Kılıçsoy, currently 19 years old, plays as a forward for Beşiktaş and Turkey. He is a right-footed player and could be one of the top picks for Career Mode in EA Sports FC 25.</p>



<p>His market value won’t be too high which means you can nurture this young talent to prepare for your club’s future. This Turkish forward’s stats are pretty balanced, with a 79 sprint speed and 77 finishing means you can use him as a substitute during the first few years at your club.</p>



<h2 id="h-karim-konate">Karim Konaté</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 86</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 70</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 56</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 76</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 40</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 65</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Karim Konaté is another right-footed footballer from Ivory Coast who can reach great heights in the coming years. His pace is already stellar at 86 and can potentially reach a rating of 87, which could make him a well-rounded forward for your Career Mode.</p>



<p>Semih Kılıçsoy, Karim Konaté, and Paris Brunner are three great striker options if your club has a lower transfer budget.</p>



<h2 id="h-mathys-tel">Mathys Tel</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 86</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 80</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 77</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 29</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Mathys Tel is another young French talent currently playing for Bayern Munich. His insane stats at just 19 years old make him one of the top contenders for Career Mode in EA Sports FC 25.</p>



<p>An 86 Pace and 80 Shooting should be enough for him to be an impactful substitute to outrun the defenders and get away with last-minute goals for your club.</p>



<h2 id="h-benjamin-sesko">Benjamin Šeško</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 85</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 63</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 77</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 46</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 88</li>
</ul>



<p>Benjamin Šeško is a 21-year-old Slovenian forward currently playing for RB Leipzig. His stats are as good as Mathys Tel’s but with a better heading accuracy. This could make him a perfect substitute during late matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-vitor-roque">Vitor Roque</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 85</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 79</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 59</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 80</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 20</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 87</li>
</ul>



<p>Vitor Hugo Roque Ferreira is currently aged 19 and playing for Real Betis on loan from Barcelona. His stats are great – 85 Pace and 79 Shooting means he can be a super sub for your team during the initial years and a star in the future.</p>



<p>Unlike Endrick, his transfer budget is not that high but could end up being one of the best forwards down the line.</p>



<h2 id="h-endrick">Endrick</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pace</strong>: 89</li>



<li><strong>Shooting</strong>: 76</li>



<li><strong>Passing</strong>: 61</li>



<li><strong>Dribbling</strong>: 78</li>



<li><strong>Defending</strong>: 30</li>



<li><strong>Physical</strong>: 64</li>



<li><strong>Skill</strong>: 4 Star</li>



<li><strong>Weak Foot</strong>: 3 Star</li>



<li><strong>Potential</strong>: 91</li>

<p>Endrick is surely an upcoming star and is currently playing for Real Madrid. This Brazilian forward is 18 years old at the time of writing and is already competing at the highest level in La Liga.</p>



<p>Endrick already has 89 Pace at such a young age and he will only get better with age. His transfer budget is higher than all other players on this list as he can reach a potential rating of 91 down the line, but it could be well worth the investment for your club’s future in Career Mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-issues-response-to-rumors-regarding-tencents-potential-buyout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has officially <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/zAyDQducoGatn4IydphOy/dcdb9b3c9f3ce53112b358890acd1196/PR_Company_statement_07102024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to come forward</a> and address the rumors of Tencent exploring the option to buy out the French game publisher, although the statement right now is very vague. It's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/">rumored that Tencent is teaming up with the Guillemot Family</a> to buy out Ubisoft to take the company private, but it has not officially been confirmed. According to sources close to the scene, Tencent and the Guillemot Family are speaking to advisors. In a statement released on Monday, Ubisoft said that they "regularly reviews all its strategic options in the interest of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-small-investor-pushes-hard-for-the-companys-sale/">stakeholders</a> and will inform the market if and when appropriate."</p>
<p>Additionally, the statement goes on to mention that "the Company reiterates that management is currently focused on executing its strategy, centered on two core verticals - Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences." This is as far as the statement goes, with the statement being just a couple of sentences long.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be too shocking for the Guillemot Family to team up with Tencent to purchase Ubisoft, as the Guillemot Family founded Ubisoft, with Yves Guillemot being the current CEO of the company. It's said that Tencent wants to look into ways to "stabilize Ubisoft and bolster its value." At the moment, Ubisoft isn't having the best time, as its shares were driven down 19% last month, especially with Ubisoft making the decision to delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Star Wars Outlaws sales being much lower than they initially thought.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws has been a huge point of contention for both Ubisoft and the audience, with Ubisoft funneling as much money as possible into the game and its promotion, for it to only sell a million copies in the month of its release.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Ubisoft is considering taking the company private. Tencent has a 10% stake in Ubisoft, but also owns 49.9% of Guillemot Brothers Ltd. If Tencent did take the company private, it's a move that wouldn't surprise many in the slightest. However, if they were to take the company private, there would also be a push for huge reconstructions, including a new CEO and many new layoffs. Ubisoft has already laid off quite a few workers from their team, with the IT team and special effects studio being at the forefront of the layoffs.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has now been delayed until next year, so it remains to be seen if Ubisoft will make any decisions before that point or if they are waiting to see whether this game will fix their finances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Google’s Android app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">is an illegal monopoly</a> — and now it will have to change. </p></div><p>Today, Judge James Donato issued his final ruling <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates">in <em>Epic v. Google</em></a>, ordering Google to effectively open up the Google Play app store to competition for three whole years. Google will have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em> within </em>Google Play, and it must give rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, unless developers opt out individually. </p><p>These were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">Epic’s biggest asks</a>, and they might change the Android app marketplace forever — if they aren’t immediately paused or blocked on appeal. </p><p>And they’re not all that Epic has won today.</p><p>Starting November 1st, 2024, and ending November 1st, 2027, Google must also:</p><div><ul><li>Stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps distributed on the Google Play Store (the jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store)</li><li>Let Android developers tell users about other ways to pay from within the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers link to ways to download their apps outside of the Play Store</li><li>Let Android developers set their own prices for apps irrespective of Play Billing</li></ul></div><p>Google also can’t: </p><div><ul><li>Share app revenue “with any person or entity that distributes Android apps” or plans to launch an app store or app platform</li><li>Offer developers money or perks to launch their apps on the Play Store exclusively or first</li><li>Offer developers money or perks <strong>not</strong> to launch their apps on rival stores</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks to preinstall the Play Store</li><li>Offer device makers or carriers money or perks <strong>not </strong>to preinstall rival stores</li></ul></div><p>In <em>Epic v. Google</em>,<em> </em>Epic successfully argued that Google had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">created such a substantial array of deals with developers, carriers, and device makers</a> that it was nigh-impossible for rival stores to spring up. By blocking those sorts of deals, and proactively helping rival app stores, it’s possible some real competition to Google’s monopoly could now arrive.</p><p>Google will still have some control over safety and security as it opens up the Google Play Store to rival stores. The injunction says that Google can “take reasonable measures” that are “strictly necessary and narrowly tailored” and are “comparable” to how it currently polices the Google Play Store. Google will be able to charge a fee for that policing, too. Epic has repeatedly argued that Google should not be able to deter third-party app stores through policing, so it’s likely Epic and Google will keep butting heads over this.</p><p>Judge Donato is giving Google eight months from now to come up with a system, with a three-person technical committee jointly chosen by Epic and Google reviewing any disputes. That system will also come with a way for developers to opt out of being listed in rival Android app stores.</p><p>Epic didn’t quite get everything it asked for: it wanted the judge to crack open Google Play for six years, not three; allow users to sideload apps with a single tap; and for Google to stop being able to tie Android APIs to Google Play. </p><p>Why not six years? “The provisions are designed to level the playing field for the entry and growth of rivals, without burdening Google excessively,” writes Donato in his order. “As competition comes into play and the network effects that Google Play unfairly enjoys are abated, Google should not be unduly constrained as a competitor.”</p><p>Yet Amazon, of all companies, convinced Judge Donato that Google’s rivals need a helping hand. “Even a corporate behemoth like Amazon could not compete with the Google Play Store due to network effects,” writes Donato, citing a key piece of evidence from the trial: an internal Google presentation that suggested Amazon would struggle with the chicken-and-egg problem of attracting both users and apps. To date, the Amazon Appstore has not become a substantial competitor.</p><p>But with access to the Google Play catalog of apps, Donato argues, rival app stores will now have “a fighting chance of getting off the ground”.</p><p>Today, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">Google says</a> the changes will cause “a range of unintended consequences that will harm American consumers, developers and device makers.” It will appeal.</p><p>Meanwhile, Epic is calling it a victory:</p><p>“The Epic Games Store and other app stores are coming to the Google Play Store in 2025 in the USA — without Google’s scare screens and Google’s 30% app tax — thanks to victory in Epic v Google,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1843394692551192972">says in a post on X</a>.</p><p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">originally sued Google</a> on August 13th, 2020 — the very same day it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">sued Apple, too</a>. The game developer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments">sprung a premeditated trap</a> on both tech giants by attempting to bypass their 30 percent fee on in-app purchases with a surprise update to its mega-popular game <em>Fortnite. </em>Both tech companies retaliated by kicking <em>Fortnite</em> off their app stores, only to be met by a coordinated #FreeFortnite action campaign and a pair of lawsuits accusing each of creating illegal monopolies.</p><p>The Apple case is already over, and Apple mostly won: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">Supreme Court rejected Epic’s final appeal</a> this January. The only thing Epic legally achieved there was an order dismantling Apple’s “anti-steering rules,” theoretically letting developers freely tell their customers how to bypass Apple’s payment systems. (I won’t discuss the Apple case more than this brief outline since I’m&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister/archives/38#:~:text=Ethics%20statement%2C%20June%202023%3A">ethically bound</a>.)</p><p>But the Google case took far longer to kick off, and it went very differently. I spent 15 days reporting live from the courtroom, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">I saw Epic show time and again</a> that Google was running scared, didn’t treat developers equally, and had something to hide. </p><p>The jury in <em>Epic v. Google</em> was thoroughly convinced: last December, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">it reached the unanimous verdict</a> that the Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service were an illegal monopoly and that many of the special deals it made with game developers and phone manufacturers were anticompetitive behavior.</p><div><p>“We’re going to tear the barriers down”</p></div><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing">Judge Donato warned</a> that Google would pay for its behavior. “We’re going to tear the barriers down, it’s just the way it’s going to happen,” he said. In remedy hearings, he rejected Google’s suggestions that meeting Epic’s demands would take too much work, cost too much money, or were impossible to arrange without taking substantial time.</p><p>It’s not yet clear whether Google will have to immediately follow the court’s demands, even though the permanent injunction will take effect November 1st. Google already promised to appeal the verdict, and it’s now apparently looking for an immediate stay — Google says it will ask to “<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">pause Epic’s requested changes” in this new blog post today</a>. </p><p>Like Apple, Google now hopes the appeals court will press pause on Judge Donato’s order while it tries its luck again. Apple spent years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">delaying the anti-steering rules change</a> with its legal appeals.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">Epic filed a second lawsuit against Google (and Samsung)</a> one week ago, arguing the companies were already attempting to sidestep this upcoming injunction by adding additional friction for third-party app stores. Since that case is now officially related to this one, Judge Donato will be hearing it as well.</p><p>You can read the full order and permanent injunction embedded below:</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 7th: </strong>Added Sweeney’s post.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
