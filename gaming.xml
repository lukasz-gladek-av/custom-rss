<p>If you’re an avid Escape From Tarkov fan, then this question starts to lurk around inside your head once every so often: ‘When is the next Tarkov wipe?’ It’s a monumental event – that game-wide refresh that rests everyone back to level pegging in an instant, and it often brings white-hot content updates pouring into the game.</p>



<p>When is the next Escape From Tarkov wipe, and what is it going to look like?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-wipe-in-tarkov">What Is a Wipe In Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When Escape From Tarkov ‘wipes’, every player is reset to level one, and their entire ‘stash’ – which is their collection weapons, equipment, money, and so on – is completely pushed back to the state it was when they first purchased the game. From there, players must once again climb the ladder, build their empire, complete early-game tasks, and rebuild their in-game hideout.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player/">Is Escape From Tarkov Single-Player?</a></h6>



<p>It’s a balancing mechanic, as it ensures that all players will at one point be matched in terms of equipment and opportunities. It also ensures that the game is kept somewhat fresh, as there is a point when the most experienced Escape From Tarkov players will simply have nothing left to do in the game but play it. </p>



<p>When a wipe hits, it typically brings with it a major update. These updates change the face of the game, often introducing entirely new maps, modes, characters, weapons – even new movement mechanics and physics elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-does-tarkov-pve-wipe">Does Tarkov PvE Wipe?</h3>



<p>In 2024, Battlestate Games opened up Tarkov’s PvE offering much more universally, giving players worldwide the ability to take advantage of this ‘offline’ platform. It works differently compared to the ‘traditional’ game as it doesn’t wipe automatically. Players can trigger a manual wipe whenever they’d like, but otherwise, they’re free to keep playing on the same character for as long as they like.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-tarkov-wipe">When Is The Next Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It has been confirmed that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will take place in August 2024. It’s expected that it’ll arrive in the third week of the month, starting from the 19th. It’ll be accompanied by an ambitious Twitch Drops campaign as usual.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-tell-when-tarkov-is-going-to-wipe">How To Tell When Tarkov Is Going To Wipe</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Battlestate Games, the developer of Escape From Tarkov, will start scheduling special events just before a wipe is due to hit. In the past, Escape From Tarkov’s wipe events have been:</p>



<ul>
<li>Maximum-value loot spawning in very specific locations on the map</li>



<li>All the game’s bosses spawn on the same map</li>



<li>Players spawning in poisoned and need to find a cure</li>



<li>Players spawning in with a ‘stim’ injector that could give them ‘super soldier abilities’</li>



<li>In-game traders offering their wares for just a few coins</li>



<li>Multiple loot airdrops falling in all at once</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Tarkov events start ramping up, then you know that the next Escape From Tarkov wipe is starting soon. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-won%E2%80%99t-let-you-take-erotic-photos.950133/</guid>

<p>Fans of Dead Rising, the 2006 zombie apocalypse-fuelled title, are dismayed that they’ll no longer earn points in-game for snapping ‘erotic’ photos. Well, perhaps ‘dismayed’ is a little strong, but some tongue-in-cheek comments are being made about the ‘too PC’ removal of ‘Erotica’ points in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p>In a recent developer diary, covered first by Famitsu, Capcom revealed the decision to strip points for erotic photos clean out of the upcoming game, which is set to be released on September 19.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-it-clean">Keep It Clean</h2>



<p>Admittedly, it was a <strong>little </strong>creepy in 2006. Let’s say you managed to snap a picture of a female zombie laying on their back, taking advantage of an angle that let you peek up their dress. This would earn you ‘erotica’ points, boosting the value of your photos. Everything from cleavage to suggestive elements earned you these points, but that won’t be the case going into the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Capcom has confirmed</a> that while photography remains a front-and-centre element of the game, getting points for lewd angles is no longer a thing.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It has been boosted with several quality-of-life improvements, such as auto-saving, and most of the game’s environment – which is set in and around a shopping mall – has been fully refreshed.</p>



<p>Are you excited about heading back to Willamette in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?</p>

Starfruit seeds are only profitable if bought from the Oasis shop or made from a seed maker and red cabbage isn't available at Pierre's until Year 2.

If you want to spread out your income a bit better, it's good to mix in a few crops with shorter turnaround times. Corn is also a great crop to plant. While it isn't as profitable for each harvest, corn continues to produce and it's a hybrid crop, able to grow during Summer and Fall.

            <p>Team Folon – the volunteer squad of developers who have released the ambitious <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod, Fallout London – is set to launch itself as a new indie studio.</p>
<p>Talking to the BBC (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-london/developer-new-indie-studio">PCGN</a>), Folon's project lead, Dean Carter, admitted that "as much as I love the fact that this is a free project - that we can offer this thing for free for all the community - free doesn't pay our bills".</p>
<p>"What has been great for us is that a lot of people who have really enjoyed [Fallout London] have donated to us, and we're channelling that into Team Folon, which is what we're going to be moving into," Carter said.</p>

<p>"We should hopefully launch our own indie games company which will allow us to come up with our own ideas, create our own games, and work [...] without having to speak to anyone above us, such as Bethesda, or anything like that.</p>
<p>"It'll be completely our own thing and we can create a game that we want, that we think the community will enjoy. Fallout London has been a great springboard for that."</p>
<p>As for what's next for Fallout London?</p>
<p>"Fallout London will continue until we have all the content which we had to cut for the release. We have another ending, which we call the wild card ending - that will come out in one of the future patches. That's not going to happen soon; we can see ourselves working until the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We don't have ulterior motives. We wanted to do something that was fun [during lockdown], we've made something that's fun, and people have found it fun, so for us we've achieved that goal so we're very happy about it, and the reception."</p>
<p>Asked if Bethesda had reached out to Team Folon following all the positive coverage of Fallout London, Carter simply said: "Um, no. No, we haven't."</p>
<p>"There hasn't been any communication, which is strange, because we've now had communication with other people in the industry, and what I guess would be seen as their competitors. <em>They've</em> reached out to us, and we've spoken to them, but Bethesda themselves have not spoken to us at all, no."</p>
<p>He did, however, add that as this was a fan-made mod created entirely on Bethesda's own IP, Team Folon in no way believes it is "entitled" to an audience with Bethesda.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-hotfix-still-on-the-way-along-with-huge-update">A hotfix for Fallout: London to address crashing issues is still on the way</a>, with developer Team Folon planning a "huge" patch soon after.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">game-size fan-made mod for Fallout 4 set in the English capital</a> released at the end of July, but players have experienced a high number of crashes and issues, including Eurogamer's Ian Higton when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">streamed his playthrough</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon has since promised a fix was on the way</a> and, in a new statement on its Discord, has reiterated its plans for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick said the company is not tempted to put its game on subscription services like Xbox Game Pass on day one because "our decisions are rational".</p>
<p>Talking to our sister site <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Zelnick said that whilst he accepted "offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day and date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time", "it won't affect [Take-Two's] decisions [not to offer AAA games on subscription services on day one]".</p>

<p>With "15 immersive core" games on Take-Two's books for 2026 and 2027 - one of which is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, of course - as well as one indie, five mobile games, and three remasters, Zelnick says it's his company's "job to outperform the industry, and the one way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>"There are modest tailwinds which are positive," he concludes. "It is our job to outperform the industry, and the only way to do that is to generate big hits, and I think we have all the necessary elements to deliver that."</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that Zelnick asked if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">fans could please give the new Borderlands movie "a chance"</a> because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during its Q1 earnings call, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick told investors that its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
