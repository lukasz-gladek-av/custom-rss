            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-release-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dbrand-launches-%E2%80%98darkplates-2-0%E2%80%99-for-ps5-and-says-%E2%80%98checkmate-lawyers%E2%80%99.1012413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-release-ps5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2021, Sony shut down the production of dbrand’s ‘Darkplates’, bespoke side plates to replace the stock covering provided with the PlayStation 5. They were sleek, they were edgy, and they proved to be too much for Sony to handle, and the tech titan served up a lawsuit on a silver platter.</p>



<p>Now, three years later, dbrand is back with Darkplates 2.0, a second stab that’s a prolific punch in the gut to Sony’s lawyers. There are now more than 100,000 users sitting in a queue to pick up the PS5 Darkplates – and the first wave of them is available <strong>today</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dark-innovations">Dark Innovations</h2>



<p>The Darkplates 2.0 are available for the original PlayStation 5 <strong>and </strong>the Slim models, spanning both the digital and disc editions of the console. Dbrand has made sure to produce something both functional and stunning, creating a black-on-black design with increased airflow, fewer parts, and better materials.</p>



<p>Alongside the Darkplates 2.0 innovation sits the Lightstrips, a series of custom LED strips that slip between the PS5’s core body and the Darkplates 2.0, offering a brighter, bolder alternative to the stock lighting solution.</p>



<p>In a par-for-the-course style of spiel, dbrand held nothing back while marketing the Darkplates 2.0 case:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Imagine this: you’re a ¥15,000,000,000,000 enterprise who just spent a small fortune designing their next-generation gaming console. A privately held corporation run by robots makes it black. The world rejoices. You’re livid. You vent your frustrations to a team of lawyers. They get to work. Now, under threat of litigation, those robots have to redesign their Darkplates… while also funding a legal defense. Needless to say, some corners were cut. You’re welcome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team event went above and beyond to revolutionise the packaging of the Darkplates 2.0 case. Per a comment on the dbrand website, the crew ‘sent (their) Box Scientists to Mars.’ If you’re like me and you’re a bit of a packaging nerd, that’s sure to excite you.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The release of Darkplates 2.0 will be staggered across four waves, the first of which is preparing to ship now. Follow-up waves will run from November to January, so get your hands on them while you can.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though.</p>



<p>Dbrand also took the flimsy plastic pegs that are used to stand up a PS5 console and pieced together an all-new stand. It’s a magnetic base unit that’s super sturdy and robust, giving you better peace of mind when laying your console horizontally. In dbrand’s words, it’s a step up from ‘a pair of plastic peglegs that could be snapped in half by a toddler.’</p>



<p>If you jump onto the dbrand site, you can <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/ps5#options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">order your Darkplates 2.0</a>, bolt on a lush middle skin and some Lightstrips, and if you want, throw on a stand. The whole bundle should run you less than $100.</p>



<p>Are you going to snap up a set of Darkplates 2.0? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>Today, 2K announced Project ETHOS, a new third-person hero shooter in development at 31st Union, Michael Condrey's studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/31st-union-michael-condrey-2k-ambitious-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> four years ago in the Silicon Valley area.</p>
<p>Project ETHOS will be a free-to-play game, and it will integrate roguelike elements. Players will be able to shape their play style each match through Evolutions, powerful, semi-randomized upgrades that are unique to each Hero. With Evolutions, it is possible to transform a sniper into a melee skirmisher or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. The roguelike elements mean that in each run, players take on the competition with new abilities, stakes and challenges that change each match. There's a risk-versus-reward element where they can play it safe with their hard-earned cores, or go for broke, risk it all and see if they can take the top spot.&nbsp;The game will include an Extraction mode called Trials, which was described as&nbsp;an ongoing, persistent battle to collect cores, extract, and unlock powerful augments to fuel future Trials runs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K and developer 31st Union are throwing their hats into the trendy game ring with&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, a roguelike hero shooter with an emphasis on co-operative gameplay.</p>
<p>There isn't much information available about the game right now; its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139090/Project_ETHOS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam page</a> describes it as a "free-to-play third-person roguelike hero shooter" that's currently in development, and there's not much more info besides that.</p>
<p>However, a few screenshots have been released alongside said Steam page, and they show a game that looks an awful lot like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, all smoothed-over character designs and pseudo-cartoony visuals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter-powerups.jpg?itok=U6OdfsiR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/project-ethos-2k-roguelike-hero-shooter-powerups.jpg?itok=58rp2InM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Decisions, decisions.</figcaption></figure><p>According to an early <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN preview</a>,&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>is also an extraction shooter, with its main gameplay mode apparently taking after the likes of&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare&nbsp;</em>to some degree.</p>
<p>Given how early the game is in development, it's not entirely encouraging that IGN's previewer ends their time with the game by saying that it "fails at being a new experience that players will crave...over and over again".</p>
<p>Other gameplay modes in&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>are described as "cookie-cutter and unexciting", and honestly, the character designs in the game are already giving me&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>vibes, which, given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">the fate of that game</a>, probably isn't what 2K wants to hear.</p>
<p>I don't want to be pessimistic about&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>before it's even seen the light of day (and, of course, before I've even played it), but what 2K and 31st Union have released so far makes me question whether the gaming industry really needs another game like this right now.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://ethos.2k.com/playtest/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up for the playtest here</a>, but the catch is that you'll need to watch at least 30 minutes of a Twitch "partner creator" playing the game in order to secure a drop that contains the key.</p>
<p>On the signup page, you'll also find an outline of what kind of PC specs you'll need to play&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos</em>, as well as which countries can take part and more. Happy hunting!</p>

            <p>Bohemia Interactive have announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-4">Arma 4</a>, the next big instalment in their shooter simulation series, will release in 2027. The announcement came at the tail-end of Bohemia's 25th Anniversary Concert, alongside some disturbingly gun-less footage of a coastal promontory with rippling ocean waters against a cloudy sky - it reminds me more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced">The Elder Scrolls 6's announcement teaser</a> than any tactical mili-banger. Perhaps they're secretly making an open world walking simulator? I kid, I kid. Please put the chair down.</p><!--more-->

</span></p><p>Bohemia <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arma-reforger-bohemias-bridge-towards-arma-4-has-left-early-access">unveiled Arma 4 back in 2022</a>, telling CJ (RPS in peace) that the intervening Arma Reforger would serve as a kind of bridge or testing ground: it has allowed Arma modders to experiment with the developer's Enfusion engine, and equipped Arma 4 developers with player data and feedback. Reforger <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arma-reforger-bohemias-bridge-towards-arma-4-has-left-early-access">left early access in November 2023</a>, with the final update adding such features as a totally revised supply system and something approximating fast travel.</p>
<p>If you're new to Arma, it's one of the most realism-driven simulations on the shop - so much so that the US Army has used Arma games for training, and Bohemia developers were famously once arrested by Greek police for taking research photos of military installations. Bohemia even had their own division dedicated to making testing simulations for a while - eventually named Bohemia Interactive Simulations, this was sold off in 2013 and has become a standalone business entity that uses the same engine technology. Bohemia's love of realism has also seen nefarious parties attempt to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bohemia-warns-against-spread-of-fake-israelipalestinian-conflict-videos-actually-created-in-arma-3">pass off footage of Arma games as real-life war photography</a>.</p><p>Hi-fi battlefield recreations aside, Bohemia are also the developers of the legendary DayZ, an enormous Arma mod taking the form of an open world zombie survival experience, which entered early access in 2013. I've never had huge interest in Arma, but DayZ's obsessively in-depth injury systems have given rise to some of my favourite video game travel writing, like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/the-healing-touch-dr-wasteland-brings-hope-to-day-zs-grim-world/">the tale of Dr Wasteland</a>. Perhaps I'll try to get into Arma: Reforger properly in the run-up to Arma 4. It's not like there's any rush.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, it turned out to be a fantastic update  that both respects the original game while making (mostly) smart changes to modernize it. And it appears at least 999,999 other people agree with me. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1846708547591287204&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1846708547591287204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 16, Konami tweeted</a></span> that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake had sold over 1 million copies. According to the tweet, this data is from October 11, which was only five days after<em> Silent Hill 2 </em>went on sale via early access pre-orders. It’s also only three days after it launched for everyone else on October 8. In other words, it didn’t take long for this new horror remake to hit the million copies sold milestone. </p><p>In fact, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1846708623667253349?s=46&amp;t=80LNbBiDTZPtWlgvEeWiDQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1846708623667253349?s=46&amp;t=80LNbBiDTZPtWlgvEeWiDQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Daniel Ahmad</a></span>, director of research &amp; insights at Niko Partners, this is much, much faster than the original<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> That 2001 PS2 game took a month to reach a million.

                <p dir="ltr">2K Games has unveiled its first-ever free-to-play live-service shooter, Project Ethos, via an announcement trailer and a community playtest that anyone can take part in.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by 31st Union, 2K describes Project Ethos as a "third-person roguelike hero shooter" with a focus on randomized upgrades (called Evolutions) that allow players to tailor each hero to their specific playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">"Shape your playstyle every match through Evolutions: powerful, semi-randomized, upgrades unique to each hero," 2K shared in a press release announcing the game. "Evolve a sniper into a close-range skirmisher, or a support role into a powerful lone wolf. Build your hero in real-time to suit your personal playstyle."</p><p dir="ltr">The community playtest provides access to two modes: Trials and Gauntlet. Trials--described by 2K as the game's "signature mode"--sees squads of up to three players teaming up to take down the competition while collecting cores. Cores are a resource that can be exchanged for Augments, which--as the name suggests--fuel players' future Trials runs. Squads can head to the extraction point at any time during the match, but early extractions mean fewer cores, so the ultimate goal is to stay alive as long as possible and maximize the amount of cores collected prior to extraction. Players who have been downed can be picked up by teammates, and those who have been killed can be respawned at Respawn Beacons (as long as at least one squad member is still alive, of course).</p><p dir="ltr">Gauntlet mode is a more intense experience, described by 2K as a "competitive head-to-head tournament mode" in which squads face off against enemy teams of a similar skill level. Heroes can be upgraded between each match, and the ultimate goal is to be the last squad standing. Players who bite the dust in this mode cannot be respawned, but will automatically respawn at the beginning of the next match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4386076-pethumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4386076-pethumb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386076"></a><figcaption>Each of the game's heroes have two unique weapons and two unique abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4386076-pethumb.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">According to 2K and 31st Union, "The best way to learn about Project Ethos is to play it."

Should we all still be here in 2027, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arma-4">Arma 4</a> is set to launch then. 
</p>
<p>
Bohemia Interactive announced the vague and far-off 2027 release window for Arma 4 today, during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cC-uT5rc9HQ">25th anniversary concert for the studio</a> that featured music from its games. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first we've heard of Arma 4, the inevitable next entry in Bohemia's hugely-popular military shooter series. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bohemia-interactive-teases-arma-4-launches-cold-war-military-shooter-arma-reforger">studio debuted the standalone Arma Forger</a>, a new platform for the series with an open-world sandbox, integrated modding tools and more. 
</p>
<p>
At the time, Bohemia said Reforger was the "first milestone on the long road to Arma 4".

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arma-3">Arma 3</a>, meanwhile, is now over a decade old. It originally launched on PC back in 2013. In the years since, it has continually been kept updated with new expansions. Arma 3 has also repeatedly made news headlines, as its realistic war footage has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/russian-tv-station-mistakenly-airs-footage-of-arma-3-during-report-on-war-in-syria">accidentally</a> - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disheartening-to-see-arma-3-gameplay-footage-used-to-spread-fake-israel-palestine-news-developer-says">purposefully</a> - used to spread fake footage of real-world conflicts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bohemia-asks-fans-to-stop-sharing-fake-news-war-footage-made-in-arma-3">much to Bohemia's chagrin</a>.
</p>
<p>
By our reckoning, Arma 4 is the first game to be publicly given a 2027 launch window. I wonder what video game hardware we'll all be using then?

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846588233573937193" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter) yesterday</a>, Hazelight announced that&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>sales have reached the 20 million mark, which rather impressively means that the game has managed to shift another 10 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/it-takes-two-sales-stride-across-10-million-barrier">since February last year</a>.</p>
<p>If you were one of the millions who bought&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and you enjoyed it, then you'll be pleased to know that Fares and his studio are currently working on a brand new IP, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/it-takes-two-sales-hazelight-new-ip-book.jpg?itok=VsNQDctF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/it-takes-two-sales-hazelight-new-ip-book.jpg?itok=pIqYkSAb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How has&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>achieved 20 million sales?

<p>He goes on to say that it's a brand new IP, the title of which will be "S*** ******n", which admittedly doesn't tell us much. Finally, he says that he "can't wait to show it soon". Could a Game Awards reveal be on the cards?</p>
<p>All we know about the new IP is that censored title and the fact that it will be released <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1846929745016987890" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sometime in the 2020s</a>, which...well, it's a release window of sorts, eh?</p>
<p>As you can imagine, some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/josef-fares-and-hazelight-studios-next-game-is-confirmed-to-be-a-brand-new-ip-called-s-n.1012218/post-130295943" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people</a> are already <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1846929953633214554" rel="noopener" target="_blank">starting</a> to have fun <a href="https://x.com/SirJackSnake/status/1846933255498399990" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speculating</a> what the full name of Fares and Hazelight's new IP might be.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24268007/modders-ai-companions-stardew-valley-skyrim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Stardew Valley,</em> you can usually only speak to characters a few times per day. This limitation has led to a number of mods that add things for them to say so that players can spend more time with their virtual pals. But like many games, Stardew recently turned to AI, resulting in the addition of a mod with the ability to have theoretically endless conversations with your favorite farm companion.</p><p>“The reception has been a lot better than I initially thought [it would be],” says modder DualityOfSoul. In the comments on Nexus Mods, users have called it “brilliant” and “one of the best mods out this year.”</p><p>To function, the mod plugs into OpenAI’s API. The implementation is impressive but limited in its own way. Every character takes on a similar jovial personality that I’ve come to associate with the built-in parameters of these large language models. Grumpy camper Linus first tells me bluntly to leave him alone; this is his prewritten dialogue since he hasn’t warmed up to me yet. But click again, and I get the OpenAI dialogue — three long text boxes run one after the other. He calls me his friend and says he hopes I’ve “been finding peace in the beauty of nature.” Next, Pam complains that “every day is the same routine” before changing her tune to say she hopes “you’re enjoying the season as much as I am.”</p><p>The responses are somewhat tailored to the characters, and it works better when I’m not talking to grouchy NPCs. But the mod can’t easily escape that underlying voice. <em>Stardew</em> is a largely cheery game, especially after you’ve befriended everyone, so I can see how it can fit into the vibe for some players. But it’s a noticeable limitation.</p><div><figcaption><em>Stardew Valley.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ConcernedApe</cite></p></div><p>That limitation is less present in Herika, an AI companion mod for <em>Skyrim</em>. Herika acts like most <em>Skyrim </em>companions, following the player and helping out in combat and elsewhere. But she <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DztAhbJT5Diw">will also respond to conversation</a>, both written and spoken. The LLM can draw from an understanding of the game’s map, quests, and key features and be assigned a personality. This means that she can be prompted to use a different style from the standard LLM voice, at least to a point.</p><p>Reece Meakings joined the Herika project after seeing the first iteration created by his now-coworker who goes by Tylermaister. The pair have expanded the mod from a tool to summarize the many books of <em>Skyrim</em> into a fully-fledged follower and intend to expand it again into a framework for any NPC to become an AI companion.</p><p>Nonetheless, Meakings doesn’t think that AI is ready to be used in game development more broadly. “It’s not going to work right now,” he says. For starters, using Herika or AI Stardew costs money. Both use OpenAI’s API, which charges the user a fraction of a cent per generated dialogue line. From the comments on Nexus, that low-level cost has put off a lot of players who are used to mods being entirely free. (Herika does offer a free option, but this requires running the LLM on your own setup, which is resource-intensive.) On a larger scale, any company will have to deal with the price of connecting to an API or running their own servers, multiplied across every player.</p><p>Then there’s the open-ended nature of how people interact with LLMs. “That completely changes how you [would] have to design the game,” says Meakings. Developers would lose linear control of dialogue trees and script triggers, quickly opening up possibilities that they didn’t account for in the narrative or worldbuilding. LLMs might be able to help NPCs keep up, but the rest of the game’s scripting wouldn’t have any way of adapting. Plus, he says, despite the safeguards companies attempt to use, it’s “very easy, if you know what you’re doing” to make these LLMs say things that are NSFW, potentially causing PR problems for companies that modders don’t have to consider.</p><p>At the moment, these larger-scale problems mean Meakings sees the most potential for AI in NPCs like Herika, particularly in the mod space. There are also AI NPC mods for games like <em>Hogwarts Legacy,</em> <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and <em>Garry’s Mod</em>. <em>Mantella</em>, another <em>Skyrim</em> mod that gives LLM interactions to every <em>Skyrim</em> NPC, has 30,000 unique downloads. (Herika has 25,000.) All of them have positive feedback — limitations aside, people are enjoying playing with AI-generated content.</p><p>Meakings’ own interactions with Herika give an indication as to why. In his experience, “you’ll really end up having meaningful conversations with something which isn’t human.” Although he understands that Herika is just a program, he’s clearly engaged by the fact that he’s been able to interact with her on a different level than previous characters. You don’t need to make small talk with Herika or stick to “ritualistic” social niceties. You can jump right to debating the philosophy and theology of <em>Skyrim</em>. In fact, you might need to because she can judge your actions.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bethesda Softworks</cite></p></div><p>He gives a specific example. Playing as an Argonian, Meakings heard a rude comment about the lizard-like race from a standard NPC. “I [said,] ‘Hey, Herika, can you kill him? Please? He’s being racist to me.’” Herika refused, apparently either because of her own morality or because they were in a place with guards watching, which could have landed them in jail. Then, she started wandering away, talking about visiting the catacombs under the settlement.</p><p>At first, Meakings thought it was a bug. “But then I realized, ‘oh, I know what she did.’ …She realized, ‘oh, Reece is very angry. We can’t kill this person because we’re in the middle of a city — you can’t just kill people. I need to get him out of the situation… what if I lure him to his catacomb for treasures where we can get some space away from the situation?’” She seemed to be trying to diffuse things based on the tools available to her.</p><p>This kind of experience is not unique to this form of AI. Procedurally generated content creating emergent narratives through a combination of interesting behavior and player-led meaning-making is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball">well documented</a>. But AI mods may open up more possibilities for these kinds of moments.</p><p>For that to happen, though, the LLMs need material to work with. Meakings is clear that Herika would not function without the wider framework of <em>Skyrim </em>since much of how she communicates relies on the writing of the original team. In a scenario in which LLMs are used as NPCs in a produced video game, they still could not exist without writers.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">video game performers strike</a> raises crucial questions about how these technologies will deal with digital replications of voice actors, something Nexus Mods treads carefully around. AI mods are allowed, but affected creators, including voice actors, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/14850">can ask for them to be removed</a> if they feel the “work is damaging to them.” (Herika has multiple options for generating her voice.)</p><p>The rollout of AI on the web has been fast and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza">messy</a>, and how it might go in the game industry is still an open question. But thanks to modders, tens of thousands of players are already experimenting with it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She’s angrily firing her signature green-and-pink shotgun up at Adam Smasher, the sadistic, foul-mouthed cyborg who permeates the <em>Cyberpunk</em> mythos and famously serves as the final boss of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The statue depicts the bastard barrelling toward her from on high, and anyone who’s watched <em>Edgerunners</em> knows he is about to put the “smash” in Smasher and crush her in front of all of Night City. And now you, too, can relive this tragic moment for $300, plus shipping and handling.<br></p><p>The 14-inch-tall statue is set to ship out between May and July of next year, and even if it’s a kind of bizarre moment to capture in a collectible, it looks pretty damn good. Both Rebecca and Smasher are highly detailed, and there are a lot of small touches—like the bullet casings at her feet—that help tell a story in one moment, frozen in time. Thankfully, it doesn’t reveal the devastating ending, so any visitors to your home don’t need to know that you’re proudly displaying the moment before a disaster.

                <p>Steel oneself for a new challenge in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's Operation mode with the arrival of Lethal difficulty. It's one of the biggest additions to the game as part of patch 4.0.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not all, either. The update--available now--introduces a new Operation named Termination as well as a photo mode. Termination takes place on Kaduku, and Space Marine 2 players can test out the Lethal difficulty there.

With games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Honor of Kings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> earning billions of dollars during their life cycle, mobile games clearly have ample opportunity to bring in revenue post-download from in-app purchases and ads. However, with hundreds of thousands of mobile games on the market, entering this arena can be daunting. How do you create a mobile game marketing strategy to make your game stand out from the crowd? In this article, we explore several ways of achieving this.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Crafting a winning mobile marketing plan">Crafting a winning mobile marketing plan</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Setting Clear and Measurable Objectives">Setting Clear and Measurable Objectives</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first action in your mobile game marketing strategy should be to set out your goals. Without clear and measurable objectives, you will struggle to quantify your success or pivot if your strategy does not yield results. Start by thinking about what your priorities are: what are you trying to achieve with your campaign (increasing your number of users or increasing your revenue per user?), who is your target market, where are you most likely to encounter these people (TikTok or Instagram, Facebook or Baidu?) and which KPIs will you need to use to measure your success (ad campaign conversion rate, click-through rate, average revenue per user, daily active users, or number of downloads)? Your marketing strategy will likely change over time as your KPIs help you keep track of what is and isn’t working.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding mobile player demographics">Understanding mobile player demographics</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the key considerations in your mobile game marketing strategy will be who you are marketing to. You can’t please all of the people all of the time, so you will need to determine what sort of person belongs to your target market. Who is playing similar games already on the market? Where are they located, how much disposable income do they have per year, and what are their age ranges? Research your competitors to find out who’s playing their games, what they’re doing well and any areas for improvement that you could use in your own campaigns. Use tools such as Google Trends to help you identify key trends and conversations in your game’s genre. Carry out user surveys to discover your target market’s interests, habits and preferences so you can tailor your mobile game marketing specifically to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via Pexels and LinkedIn</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure your decisions are data-led—for example, according to the Mobile Marketing Association, female gamers spend 25% more time playing mobile games than men and comprise more than 50% of the mobile game market, and people aged 45 and older comprise 32% of the market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you’ve determined your target market, investigate the best ways to reach these people and capture their attention.

The optimal ASO strategy will drive organic downloads, maximize visibility, and improve conversion rates, ultimately leading to all-around success for your game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Staying ahead with ASO Trends">Staying ahead with ASO Trends</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like any other industry, mobile game marketing stands to benefit from advances in AI technology. There are numerous case studies demonstrating where AI can add value and save time in the ASO process, including keyword optimization, image and icon design, and data insight generation and summarization. Some examples include:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trawling your market research to identify user personas for targeted ads or feedback sentiment, allowing you to focus on eradicating pain points and highlight positive feedback in your game’s description.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finding the best-performing keywords based on your game description and other games in the same category.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating eye-catching icons.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Storyboarding videos and creating voiceovers for ad campaigns.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Carrying out data and market analysis to identify trends in the market and among your competitors.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using insights to adjust your ad spend budget.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Analyzing user behavior to provide suggestions to improve your marketing strategy.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When technological advancements appear, new data privacy regulations are never far behind. Keep an eye on any developments in this space, as you will need to ensure that the way you use and collect user data for ASO remains compliant with any such laws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another ASO trend due to impact mobile game marketing strategies in 2024 is the evolution of app stores, sparking the need for marketers to prioritize the app discovery user experience. With the use of voice search and AI digital assistants rapidly increasing, mobile game marketers will have to consider how they will optimize their game metadata to ensure they remain discoverable and relevant.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Visual elements will be another cornerstone of the 2024 ASO landscape. Eye-catching screenshots, unique icons, and engaging short-form videos can all positively influence your conversion rate. For maximum impact, ensure these visual assets show off your game’s best features and are optimized for various screen sizes and devices.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Harnessing the power of social and influencer engagement">Harnessing the power of social and influencer engagement</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Building Relationships with Influencers">Building Relationships with Influencers</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Influencer engagement has become a stalwart of mobile game marketing strategies. Trust and credibility are decisive factors driving downloads—bringing in someone who has built a solid audience comprising members of your target market to act as your ambassador can give your players that extra confidence to click the download button and help increase your exposure and boost your engagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before you get started, condense your value proposition into a media kit. This typically includes information about your studio and team, a one-pager that explains the game’s premise and USPs, some screenshots to serve as visual aids and potentially a trailer. There are two benefits to this: it will help keep your influencer search criteria on track and you can share it with influencers to show them what they would be working with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To find the right influencers, search platforms such as Twitch and YouTube for those with a strong viewership who are already creating content relevant to your game’s genre. Make sure they post regularly. Tools such as Lurkit and Social Blade can prove useful if you would like some help with this process. Be sure to choose influencers across several platforms, as this allows you to adapt your marketing to each platform’s strengths to show off different aspects of your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building a relationship with an influencer is best done organically rather than through cold calling. Make sure you’re following them on social media. Show genuine interest in their work—comment on some of their posts that appeal to you or tag them in a relevant post of your own. When you reach out to them, keep it short and sweet. A personal touch can make all the difference. Highlight what makes your game unique and why it would be a good fit for their audience. Avoid the temptation to use the same message for each influencer you contact—personalize your message to show them you’re interested in what they bring to the table. Mention something you feel they do well and point out areas where you have common ground. Remember that influencers are busy people and may not immediately see your message—patience will serve you well. If, after a few days, you have not received a response, send a follow-up message.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you have found the right influencers who are willing to work with you and your campaigns are underway, remember that you still need to maintain your relationship with your influencers. Check in with them regularly to see how they are doing and how the campaign is coming along, but keep it casual—you don’t want to enter micromanagement territory. Allow them to feed back to you—they may have some ideas on better ways to shape your mobile game marketing campaign.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Creating shareable and engaging social content">Creating shareable and engaging social content</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get the most out of your mobile game marketing strategy, your marketing assets must capture people’s imaginations. The best way to do this is to create something shareable and engaging. The most engaging social content is tailored to the interests, characteristics and behaviors of the target audience, so make sure you do plenty of market research. Try and create something unique, intriguing or thought-provoking—generic posts will get lost in the crowd.</span></p><p>Via Pexels creator Zhang Kaiyv</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned earlier, visuals are key—high-quality artwork that is consistently themed across all assets with colors that pop rather than clash will perform well. Test your content across various devices and screen sizes so you can be sure that everyone who encounters it can fully appreciate it. Ensure that any text in images and videos is succinct and large enough to read. Consider sound and sound tagging on platforms such as TikTok to increase exposure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Keep track of and engage in current trends. Relatable, on-trend content stays at the top of search results and increases your reach. You should have a good grasp of the platforms on which your marketing appears so you can tailor it to that specific type of content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great way to spark engagement is to encourage interaction—create a challenge, ask a question or run a poll, enticing people to comment or share with their peers to invite them to join in. The ultimate tool to promote sharing is a call to action (CTA)—now they’ve seen your content, tell them what they need to do next, be that to comment, share, subscribe, or click on a link.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data-driven campaigns for enhanced user acquisition">Data-driven campaigns for enhanced user acquisition</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Key metrics to track and analyze">Key metrics to track and analyze</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any successful mobile game marketing strategy needs metrics to measure its effectiveness. There are several key metrics you can use to track and analyze the performance of your marketing:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(CTR):</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The proportion of users who see and click on your ad. In a nutshell, the higher the CTR, the more profitable your monetization strategy is.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Conversion rate (CVR): </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The proportion of users who see your ad, click on it, and then carry out your desired action (for example, clicking a button to download the game). This is the holy grail of mobile game marketing strategy metrics. Multiplying your CVR by your CTR will give you your </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>overall conversion rate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>oCVR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), which should be increasing to allow you to buy installs at a lower cost.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cost per install (CPI):</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> How much you spend on getting a single user to install your mobile game. The lower this is, the more effective your campaigns will be, especially if your CPI is lower than your average revenue per user (ARPU).</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Making data-informed decisions to refine strategies">Making data-informed decisions to refine strategies</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now you have some examples of key metrics to track, how do you leverage them to gauge the effectiveness of your mobile game marketing strategy? First, you’ll need to find an appropriate data analytics tool. The right tool for the job will be compatible with your marketing tools. Look for helpful features such as real-time data processing and user segmentation. Once you’ve selected a tool, integrate it with your game. The tool will allow you to choose the actions or events to monitor. You’ll need to regularly review the data generated and assess how well it aligns with your game and mobile game marketing strategy objectives. The tool may have this functionality built into it, but you could equally engage an AI tool to identify any patterns or insights for you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An example may be a low click-through rate that may suggest that you need to adjust the time your ad appears or where it appears. Use these insights to adapt your strategy accordingly. Other changes may include updating the keywords, retargeting your ads to a more appropriate audience, reducing your game’s price or running a one-time offer. There are several different methods of analyzing the data:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A/B testing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Providing multiple versions of your ad or game to users to determine which yields the best results. This is best done when your game is already quite established, with significant amounts of data and a sizable budget.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Descriptive analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Looking at the numbers to facilitate quantitative analysis of the data. This includes, for example, taking averages of how long a user spends watching your video ad.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Explanatory analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Digging deeper into the data to spot relationships or patterns between two or more aspects. For example, the age ranges of people clicking on your ad compared with the platform where it appeared. Data visualizations, such as charts, are critical in this method.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inferential analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Testing out theories on a sample of data, which will help provide some statistical information about your mobile game marketing strategy. This is a good starting point as it helps simplify and streamline this process compared to predictive analysis, which demands more time and resources.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Predictive analysis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Harnessing machine learning to look at the current state of play to predict future events. This is best done when you have gathered a sizable amount of data, as this will improve the accuracy of the predictions.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remember to regularly analyze your data, even after your game gathers steam, as there will inevitably be peaks and troughs.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hazelight Studios has teased its next project, and by tease I really do mean tease, as the developer has left me with more questions than answers.</p>
<p>Hazelight, best known for its co-op platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>, shared a mysterious image earlier today, showing a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes. The top paper reads, "New IP", which has been circled in yellow highlighter.</p>
<p>However, the project's actual title has been left as just a biro score line, while its release date is 202... with another biro scribble followed by a question mark. So, it could be coming anytime from now, 2024, until 2029.</p>

<p>A corner of the paper underneath, meanwhile, sees the names Mio and Zoe repeating, and as for those post-it notes, there is reference to "co-op" and then "ouch", so maybe this could become couch co-op, like It Takes Two?</p>
<p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares also shared a tease for the studio's next game. The bombastic director said he had been getting "a lot of questions" about what the studio is cooking up, and then went on to proclaim: "It is a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N."</p><p>But what on earth could S*** ******N be? Well, Eurogamer's own Matt Wales suggested Sexy Bassoon, and to be honest, if it's not this now, I will be sorely disappointed (although, would also be open to hearing your own suggestions of what S*** ******N could be).</p>
<p>Thankfully, Fares ended his enigmatic post by saying he can't wait to show the game off "soon", so we shouldn't be left in suspense for too much longer. See you at The Game Awards again, Josef?</p>

This means the game has sold a further 4m copies since March of this year, when the developer announced the game had sold 16m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Borderlands publisher 2K has announced Project Ethos, a new "roguelike hero shooter" dreamt up by Michael Condrey, the former co-founder of Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games. 
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos is the first project from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">Condrey's current team 31st Union, which was founded back in February 2019</a>. Prior to that, Condrey, along with Glen Schofield, had worked on a string of Call of Duty hits, including Modern Warfare 3 (the 2011 one), Advanced Warfare, and WW2.
</p>
<p>
A colourful free-to-play third-person hero shooter, the game visually looks similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (and the recently released and deceased Concord). Indeed, 31st Union has Overwatch DNA running through it, courtesy of Blizzard narrative designer Michael Chu, who holds the same position on this project also.
</p>
<p>
How is Project Ethos a roguelike? Today's announcement by 2K reveals the game features "powerful, semi-randomised upgrades unique to each hero" which let you evolve your fighters in real-time through each game. 
</p>
<p>
There's an extraction mode, because of course, which sounds like it offers the usual risk/reward gameplay loop of lingering to gather more resources or leaving more safely with less.

The announcement sets a date for the new park expansion, dubbed “Epic Universe,” which consists of four new worlds connected via a centralized hotel and shopping district <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/epic-universe/worlds/celestial-park">called Celestial Park</a>.</p><p>The lineup includes <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/epic-universe/worlds/super-nintendo-world">Super Nintendo World</a>, the first to open on the US East Coast following earlier versions that debuted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604504/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-super-nintendo-world">in California</a> and Japan. Some early glimpses reveal it has all the theming you’d expect for an immersive Mushroom Kingdom experience — down to entering the world through a massive green pipe — and is supposedly larger than the two previous parks. <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/epic-universe/worlds/the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-ministry-of-magic">A third Harry Potter park</a> is also one of the most anticipated arrivals, which is designed to resemble the Ministry of Magic from the original movies, and elements of the more recent <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> spinoff.</p><p><a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/epic-universe/worlds/dark-universe">The “Dark Universe” world</a> is a literal monster mash that’s designed around all the classic supernatural villains featured in Universal Studio’s earliest hits, with Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolfman running around. And the last world, <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/epic-universe/worlds/how-to-train-your-dragon-isle-of-berk">called the Isle of Berk</a>, is themed after the <em>How To Train Your Dragon </em>franchise, which may have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWfpqlCHbT8">actual robotic dragons flying around</a> over guests’ heads.</p><p>Universal says that all five realms of the new Epic Universe park (including Celestial park) will be available on opening day next spring. Tickets go on sale starting this October 22, and you can catch up with all the experiences and rides that have been <a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/epic-universe?__source=sm..TWITTER..UniversalORL&amp;campaign=Epic%20Universe&amp;post_id=14998142118">announced so far on Universal’s online hub</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
