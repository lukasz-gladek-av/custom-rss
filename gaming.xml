                <p>As ICE raids continue to take place across the US, an itch.io bundle has been set up to help raise funds for two organizations. The first is the LA-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a "next-generation social justice law firm that defends our immigrant communities against injustices in the immigration system," as described on its <a href="https://www.immdef.org/about" rel="nofollow ">website</a>. The second is the Texas-based <a href="https://raicestexas.org/" rel="nofollow ">Raices</a>, an organization that provides "legal and social services to people and families who want to put down roots in the US."</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://itch.io/b/3110/no-ice-in-california" rel="nofollow ">No ICE in California bundle</a> will set you back only $10, a reasonably easy amount of money to part with considering it's going to two organizations doing important work, but it also nets you 560 games as an added bonus. It mostly includes tabletop games, but there are a number of video games in it, as well as some game-making assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Highlights include games like <a href="https://devonwiersma.itch.io/bombing-a-graffiti-sandbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bombing!! A Graffiti Sandbox</a>, where you can practice your graffiti skills in low-fi environments; <a href="https://rocketadrift.itch.io/raptor-boyfriend-a-high-school-romance" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raptor Boyfriend: A High School Romance</a>, a "dating sim about a teen girl who moves to a small secret community of cryptids;" and the tabletop RPG <a href="https://dannymakesrpgs.itch.io/garfield-plusminus-you" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Garfield Â± You</a>, a "two player RPG about a person experiencing major milestones in their life, at which time they also are visited by Garfield."</p><p dir="ltr">The bundle has a goal of $50,000, and is currently a little under halfway there at just over $21,500. You've still got a while to pick it up though, as it's running for the next month.</p>

                <p>I thought the introduction of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a>' previous Big Bad, a gun-wielding, man-child mobster named Francisco Barbie, was pretty ruthless of the development team at Red Barrels, but Season 4's introduction of conjoined twins who work together to find and slaughter players is really taking it to another level.</p><p>Project Diarchy, The Outlast Trials' latest season of content, is coming on July 15, bringing the <strong>new Prime Assets (major enemies) </strong>to the game, Otto and Arora Kress. The twins share a single body, but are conjoined in such a way that Arora is almost riding atop Otto's shoulders, pointed in another direction, thus giving the killers more coverage when they're prowling for players in shadows, lockers, or barrels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfcv30W857o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qfcv30W857o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Otto wields a chainsaw, while Arora lobs toxic chemicals at players. Together, they have a 360-degree field of vision, which will make sneaking around much harder. Red Barrels says the pair combine to make up "the most difficult Prime Asset [players] have yet faced."</p><p>With a new season tends to come a <strong>new map</strong>, and that's true once more. This time, players will be exploring a shopping mall, which will host both the new Trial, or main mission, Kill The Politician, as well as additional MK-Challenges, which play out like shorter missions in similar environments.</p><p>The new season will also come with a new catalog, the game's free battle pass-like system of gruesome cosmetic rewards, as well as additional paid cosmetics, which this time will be split into four solo packs for $5 each rather than the typical $20 pack for a set of four. This will let players pick and choose the skins they like most, so they needn't buy the whole set just to get one or a handful of the skins they sought.</p><p>Along with all of that, the game's endgame missions return in a new form. <strong>Rebirth 2.0</strong> adds co-op options to the experience, unlike the previous version that forced players to play the game solo. Rebirth can take place on any of the major maps in the game, so it won't be the same mission each time anymore, and it will be played in mirror mode, borrowing a popular, albeit unexpected, feature from Mario Kart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385"></a><figcaption>The Vote or Die campaign is really ramping up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527396,1300-4527395,1300-4527394,1300-4527393,1300-4527392,1300-4527390,1300-4527389" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"></figure><p>"It's something that we discuss pretty often when we're coming up with new trials," narrative designer Jonathan Morrell told me. "Within the company, it's just [about] trying to find that line that we need to tiptoe. Someone will suggest something, and even internally, we'll go, like, 'I don't think we could do that.' Or like, 'Maybe that's a little too much, even for us.' And it's kind of like we go back and forth until we find that line. And so far, at least, it seems like we haven't overstepped it, which is cool, because I agree that there aren't many games out there that are as graphic or thematically disturbing as The Outlast Trials."</p><p>Community manager Rosemarie Sarno added that the team wants to "always try to keep it different enough that we know that no other game would do <em>this</em>."</p><p>The Outlast Trials Season 4 update arrives for free on July 15, though the sound of the chainsaw might cost you some hours from your sleep schedule.</p>

                <p>Majjam is the first game from the recently-announced studio Opus Major, and it's an exciting multiplayer adventure game that relies entirely on music to power its gameplay. From the way you traverse the world and engage in combat through to how you interact and explore, Majjam is inspired by "live jam" sessions--where musicians bring their instruments and voices to an improvised musical collaboration.</p><p>Majjam is described as a co-op multiplayer adventure and MMO, where you can use your own rhythms, melodies, and harmonies to work together to rescue the world around you. Music, as the world's life force, is the only thing holding back the corruptive element known as KodÃ©. KodÃ© is a dark presence that's encouraging death and silence via an ominous fog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOnYB4W_PYo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vOnYB4W_PYo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Working together, you and your friends will harness musical energy via jams, using your characters' unique abilities and instruments to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and ultimately rescue the world.</p><p>While Majjam relies on music and creativity to progress through the game, Opus says that there is "no instrumental expertise" required to play. You'll unlock more musical abilities as you progress, and each one has a specific power that will unlock the world's true potential.</p><p>Speaking about the announcement, Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin said, "Our team's dream is to make the world jam together. In music, a jam is a suspended moment--a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there. You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It's that same spark you sometimes feel in a multiplayer game. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience."</p><p>Majjam is launching a closed alpha playtest this September. Opus says it knows the first version of the game will be "flawed" but that it values player feedback. "We're inviting players not just to test the game, but to help us build it in the next months," it said. To join the closed alpha test, you can sign up on the <a href="https://www.majjam.com/news/get-ready-to-jam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Majjam website</a>. It's also available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3845650/MAJJAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Majjam is a newly announced cooperative multiplayer game where players interact with the world and each other entirely through music. It is the debut project by French developer Opus Major.&nbsp;</p><p>In Majjam, interactions occur through music, which serves as the life force for its whimsical world. When a dark corruption called KodÃ© infects everything with its silence, players must combine their musical talents and instruments to fend it off, also known as Jamming. Creating melodies is not only used in combat but also to solve puzzles and explore and unlock new parts of the environment. The Jam ability of each of Majjamâs distinct character types, such as woodwind or percussion players, is bolstered by unlockable musical abilities, which each have a unique power.&nbsp;</p><p>Players team up in online co-op (the number of which is unclear), and Opus Major states that the game's technology auto-harmonizes online players' performances with minimal noticeable latency. &nbsp;The developer also stresses that Majjam is not a rhythm game; instead of emphasizing musical skill, it focuses on communal creation and expression through simple, intuitive mechanics.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Cow" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ff262055134e0/mario-kart-world-cow.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>This week's UK physical game charts are in, and it's back to business as usual for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>After being overtaken by the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a>, the Switch 2 launch title has stormed back to number one, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a> snatching up second spot, leaving Sam Porter Bridges in third.</p>
<p>It's a largely familiar top ten this week, too. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> is right behind the top three, with the Switch 2 version making up 19% of this week's sales. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> sold best on Switch 2 this week, with 62% of copies being the newest version of the game. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is still selling gangbusters!</p>
<p>Looking outside the best of the best, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> returned to the charts this week at number 38 â those free Switch 2 enhancements are surely helping there â while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is selling best on Switch 2, with 38% of sales this week landing on the new console.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40 breakdown, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skullduggerous space MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> has changed the way its glittering golden subscription token is sold in the hellish hypercapitalist void. The change affects Plex, a shiny type of trade good you can use to re-up your subscription to the game. From now on, the ethereal digigood will be sold on a magical "global" market across the entirety of space, as opposed to being sold locally from region to region. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's not an absolutely game-changing economic shake-up, but it may mildly irritate any folks who speculate on Plex as if it were shares in (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">ew</a>) Microsoft. The change might also make interesting reading for anyone who likes to think about Eve as a petri dish for Earth's increasingly corposwamped global economy.</p>
<p>Like the laser turrets and afterburners of Eve's interstellar market, you can sell and buy Plex for big amounts of in-game money. And just like any product, it has sometimes been more expensive to buy on one side of the galaxy, but cheaper on the other side. If you theoretically gathered a few billion ISK (the standard space credit earned by whacking rats or selling dodgy antennae) you could buy a stack of this Plex stuff and pay for your next month's subscription in real life. Neat. But it might be cheaper to buy in safe territory and more expensive deep in the wilderness. </p>
<p>This change means you'll now simply buy Plex via a global pool of sellers, which will appear the same anywhere in  New Eden, according to developers CCP.

</p><p>"This friction-free system aims to boost liquidity, enable a fair market equilibrium, and support EVE's evolving economy," they say in <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/global-plex-market-and-friction-free-trade">a post explaining the new market</a> (they also offer the <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/patch-notes-version-23-01">full patch notes</a>).

</p><figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CCP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"As stewards of New Eden's economy, CCP acts as both custodian and regulator, a central bank of sorts," the post continues. "PLEX plays a foundational role in this system. But over time [...] its function has drifted. It's increasingly treated as a long-term investment or speculative asset, rather than a flexible, fluid currency meant to empower player choice. That dynamic distorts pricing, limits access, and creates artificial scarcity that benefits a few at the expense of many. 

</p><p>"Weâre committed to fixing that, without resorting to harsh measures like inventory taxes, price hikes, or product removals. Instead, we're focused on system-level changes that move us closer to a healthy, fair market equilibrium."

</p><p>For those of us not fluent in brokerspeak, CCP may basically be seeking to flatten out the price of their valuable little pretend gold bar across the entirety of pretend space. Plex is special, according to the devs, since it is also sold for real money directly by CCP. This makes it "the only item in the game directly tied to real-world currencies". </p>
<p>But it also acts like gold does in real world trade markets - a safe place for dirtbags to store their wealth. So it makes sense that CCP would want such a good to remain roughly the same everywhere. Stable. Goldish. In the short term, it may make Plex cheaper, as players selling it now have to compete against every other seller in the galaxy - not just their local star regions. In the long-term, everything may simply level out. </p>
<p>None of this, as far as I can tell, is related to the developers' ongoing attempts to drive players towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-frontier">Eve Frontier</a>, a spin-off game that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-frontier-is-a-survival-game-spin-off-of-eve-online-and-yup-its-full-of-blockchain-bullshit">full of blockchain bullshit</a> and harbouring a cryptocurrency called the "Eve Token". CCP are incresingly shy of mentioning these facts in their marketing and advertising, but you can read about it by scrolling down <a href="https://evefrontier.com/en/faq">their FAQ</a>. My advice: avoid.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/promo-girls%E2%80%99-frontline-2-exilium-gears-up-with-limited-time-drops-and-anime-expo-activation.1238205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Commanders, prepare for deployment. <em>Girlsâ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> is rolling out a series of updates to help bolster your squad, vanquish enemies, and purify contaminated zones.</p><p>For the uninitiated,<em> GFL2</em> is a 3D strategy RPG available on PC, iOS, and Android. You take on the role of Commander, leading Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) â stylish androids modeled after real-world weapons â through turn-based battles, exploration, and an unfolding post-apocalyptic storyline.</p><p>From July 3 - 23, a Targeted Procurement Event will feature three elite T-Dolls: Springfield, Peri, and Mechty. Springfield is a brand-new character addition, while Mechty is a valuable re-release for players who missed out on pulling her previously.</p><p>New elite weapons will be introduced to the banner pool as well, with each tailored to their wielderâs distinctive strengths and personas.</p><p>Inspired by the M1903 and enhanced for futuristic combat, Springfieldâs âRadianceââits name reflecting the holderâs warm, maternal natureâboasts improved maneuverability and firing speed. With its combination of power and velocity, the rifle complements Springfieldâs versatility as a fighter and supporter on the battlefield.</p><p>Beneath the alluring exterior of Periâs âAmanitaâ lies devastating power. Based on the MP5H1, the submachine gun features enhanced internals that boost its stopping power significantly and, in effect, compromise enemies quickly. Itâs an ideal match for Periâs quiet charm and deadly cunning.</p><p>The âHestiaâ is compact but lethal. Modeled after the CZ75, the handgun is an extension of Fayeâs fiery nature; a force to be reckoned with in close combat.</p><p>Speaking of Faye, sheâll also be available to acquire during this time frame via an updated Standard Procurement Banner for free. If youâre a new player or someone looking to round out their T-Doll roster, you can nab Faye for free by completing a handful of in-game tasks.</p><figure id="" data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those interested in upping their style game, all previous skins will return with limited-time discounts, as well as new outfits and weapon skins.</p><p>Springfieldâs âQueen in Radianceâ navy blue dress looks the part, but it also happens to be the gameâs first outfit to feature a 3D main screen wallpaper, on which Commanders can interact and dance with Springfield.</p><p>Fayeâs Flurry-Crimson outfit matches her temperament to a tee, tailored for silent efficiency. Meanwhile, you can add a touch of artistry to your firepower with the Midnight Waltz and Dawn Sentry weapon skins. The former gives Wednesday Addams vibes with its blueish-purple stock and black barrel. The haunting skin is fitting for Commanders who look to strike in Night Battle Missions. Its counterpart, the Dawn Sentry, has a yellowish-gold action that reflects the ultimate mission of the game: fight for a new, brighter day.</p><p>The outfits and skins will be sold at a discount at the Payment Center. You just need a Sunborn Account to purchase them.</p><p>This past holiday weekend, for fans of the 3D strategy game, the action didnât stop with their adventures on the small screen. The MICA team brought the excitement of <em>Girlsâ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> to life at the 2025 Anime Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p><figure id="" data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From July 3 - 6, <em>GFL2</em> welcomed Commanders to their booth, which was designed after the fan-favorite Zucchero Cafeâthe new Doll Spring field is the manager. Cosplayers dressed as four charactersâSpringfield, Makiatto, Centaureissi, and Sharkryâwere on-site to interact with convention-goers, make and sell drinks, and unlock rewards.</p><p>At the Training Range, Commanders squared off in a one-on-one target battle, while the CafÃ© Life Interaction Zone offered attendees the opportunity to earn a Zucchero Cookie Badge and a Lucky Draw Coupon. One Lucky Draw was held per day at the activation, giving fans the chance to win Acrylic Shikishis, Figures, Leva Acrylic Blocks, Perpetual Calendar Phone Stands, and other prizes.</p><p><br>The T-Doll and weaponry rate drops, outfits, and skins are only sticking around for a limited time (July 3 - 23), so get your hands on the loot while you can. And if youâre in the L.A. area over July 4 weekend, experience the world of <em>Girlsâ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> IRL and snag that exclusive merch. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/girls-frontline-2-exilium-anime-expo-limited-drop-1851785787]]></content:encoded>

"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One by one, sheâs hunting them down to avenge her family, armed with the same katana used to pin her to that burning tree all those years ago. But while Atsuâs story begins with vengeance, sheâll find thereâs more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a big year for blockbuster open world video games set in Japan dealing with protagonists on a quest for revenge with a list of cryptic targets to track down. Ghost of YÅtei will arrive just six months after Assassin's Creed Shadows, Ubisoft's own effort, that is set to receive a major DLC expansion at some point before the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help with the wait for more details, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-gameplay-story-latest-news">everything we know about Ghost of YÅtei</a> right here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Is Leon S. Kennedy Resident Evilâs most popular character because he starred in one of the best Resident Evil games of all time? Or did he star in one of the best Resident Evil games of all time because heâs the seriesâ most popular character? Iâll never know for sure. Nevertheless, ever since his first day on the job at the Raccoon City Police Department back in 1998, Leonâs influence over the Resident Evil series has only grown to the point that his popularity threatens the future of the seriesâ¦ again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Resident Evil 4 hit shelves on January 11, 2005, everything we knew about Resident Evil was upended. The seriesâs famous fixed camera perspective gave way to a fully 3D camera, and the infamous tank controls were replaced with fast-paced action and melee combat. And Leon Kennedy, who was introduced to the series in Resident Evil 2 as a fresh-faced rookie police officer, was promoted to a secret agent action hero tasked with rescuing the U.S. Presidentâs daughter from an evil cult. Leon became more Ethan Hunt and less Ash Williams. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/02/for-edit-re4-preview-02-b-roll-en-sub-20230221-mp4-00-05-00-19-still001-1677758817128.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil 4âs status as a Hall of Fame video game is undisputed, but the 2005 release also caused Capcom to enter a period of being lost in the wilderness. The overwhelming success of Resident Evil 4 shifted the series towards a more action-focused tone, at the expense of its horror elements. Resident Evil 5 took us to Africa, where Las Plagas-infected militia troops engaged in car chases and gunfights. Resident Evil 6 pushed things to the next level, with Call of Duty-like street battles and explosive plane crashes. But while these games followed the blueprint set by Resident Evil 4 to tremendous financial success, fans werenât wholly satisfied with the overall direction of the franchise. It increasingly became clear that turning Resiâs former everyday cops into MMA-trained super agents had eroded away the seriesâ core.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To rediscover the horror at the heart of the franchise, Capcom effectively rebooted Resident Evil in 2017 with Biohazard, the seriesâ seventh mainline game. It ditched Leon and many of the franchiseâs iconic (now incredibly powerful) characters in favor of unknown newcomer Ethan Winters who, despite a surprising resilience to a variety of gnarly hand injuries, was essentially an âeverymanâ. Resident Evil 7 also adopted a new first-person perspective that not only put players directly face-to-face with the gameâs many scares but also restricted Ethanâs moveset â there would be no roundhouse kicks here. This new formula led to sales success and the start of a new storyline focused on the Winters family (with an occasional cameo by legacy character Chris Redfield.) </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Leon became more Ethan Hunt and less Ash Williams.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the era of Resident Evil 7 and Village, there was little demand for Capcom to revisit the more action-prominent design of Resident Evil 4. Thatâs likely because, while  Leon might not have been at the forefront of the series during this time, he was still hanging around thanks to remakes of older games. Resident Evil 2 reinvented the PS1 classic in a guise that more closely resembled the over-the-shoulder, gun-heavy design of Leonâs most famous adventure, while the Resident Evil 4 remake replicated the originalâs balance of horror and suplex tackles. But as time has gone on, itâs become clear that fans have been getting antsy to see Leon headline a new adventure, not just retread old territory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, Capcom finally announced the highly anticipated Resident Evil: Requiem, and once again, the studio debuted a new protagonist: FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft. But if you look around the internet for information on Requiem, youâll see the name of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1lbbsee/leon_s_kennedy_is_most_likely_going_to_be_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Leon S. Kennedy brought up so often</u></a> that you would think he was the main character of the upcoming game. Thatâs because rumors, both substantial and otherwise, claim that Leon will appear in Requiem in some capacity, whether thatâs as a second protagonist, cameo, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-secretly-stars-leon-fans-believe-as-trailer-easter-eggs-and-actors-resume-potentially-point-to-his-return"><u>even the secret star</u></a>, depending on who you ask.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom, for its part, seems adamant that Grace Ashcroft is the face of Requiem, and there is enough information about her to believe this. Unlike Ethan Winters, who was a complete unknown when he debuted in Resident Evil 7, Grace Ashcroft is the daughter of journalist Alyssa Ashcroft, a playable character from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-forgotten-resident-evil-game-that-holds-the-secret-to-resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Outbreak games</u></a>. This makes Grace something of a legacy character in her own right, giving her greater importance and stronger ties to the overall canon of the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, during the Capcom Showcase, Resident Evil: Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi directly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem"><u>addressed some of the online rumors</u></a> surrounding Leon Kennedy being the gameâs secret protagonist, saying, âWe always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficultâ¦ No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So heâs actually quite a bad match for horror.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview"><u>played a slice of Requiem</u></a>, I can confirm that Capcom is continuing the revised formula it introduced in Resident Evil 7 and putting a lot of emphasis on horror in the new game. One of the standout details is how Grace audibly reacts to different jump scares throughout the demo, which effectively ratchets up the tension. Nakanishi makes a good point about Leon being a bad match for this type of game: by this point in the seriesâ timeline, which is 30 years after the events of Resident Evil 2, Leon is a veteran who has no problems facing off against even the scariest monsters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This makes Grace something of a legacy character in her own right, giving her greater importance and stronger ties to the overall canon of the series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the decision to maintain the seriesâ real-time timeline feels designed to get fans used to the idea that their beloved characters face a ticking clock. Even if Leon Kennedy does appear in Resident Evil: Requiem, itâd be as a member of the old guard. After all, he will be around 50 years old when the events of Requiem take place, and while Iâm sure he can still roundhouse kick a zombie at that age, having him age in real-time since his introduction in 1998 feels like a deliberate attempt to put Leon closer to retirement than in the thick of the action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think thereâs plenty of room for Leon Kennedy to appear in Requiem as a seasoned veteran helping the new protagonist, similar to Chrisâ role in Resident Evil Village. But the problem is how the Leon rumors have sucked up so much of the oxygen around Resident Evil: Requiem, so much so that some fans of the series are outright disregarding Grace as the gameâs protagonist. Thereâs a good chance Leon could appear in Requiem, but Capcomâs attention to detail on Grace tells me that developers are quite passionate about her as a character. It must be a little frustrating to see fans brush her aside for an unconfirmed appearance by Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Leon and Resident Evil 4âs grip on the newest game isnât just limited to which characters fans want to see. Resident Evil: Requiem made waves when it announced that, in an attempt to appeal to all Resident Evil fans, there will be the option to play Requiem in both the scarier first-person perspective introduced in Resident Evil 7, or in the iconic third-person perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My concern, and something I noted in my preview, is that switching between first- and third-person perspectives has an immediate impact on how scary the game is. That wider viewing angle reveals threats that would otherwise go unseen, spoiling jump scares and instilling additional fear-conquering confidence. And for a game thatâs supposedly focused on horror, as Nakanishi claims, having an option that immediately dampens the terror feels like it undermines the directorâs goals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The last time Capcom chased the ghost of past Resident Evil games, it took years for the franchise to find its way back again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in the aftermath of Resident Evil 4, Capcom finds itself again in a position of balancing giving fans what they want, between the potential appearance of everyoneâs favorite zombie-hunting agent and the choice to play in both first- and third-person, and pushing both the design of Resident Evil and the story of Raccoon City forward through the use of a new protagonist and contemporary timeframe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the developers of Requiem believe that the game can be scary and compelling in both first- and third-person, then I look forward to seeing that for myself next year. Similarly, if they feel that Grace Ashcroft can carry the next mainline Resident Evil game as the protagonist, Iâm even more excited to find out how she fits into the story of Raccoon City. After successfully reinventing Resident Evil with Ethan Wintersâ story and establishing a slower, creepier design that directly opposes the high-octane horror action of Leonâs trip to Spain, fans should extend Capcom the benefit of the doubt about Grace, Leon, and Requiem. And for the developers, I hope they pursue their vision for the Resident Evil franchise without compromise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the last time Capcom chased the ghost of past Resident Evil games, it took years for the franchise to find its way back again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-shadow-requiem-capcom-leon-kennedy-grace-ashcroft]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, when a young PokÃ©mon fan steps out on their journey to see the world, they don't get to meet the pope, or introduce the head of the Catholic church to an imaginary creature that shares his name (sort of). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But reddit user ReptileCake, a PokÃ©mon fan from Copenhagen, Denmark, has done just that â and got his trading card signed by the holy pontiff in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, ReptileCake says he took two copies of a Popplio card to his meeting with Pope Leo XIV, which took place last Saturday, July 5 at the Vatican. One copy of the card, a holographic version, he got blessed by head of Catholicism. The other copy, meanwhile, he asked the pope to sign with a half-working Bic biro â the only pen ReptileCake belatedly realised he had with him. Happily, Pope Leo XIV agreed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">ReptileCake had travelled as part of a youth trip  to Italy alongside other students and teachers from across Europe. Many brought Pope Leo XIV gifts, or mementos for him to bless. But only ReptileCake brought Pope Leo a Popplio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I introduced it as Popplio because it sounds like Pope Leo," ReptileCake wrote on reddit earlier this week. "He laughed, probably as a courtesy, but he did know about PokÃ©mon cards, he even showed it around to the guards around him. Then I asked him to sign a copy for me and he was happy to oblige."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a photo provided to IGN by the Vatican as proof of the encounter, the pontiff can indeed be seen smiling, highlighting the light-hearted nature of the exchange.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/08/01144-05072025-1751976720679.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">ReptileCake's Popplio and Pope Leo XIV. Image credit: Vatican Media</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It was pretty chill," ReptileCake recalled of his day. "We were herded through security and then seated, then the pope arrived nonchalantly, gave a great speech about hope, and then invited everyone up for a meet and greet [for] people to get some items blessed or give gifts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I went up, gave him a Reverse Holo Popplio and then asked him to sign a copy for me, in which he complied with a laugh. He felt really nice to be around."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/08/h3y8oua088bf1-1751978321393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">ReptileCake's now-signed Popplio card, with Pope Leo XIV's signature. Image credit: ReptileCake</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are many rare PokÃ©mon cards in existence, ReptileCake's Popplio signed by Pope Leo XIV surely now ranks as one of the rarest â and potentially most valuable. Still, the card will not be going on sale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's just a funny joke that his Holiness indulged in with me," ReptileCake concluded, "that's worth more than any monetary value can satisfy. "[I'm] never intending to get rid of the card in any way. It's a personal artefact that I will cherish for eternity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seal PokÃ©mon Popplio was best known, until now, for being one of the Starter creatures in the franchise's 7th generation games PokÃ©mon Sun and Moon, originally launched in 2016 on Nintendo 3DS.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This PokÃ©mon snorts body fluids from its nose, blowing ballons to smash into its foes," the creature's PokÃ©dex description reads. "It's famous for being a hard worker."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pope Leo XIV, real name Robert Francis Prevost, is the first head of the Catholic Church to have been born in the US, and became pope in May 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Vatican Media</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Square Enix has invested in a Danish indie studio to accelerate development of its forthcoming ARPG, as the Japanese company continues to look to the west for another publishing hit.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix sold off its large western studios</a> and over 50 intellectual properties to Embracer for $300m, including the likes of Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. It later stated this decision was "driven by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-feared-western-studios-cannibalised-sales-of-japanese-games">concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group</a>".</p>
<p>As such, Square Enix has most recently focused on its Japanese games (namely Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts), but by its own admission, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">the Final Fantasy games especially have underperformed</a>.</p>

<p>But western publishing has still continued at Square Enix. Publishing indie hit PowerWash Simulator through its Square Enix Collective has been a huge success for the company. That's alongside publishing Life is Strange Double Exposure last year for US studio Deck Nine Games, following previous games in the series.</p>
<p>It seems that western investment is set to continue. At Summer Game Fest this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">Square Enix revealed its new online multiplayer game Killer Inn</a>, which it's publishing for Canadian studio Tactic Studios.</p>
<p>Now it's investing in Danish studio BetaDwarf to assist with development of its Vaultbreakers ARPG, which was first announced at the start of the year.</p>
<p>"Square Enix is always looking for high-quality games and talented development studios," said Hideaki Uehara, Square Enix general manager of business development. "When I played Vaultbreakers, I was genuinely excited by the experience of connecting with other players and exploring its rich game world.</p>
<p>"After visiting BetaDwarf and learning about the team's mission and passion, we decided to invest in them to help realise their dream and bring this game to players around the world."</p>
<p>BetaDwarf CEO and game director Steffen Kabbelgaard noted the "amazing access to a combination of knowledge, talent, and resources" thanks to this partnership.</p>
<p>"We are already very far with our dream game Vaultbreakers: we have a huge amazing community, and we have already run 15+ tests with more than 50,000 players who constantly enable us to refine," added Kabbelgaard. "So getting this additional support feels amazing when we are far into production already. I can really see how this enables a home run vs having just started on an uncertain journey - yeah, I'm just really excited about our situation!"</p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a Diablo-esque top-down ARPG set in a colourful fantasy world. It will be playable solo or in multiplayer in both PvE and PvPvE modes.</p>
<p>A beta test is currently taking place, though there's no firm release date yet.</p>
<p>Square Enix's next Final Fantasy game will be its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">long-rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>, The Ivalice Chronicles. It's set for release on 30th September across PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-invests-in-danish-indie-studio-as-it-seeks-next-western-publishing-hit]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157202/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>What comes to mind when you think about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bioshock_the_collection">BioShock</a>? The remarkable sense of place? The Plasmids? The creepy atmosphere and unsettling enemies? The audio logs? Whatever it may be, chances are that it probably cropped up first in the 1999 sci-fi horror FPS <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/pc/system_shock_2">System Shock 2</a>.</p>
<p>Written and designed by Ken Levine, who would go on to lead the development on BioShock (2007) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bioshock_infinite_the_complete_edition">BioShock Infinite</a> (2013), System Shock 2 is widely regarded as a pioneering title; leagues ahead of its time and to this day one of the finest games ever made. Now, thanks to the remaster wizards over at Nightdive Studios, itâs finally available on console via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Taking place on the starship âVon Braunâ, you play as a soldier who awakens from cryostasis with amnesia, and itâs up to you to work your way through the environment and meet with Dr. Janice Polito, who helps you along the way via radio. Naturally, this is merely a slice of the overarching narrative, and like much of Levineâs work, you can expect a couple of twists and turns during your adventure that, if youâre completely new to the game, will undoubtedly shock you (all puns intended).</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157204/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay is a mix of exploration, combat, and light RPG mechanics. Exploring Von Braun is an absolute joy, with each main area presenting its own unique sense of atmosphere. Given the game's age, some of the environments look a little âsameyâ at times, so Iâd definitely recommend toggling the mini-map to give you a helping hand if you ever get lost. That said, Von Braun is a ship thatâs begging to be explored from top to bottom, and the combination of visual storytelling and collectible audio logs really help add vital context to the overall narrative. The ambient soundtrack enhances the sense of place even further thanks to its retro, <strong>Blade Runner</strong>-inspired sci-fi tracks.</p>
<p>Taking your time and navigating the environment carefully is highly advisable. Not only will enemies like Hybrids, Monkeys, and Rumblers lurk behind the corners, but surveillance cameras hamper your progress at every turn. Shoot them out if you wish (or clobber them with a crowbar), or hack into the security systems and disable them temporarily. Hacking is done by switching nodes to light up three in a line, but failing on a red-outlined 'ICE' node shuts down the terminal completely, raising the alarm, and locking you out until you're able to repair it. It's tense stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157212/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat, on the other hand, definitely struggles a bit by comparison. Itâs not for lack of options, mind: youâve got standard guns, laser guns, melee weapons, and even Plasmid-like cybernetic abilities via the spherical âpsionic amplifierâ. The problem is that, by virtue of the gameâs vintage, encounters often boil down to simply whacking enemies or shooting them until their health drops to zero, with the enemy AI doing little to avoid your attacks.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Iâd argue that you donât play a game like System Shock 2 for the combat first and foremost, but itâs something to keep in mind given the frequency with which you encounter enemies. Itâs also pretty difficult at times, so make sure you either lower the setting down to âeasyâ or save manually whenever you can to ease the pressure. If you're after a true challenge, however, then 'impossible' mode is ready and waiting.</p>
<p>Either way, you can make things easier by activating the 'Regeneration Stations' in each area. These act like respawn points when you die, removing the stress of having to reload your save entirely. If you save frequently enough, however, you might find that reloading can be more beneficial in certain scenarios.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157206/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, unlike BioShock, System Shock 2 gives you complete control over how to build your character abilities. You can increase stats across four key areas, including Tech, Weapons, Psi Powers, and O/S. If thatâs not enough, you can also increase your core stats like strength and endurance.</p>
<p>All of this is achieved via collectable Cyber Modules, which are either gifted to you upon completion of main story objectives or located throughout the environment. Theyâre pretty rare, though, so careful consideration on how to spend them is key to your success. Vending machines are also located throughout Von Braun, so youâll be gathering quite a hefty amount of Nanites, the gameâs currency, from dead bodies and crates.</p>
<p>Nightdiveâs revival of System Shock 2 retains much of the originalâs essence, enhancing the experience in small, yet key ways. Crucially, the game works surprisingly well with traditional console controls via the Switchâs analogue sticks (with optional gyro aiming thrown into the mix, too), though Iâd also concede that its complex menu system can be a little tricky to navigate at times. Should Nightdive opt to update the game for Switch 2 and introduce mouse controls, this would give it a significant advantage over the likes of the PS5 and Xbox (on that note, it plays perfectly fine on Switch 2 - no issues to report).</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157209/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The original game also included co-op play, but to say that it became somewhat unwieldy over the years with mods and bugs is an understatement. Nightdive has again revived this for the 25th Anniversary Remaster, including cross-play across all platforms. You can't join strangers, mind you, so you'll need a room code to access an online session, but having a friend on board would definitely make those higher difficulty settings a bit more manageable. Switch 2 also proves a great option here too, as the built-in microphone makes in-game chat a breeze.</p>
<p>Like Nightdiveâs other efforts on Switch, youâve also got rock-solid 60fps performance to go along with the enhanced visuals, with frame rate in both docked and handheld mode never missing a beat. Visuals might look a <em>touch</em> sharper in docked mode, but again, it's near enough identical. Donât expect anything even close to the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">System Shock</a> remake released in 2023, though â thatâs an entirely different beast; one that we hope makes its way to Switch 2 eventually â but rather something more akin to Nightdiveâs treatment of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thing_remastered">The Thing: Remastered</a>. This is very much the same System Shock 2 that launched in 1999, but characters and environments look significantly crisper without losing its core identity.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157207/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Youâve also got a whole bunch of supplemental material via the âVaultâ. Accessed through the main menu, this contains an almost overwhelming amount of content to peruse, including concept art, trailers, early screenshots, unused assets, sound clips, and interviews. The jewel in the crown, however, has to be the full inclusion of the 290-page Prima strategy guide, scanned and readily available should you need any help and canât be bothered to hop onto the internet.</p>
<p>Overall, the Vault represents an excellent celebration of the original classic and should provide plenty of additional context to both newcomers and veterans.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is a wonderful way to experience one of the most well-regarded FPS titles of all time. With an excellent narrative and a world that begs to be explored, it's not only an incredible game in its own right but should also be considered essential reading for BioShock fans.</p>
<p>Minor combat concerns aside, System Shock 2's immersive mechanics will keep you hooked from start to finish, with Nightdive's enhancements and supplemental material providing ample bonus points. Now go play it, insect.</p></section>

			<p>Tokyo Game Show 2025 is a little more than two months away at the time of this writing, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/tokyo-game-show-2025-exhibitors-list-and-main-visual-announced">Gematsu</a>, the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association has<a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en/news/detail/40012"> announced</a> the first batch of exhibitors who will be in attendance. The CESA also debuted this year's new key art for the event, which was illustrated by Zashiki Warashi.</p>



<p>So far, this year's show is significantly bigger than last year's, with this year featuring 4,083 booths compared to last years 3,252. There are 772 exhibitors confirmed for this year, the majority of them being local to Japan, while 299 exhibitors are coming from overseas to showcase their games and products at Tokyo Game Show 2025.</p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment, Square Enix, Sega, Konami, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-cancels-monster-hunter-wilds-lecture-amid-player-harassment/">Capcom</a> are among the exhibitors that are confirmed to be in attendance at the show, which will run from September 25-28 and be hosted at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other notable exhibitors include Annapurna Interactive, Arc System Works, EA, Koei Tecmo, Pearl Abyss, Riot Games, Ubisoft, and Bandai Namco.</p>



<p>Tokyo Game Show is not often an event where we see major announcements, but its placement in the year falling after Gamescom but ahead of the holiday season means we do usually get a deeper look at some of the bigger titles set to arrive in the fall/winter. It'll be interesting to see what this year's show holds.</p>

            <p>If you dream of playing a game set inside a diagram of a spacebase from a Usborne Cutaway book published in the 1990s, Kuu is probably for you. If you dream of being very sad on the Moon, tending sickly plants for 30 days by Earthlight, then Kuu is also, probably, for you. If you enjoyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> but wish it was as depressing as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, Kuu is also also, probably, for you.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's a bright and bony colony management game in which you play the titular Kuu, a "silent caretaker" for a "fragile sisterhood", trapped in a lunar greenhouse that has been trashed by a "mysterious blast" from a "long-abandoned Earth". You will divide each day between such tasks as setting up the solar panels (at the cost of blocking the light to your growpods), scouring the radio spectrum for help, and combing downloaded documents for answers about your plight. Here be trailer.</p>

<p>Being a silent caretaker, you will only be able to nod or shake your head when your sisters come to you with questions or requests. "Some will starve, and some will snap," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3442050/KUU/">the Steam page comments</a>. "It will be your fault." Good-O. Each night, you'll retire to a hibernation pod and pick through a monograph left behind by a "disgraced pseudo-archaeologist". If it were me, I'd be binging Toradora excerpts and tearfully devouring a very large bowl of cereal, but I imagine Kuu doesn't have access to Youtube.</p>
<p>Kuu is the work of the perhaps humourously named Interactive Tragedy, Limited, founded by <a href="https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/zach.dodson">New Zealand academic Zach Dodson</a>. It's the video game component of a hybrid book project which seeks to "combine traditional print design and creative writing with new approaches in interactive fiction and visual narrative".</p>
<p>While I find some of the Steam page language a little too pointed in its poignancy, I like the cut(away) of Kuu's gib. I also like the sound of Dodson's research in general, as briefly outlined in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3442050/view/528724050310070595?l=english">this Steam post</a> on how "the affordances of different media can create a narrative ecosystem", which reminds me a bit of Whitney Trettien's <a href="https://whitneyannetrettien.com/thesis/">work on volvelles</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-this-austerely-beautiful-moonbase-management-game-your-only-choices-will-be-impossible-ones]]></content:encoded>

You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together.

Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience.â</p><div id="carousel_977973"><ul><li><span>â®</span></li><li><span>â¯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Opus Major:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The rhythm of the world comes alive in <em>MAJJAM</em>, the debut project from the recently announced studio Opus Major: a multiplayer adventure game where music shapes the gameplay, from movement and combat to exploration and interaction. Created by a team of seasoned developers, <em>MAJJAM</em> is a vibrant co-op adventure inspired by the communal creativity of a live jam session, where players can build their own expressive arsenal of melodies, rhythms, and harmonies to explore and rescue a vibrant and ever-evolving world. With music at its core, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers a deeply immersive social experience that celebrates the connective power of both video games and music.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In the lively world of <em>MAJJAM</em>, players interact with each other and their surroundings almost exclusively through rhythm and melodies. Music is the worldâs life forceâa sustaining energy that holds everything together and stands as the only defense against a corruptive presence known as Kode: a dark and encroaching presence pushing fog tides where death and silence rule. Players harness musical energy by Jamming, combining the unique abilities of their character and instruments alongside their allies to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and reshape the world around them.</p><p>The ability to Jam is the main expression of music in-game, giving all players the opportunity to become musicians. The studioâs mission is to make the world jam together, so no instrumental expertise is required to cast melodies and rhythms. Jamming serves multiple functions: fighting back against Kode, exploring and influencing the environment, uncovering and solving puzzles, and more!</p><p>Each characterâs special Jam ability is supported and augmented by a system of musical abilities that players will be able to unlock, collect, and store throughout the game. Each ability has a specific musical power that further deepens the playerâs skill set and relationship to the world.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Fun and Creativity of Jamming, for Everyone</strong> â <em>MAJJAM</em> captures the joy and spontaneity of a musical jam session, for musicians and non musicians. The gameâs technology auto-harmonizes all player performances online, with no noticeable latency. Players collaborate through intuitive gameplay mechanics, not musical skill, making creativity accessible to all. <em>MAJJAM</em> is not a <a title="Genres > Rhythm [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>: it emphasizes communal creation as players express their charactersâ musical abilities.</li><li><strong>A Shifting, Musical World</strong> â The vibrant, detailed world of <em>MAJJAM</em> is constantly shifting based on player input: the environment is reacting to player abilities, responding to it, and even opening mysteries. By combining their musical expressions with others, players can reshape part of the world around them, unlocking new areas, discovering powerful melodies, and encountering surprising obstacles.</li><li><strong>A Dynamic and Dangerous Fog System</strong> â Kode isnât just an antagonistâits power is materialized in the game as a massive environmental threat; a lethal active force that defines the boundaries of exploration. Players can beat back its fog through their musical powers, and explore new zones that used to be restrained under the fog tides.</li><li><strong>Social <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a>s with <a title="Series > Persona [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Customization</strong> â Whether you enjoy strumming some chords, hearing delightful woodwind melodies or youâre percussion-addict, <em>MAJJAM</em> offers multiple, colorful character types for players to select, each with their own musical capabilities and distinct look. The key to maximizing their power comes from jamming with others, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [302 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly creating with fellow players to craft a perfect harmony and exponentialize the effects on the world of <em>MAJJAM</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-runescape-dragonwilds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-coming-to-runescape-dragonwilds-mortal-online-2-and-brickadia.1238130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three PC games are integrating NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation shortly. Chronologically, the first one will be Jagex's RuneScape: Dragonwilds, the cooperative open world survival crafting game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in early access nearly three months ago</a>. </p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds debuted to decent numbers, registering a 52K concurrent player peak on Steam. However, those numbers are long gone - over the last week, the game has stayed below three thousand concurrent players at all times, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1374490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. Anyway, RuneScape: Dragonwilds launched with support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and DLAA, but a patch due today will also add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, boosting frame rates across the board for all owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 11, Brickadia LLC will launch the namesake next-generation brick building sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, where it is planned to stay until the end of 2026. In Brickadia, users have every creative tool, such as building, scripting, and more, available right in the game with real-time multiplayer enabled. That means they can work with friends to build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes without ever leaving the action. Some of the examples of things you can craft in Brickadia include skyscrapers, all sorts of vehicles, detailed islands, spaceships, and cityscapes.</p>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and supports hardware accelerated ray tracing, boosting UE5's own Lumen, as you can see below. To compensate for that performance cost, players will find NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA options available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, the Unreal Engine 5 sandbox indie MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-online-2-gets-epic-megagrant-will-migrate-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Online 2</a> will receive NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support later this month with its first expansion, Reckoning, <a href="https://www.mortalonline2.com/patch-notes-reckoning-ptr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available for testing in the Public Test Realm</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the course of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, you will connect with all sorts of people as you attempt to bring the whole of Australia into the Chiral Network. While the vast majority of preppers are encountered as part of the story, a few are entirely optional, and can be missed if you don't listen to what characters tell Sam and if you don't explore the map fully.</p>



<p>One of these optional preppers is <strong>The Inventor</strong>, a rather peculiar guy who has decided to bring Australia's current isolation to the next level by living on an island off the coast of the continent. Looking at the island from afar, it seems impossible to reach The Inventor's shelter, as no roads or bridges are going through or over the sea of tar, but there are actually a few easy ways to reach the island, and you can even reach him as soon as you get to Australia from the Plate Gate if you so desire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After reaching the beach closest to The Inventor's shelter, use your Odradek scanner to highlight areas where the tar is shallow. These areas, highlighted by yellow dots, can be traversed safely. Before you head out, however, <strong>look around the beach to find lost cargo for The Inventor</strong>, as he won't talk to you unlesss you have a delivery for him. Once you have loaded the cargo, you can follow the safe path, reach the shelter, and connect it to the Chiral Network.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if you are not a completionist who wants to see everything Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has to offer, there are still plenty of good reasons to unlock The Inventor as increasing the connection level with the prepper will unlock some <strong>useful items</strong>, including the Otter Head at level 1, the Stun Bomb at level 2, the Remote Stun Bomb at level 3, the Bola Stun Gun at level 4 and a Custom Hologram and a patch at level 5 with which you can customize your structures and backpack, respectively.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-feasible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-support-is-technically-feasible-but-would-face-significant-challenges.1238124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 docked VRR support may be technically feasible, but there would be too many hurdles to make it a smooth plug-and-play feature.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a supporter's question asking if the dock's authentication chip is the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't support VRR in docked mode, ruling out the possibility, as the authentication process is a separate process that takes place before any sort of output process begins. The reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 dock doesn't support VRR, Digital Foundry highlighted, has probably nothing to do with the dock, but rather with the Display Port to HDMI conversion through USB-C, which makes it difficult for VRR to work on the Steam Deck. Ultimately, Digital Foundry believes that VRR may be technically feasible, as it was recently proven how&nbsp;the dock can support it,&nbsp;but the hurdles to overcome may be too many to actually make it a smooth plug-and-play experience, which is what console users expect to find.</p>



<p>On a related note, the tech experts at Digital Foundry also commented on why so few Nintendo Switch 2 launch games do not support 40 FPS modes despite the 120 Hz panel making it a feasible option, saying that, at this time, not too many titles would benefit from it. At the same time, however, some games already supporting 40 FPS mode like Cyberpunk 2077, suggests that more titles will support it in the future, although it remains to be seen how many, especially if the VRR situation doesn't improve, as games would need to be locked at 40 FPS without VRR for a good experience.</p>

            <p>If you've been enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>, but reckon its towering mountains aren't filling you with enough existential dread, there's a mod you need to check out. It's called Everest, and it fills your game with other players' dead bodies.</p>
<p>Well, skeletons to be exact, and possibly over 10,000 of them by the sounds of it. That's more bones that you'll find at Crufts, and it looks to turn the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">co-op climbing game</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> devs Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> devs Landfall into the sort of morbid fun you can usually only have by chucking a frisbee around the garden of a crematorium. No, I haven't done that last bit. Yet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Steven, who's part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> community modding group, has put down their neon sword and made <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Steven/Everest/">Everest</a>. It's a mod which "saves your death location and populates your world with skeletons where others have fallen." Lovely.</p>
<p>By scattering this spooky, scary stuff throughout your surroundings, the modder aims to create "a shared experience, potentially marking dangerous areas and connecting you to other adventurers in death." Given how often folks die in Peak, it appears you'll be connecting with a lot of corpses in addition to your own, with Steven having tweeted that one of the mod's first days in operation saw "10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players" be summoned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I made a silly mod for <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AggroCrabGames</a>'s PEAK that fills your game with the skeletons of those who came (and died) before you.

<p>The mod comes with a "detailed" config file so you can adjust things to suit your preferences and handy notifications that'll let you know if it's working or not, just in case your island not being littered with corpses isn't a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab modding framework <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">BepInEx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask">UniTask</a>, the latter being "a library used to better handle async operations in Unity".</p>
<p>I'm not saying you have to blast Drowning Pool's Bodies on repeat while you've got Everest installed, but surely it can't hurt the experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that its cozy open-world RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has passed another big sales milestone, and that a major update is coming to the game with a brand new feature soon as well.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250708/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Level-5 says the game has crossed 1.2 million sales across all platforms around the world. That's another 200,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">since mid-June</a>, a feat of which Level-5 can be justly proud.</p>

<p>Along with the new milestone, Level-5 also reveals that a photo mode is coming to&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>as part of an update that will be deployed "later this month". It will, as the name suggests, allow you to pause the action and take snapshots of your favorite moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=hYUKL2DK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=EuBOOjYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is getting a photo mode later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Options will include posing characters, showing or hiding Buddies, and adjusting camera angles, as well as letting characters show their feelings through various emotes.</p>

<p>When the photo mode arrives in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 is planning to hold a photo contest in which players will be invited to "showcase their islands, house designs, and more", so be on the lookout for that closer to the time (whenever that happens to be).</p>

<p>We're still not sure when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-fantasy-life-i-dlc-roguelike-open-world" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>Update the World!</em> DLC</a> will be released, but when it is, it'll bring a brand new roguelike open-world mode to the game in which you'll have the chance to earn new gear and more.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy some free stuff by entering the code "K9E8VADB" in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s main menu's gift code entry window, which will net you access to a bunch of nifty legendary crafting materials.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9PP7TDRDZGHD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the Nintendo Switch console family.

Over the weekend, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> (citing several South Korean sources including the <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250613133900017">Yonhap News Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?category=4&amp;n=214032">ThisIsGame</a>) reported Valve had agreed to a request by South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) to remove a mod for strategy RPG Mount &amp; Blade: Warband not just locally but overseas as well.
</p>
<p>
The mod, titled Gwangju Running Man, reportedly depicted the events of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising - in which student-led pro-democracy protests were violently suppressed by the South Korean military, resulting in significant civilian casualties - in a way that "distorted historical facts". It's said the mod (which featured military dictator Chun Doo Hwan as its cover), depicted protesters as "armed and violent criminals", framing the military's response as "justified".
</p>
<p>
As reports of Valve's response began circulating, some expressed concern that the company was now seemingly willing to remove content worldwide at the request of a country's government. Valve, though, has now provided clarification on the events leading to the Mount &amp; Blade mod's removal, saying access was restricted in March - but only in South Korea - after the company was informed it violated South Korean laws. Valve added the mod was then deleted from Steam in June by its original uploader, causing its worldwide disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Valve has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-accused-of-allowing-the-proliferation-of-hate-as-report-finds-18m-instances-of-extremist-or-hateful-content-on-steam">heavily criticised for its lack of adequate content moderation</a> in the past, facing condemnation for allowing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-steam-school-shooting-game">school shooting game Active Shooter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-under-fire-as-sexually-explicit-game-glorifying-rape-is-listed-on-steam">Rape Day</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">non-consensual sex game No Mercy</a> onto its store.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, following the controversy caused by Active Shooter, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">announced it had decided to "allow everything" onto Steam</a>, provided it wasn't illegal, "or straight up trolling". While Valve has also been known to quietly remove titles when faced with significant negative public attention, it seems Gwangju Running Man specifically fell foul of its legality rules.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you've been feeling like your shoe collection isn't cursed enough, Nintendo has announced a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and Crocs. I'll let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, a new collection of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Crocs will be launching on August 26th, which is, coincidentally, the same date on which a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">trio</a> of previously console-exclusive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">games</a> cross the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">border</a> to join their rival ecosystems.</p>

<p>For adults, the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Platform Clog comes in size ranges of 4-13 for men and 6-12 for women. These shoes will set you back $69.99, but for your cash, you'll get Crocs decorated with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed pastel shades and characters.</p>

The aesthetic is pretty similar, so you could even buy them as a matching set if you want to hasten the coming of the great Croc God of Destruction.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes themselves, Nintendo and Crocs will also sell sets of Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, and you can apply these charms to the Crocs as you see fit. A 5-pack will cost you $16.99, and you can buy individual charms for Rosie, Marshal, and Bunnie for $5 each.</p>

<p>These unholy shoes aren't the first collaboration between Nintendo and Crocs; the company also <a href="https://www.crocs.co.uk/c/collections/more-collections/pokemon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sells a set of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed clogs</a>, as well as sets of Jibbitz Charms based on the likes of Eevee, Togepi, and Pikachu, among others.</p>

<p>You can also find Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>characters, although no&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed Crocs have appeared yet, so at the very least, we haven't reached that stage of Ragnarok yet.</p>

You'll be able to get them from the official Crocs <a href="https://www.crocs.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, as well as Crocs retail stores and "select Crocs retailers" worldwide.</p>
