			<p>Today, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a major new sales milestone reached by its Nintendo Switch console, which has surpassed 150 million units sold. To be precise, the Japanese company said 150.86 million units of the hybrid handheld/home console had been sold as of 31 December 2024. Total software sales are now 1.359 billion units.</p>
<p>In the last quarter, the Nintendo Switch sold 4.82 million hardware units and 53.7 million software units, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> selling 3.91 million units and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> selling 6.17 million units. Nintendo admitted that the overall performance was below expectations and lowered its full fiscal year forecast as a result:</p>
<p><em>Although Nintendo Switch hardware and software sales through the third quarter were below expectations, Nintendo Switch continues to be enjoyed by many people. Going forward, we will continue to release new offerings so even more consumers keep playing Nintendo Switch. Looking at software, we released Donkey Kong Country Returns HD in January and plan to follow up with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition in March. Other software publishers also have plans to release a wide variety of titles, and we will strive to invigorate the platform by continually introducing new titles in addition to the existing titles.</em></p>
<p><em>We have revised the financial forecast originally published on November 5, 2024, in consideration of the sales trend through the nine months ended December 31, 2024, prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year, as well as a reevaluation of the assumed exchange rate. We have also modified our Nintendo Switch hardware and software unit sales forecast for the fiscal year.</em></p>
<p>Considering that Nintendo is about to unveil the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> with the dedicated Direct scheduled for April 2, it's not hard to imagine the original Switch's sales performance continuing to trend downward. Still, the 150 million hardware unit milestone is huge, and it means the Switch is only four million units away from Nintendo's best-selling console, the DS. The best-selling console of all time, Sony's PlayStation 2, is still further away with over 160 million units sold.</p>

            <p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace)<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forgotton-anne-devs-reveal-a-new-metroidvania-starring-a-horrifying-face-torso"> covered the announcement</a> for Forgotlings back in 2003. It's a metroidvania by ThroughLine Games, them behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotton-anne">Forgotton Anne</a> - one of my favourites from 2018. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgotlings">Forgotlings</a>, however, managed to completely slip by me until I recently noticed it had a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Steam demo</a>. This is such good news I've basically forgiven them for doubling down on the funky spelling.</p>

<p>You play as Fig, a mannequin with a face on his torso, which could be deeply off-putting in basically any other art style but ThroughLine's Ghibliness. It's still a little off-putting, honestly. The premise behind the setting is that forgotten objects - Forgotlings - wake up here as sentient creatures. Hopping wardrobes, talking TVs, and the like. As Fig, you start the demo searching for your friend Silvia in a mountain. This is obviously a tricky place to search. Lots of elevation. Could be anywhere.</p>
<p>While Forgotton Anne was basically a puzzle game with some platform elements, this one is far more of an action platformer. You'll scramble up ledges, wall jump, and slowly drag yourself up steep hills. There are still navigation puzzle elements - block pushing and the like - so I'm interested to see if ThroughLine keep up their previous's level of complexity in tandem with the combat. Forgotten Anne wasn't <em>too</em> much of a head-scratcher, mind - much more about getting to know the world than hitting it with things.</p><p>As for combat, it seems <em>fine</em> so far. You've got a nifty backstep and a block, as well as options to sneak around a bit before diving in. Still, the main draw for me here is another chance to dip into the world ThroughLine have built. I can find such overt Ghibli influence cloying sometimes, but there's enough character and charm elsewhere that the setting really does come alive as its own thing. No release date on this one yet, but I'll try to <em>remember</em> to keep you updated. <em>The name's Reuben</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I was initially sceptical that we'd be seeing dark fantasy strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whispers-of-the-eyeless">Whispers Of The Eyeless </a>any time soon. I follow the game's creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VenrisSFO">Venris on YouTube</a>. He's co-developing this with Evil Gingerbread Studio but his other big project is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer III</a> overhaul mod SFO, and it seems barely a month passes without some huge update to that. Venris once told me <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/total-war-warhammer-2/sfo-grimhammer-2-venris">he mods for</a> around "eight to 12 hours a day", though, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this cult-shepherding roguelite is now available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2523890/Whispers_of_the_Eyeless/">Steam early access</a>. Edwin described it as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>, but you're running the dungeon".

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/loop-hero">Loop Hero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-morta">Children Of Morta</a> are also influences, as is folklore from Venris's native Poland. As you can likely glean from the deliciously overwrought trailer narration, this one's about gradually powering up your cult until you've shed the remains of your humanity, and then using that newfound power for wholesome activities like bending a crumbling city to the will of various horrible deities. Like Darkest Dungeon, things like the sanity and the health of your characters have a lasting impact from fight to fight.</p>
<p>You'll need to keep an eye on cult management by inspiring "fervor" among your cultists "or risk betrayal as doubts creep through the ranks". There's subterfuge too, as you "send disciples to weaken rivals, gather resources, and spread your influence". It looks dense, which isn't too surprising considering that Venris and the team's work on SFO has been based around adding even more complexity to an already silly complex game.</p><p>Whispers Of The Eyeless's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2523890/view/545599869129065070">next major patch</a> is set to arrive later today, with various balancing tweaks based on player feedback. A short campaign seems to be one of the major player bugbears at the moment, which the developers say is one of their chief concerns for the short term. Now, I just need the modder who made these beautiful <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3383603230&amp;searchtext=">Brain Froud-ian gnoblars</a> to make a full creature collecting game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to a new rumor, Valve might be making a new Steam console. The info was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f3D79aoro8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed</a> by renowned Spanish leaker extas1s, although it <a href="https://x.com/HandleDeck/status/1886501899832021224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originates</a> from the owner of HandleDeck.com, who found out that Valve is working on drivers for the upcoming RDNA4-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-officially-launch-march-radeon-rx-9070-xt-9070-first-rdna-4-cards-for-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics cards</a> due next month. Here's the translated excerpt from the YouTube video:</p>
<p><em>It turns out that Valve is openly working on drivers for the AMD 9070 graphics cards. These cards are currently designed just for desktop devices. These AMD 9070s are the first to feature RDNA 4 technology and FSR 4. So yeah, that’s the scoop! This RDNA 4 architecture is currently designed only for desktops. It’s expected that, many years down the line, it might make its way to portable devices, but right now, it’s strictly desktop. Valve is already working on it; in fact, from what my friend has heard, Valve is putting a lot of effort into the drivers for these RX 9070 GPUs with RDNA 4. And the question he raises in his tweet, which we all might be wondering, is why Valve is so interested in collaborating on this.</em></p>
<p><em>This specific kind of graphics card and this particular AMD architecture, especially knowing that most of the graphics used on Steam are from NVIDIA, raises an interesting point. One of the main reasons this might be happening—and here’s the juicy part, especially after the recent Xbox news—is that Valve, the company behind Steam, is internally working on desktop consoles that will be branded with the SteamOS license. It looks like Valve might be considering AMD's 9070 graphics card as the main core for their desktop console. The codename for Valve's Steam console is currently Fremont, but we don't know what it's actually going to be called. It's also possible that they could use this graphics card to create some sort of external GPU for the Steam Deck 2, or it might just be for third parties to build their own stuff.</em></p>
<p>As the leaker mentioned in the last sentence, there are other possible reasons for Valve to be crafting drivers for the upcoming RDNA 4 GPU. However, the possibility of a new Steam console is enticing indeed. It's been nearly ten years since Valve's failed attempt with the Steam Machine, which was meant to deliver a PC-like experience to the living room. That was their first hardware product, and they've clearly learned a lot from it, as shown by subsequent and much more successful hardware releases like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/full-valve-index-vr-kit-priced-e1079-out-on-june-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Index</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, if Valve was really going to use the Radeon 9070 for this hardware, the console would be very expensive, which makes us doubt this part of the rumor. Regardless of these specifics, would you like to see another attempt at a Steam console from Valve? Let us know below.</p>

            <p>I'm just so tired, man. Is this a dare? Because I'm basically taking the bait just by writing about it, aren't I? "The last carrier bag you’ll ever need," begins the description of this tribute to the plastic bag <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s protagonist uses to collect bottles to exchange for cash at Martinet's local off-licence. "Frittte brings reassurance that the bag will serve your everyday needs on the toughest streets."</p>
<p>This nod to people whose main takeaway from Fight Club was how rad Brad Pitt's taste in shirts was is being sold by ZA/UM's collobrative merch store with company Atelier. They've previously put out things like a replica of Kim Kitsugragi's jacket. I'm not going to link them, as a pathetic act of rebellion.</p>
<p>As the man who couldn't afford an ambulance to get the gash on his head sewn up once said, let's try and keep an open mind about this. The bag's Dyneema fabric "is up to 15x stronger than steel on a weight-for-weight basis and provides the highest tear and tensile strength of any competing materials".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am willing to accept that this a very strong carrier bag. The brief amount of research I've done shows that Dyneema is indeed expensive, and also stronger than Kevlar. I have no doubt that, when it comes to the act of carrying things inside of it, this bag may be in some sense 'worth the money'.</p><p>But is it worth your soul, ZA/UM? Stupid question. Nothing attached to this game has escaped its curse. There was some brief hubbub over the weekend over a false rumour that creator Robert Kurvitz uploaded Disco Elysium to the Internet Archive. The actual upload had been around since 2023. It's <a href="https://archive.org/details/disco-elysium-ultra-compressed.-7z">now no longer available</a>, presumably as a result of this new wave of attention. Meanwhile, writer Argo Tuulik is currently running a crowdfunding campaign for legal fees for himself and fellow write <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">Dora Klindžić</a> in a fight to get back the Disco IP. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">three Disco Elysium 'spiritual successors' currently in the works</a>. In any timeline but this, that should be cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Me? I'm just staring at this fucking carrier bag. Trying times, soulwise. I can't even think of anything sage or witty to say about it. It feels like even gesturing at the irony is itself such a self-defeating rabbit hole of cliches that I sigh loudly before I've even finished the sentence. It's <a href="https://youtu.be/mVscQYjuq_s">just that Zoolander</a> bit again. Be kind to each other. Leave tips. Not for Atelier though. Fuck those guys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I had trouble sleeping last night, due to a combination of press trip excitement, chugging too many complimentary coffees, and my hotel room being opposite a strange, insistently symmetrical building that reared over my dreams like Sauron’s penthouse. So to settle my nerves, I got up and played a game about being a horrible tree. Just the worst tree. A total shit of a tree. That game was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roots-devour">Roots Devour</a> - and great news, if you’re having trouble sleeping you can play it too, for there is a demo in the wilds.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Roots Devour is a vegetal horror cardgame in which you, a monstrous sapling grown from the mind-flaying manure of the Lovecraft mythos, spread your tendrils through a forest, harvesting fluids from its creatures and working your way up the food chain until you are top Tam-ash, Oakranos or [insert superior Lovecraft tree pun here]. To do this, you click-drag roots between cards. The basic constraints are, firstly, that you need a clear line of sight between cards, so you’ll need to expand around obstacles such as dense rival root networks, and secondly, that you need blood to grow, and each unfortunate lifeform you snare only has so much to share. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, the poor critters split under your embrace, forming fussy piles of limbs that must be scooped up individually. So inconsiderate. When they’re drained of blood, they continue to serve you as nodes in your root network, dangling like hairy dried fruits from your boughs. Roots Devour’s presentation is perfectly icky, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a> but with deep gushing notes of Bram Stoker. It’s also localised from Chinese, so even if you're hip to cosmic monsters, you might have a bit of trouble figuring out the tutorial and lore text.
</p>
<p>
As you expand, you’ll amplify your capacities with card packs that award various boons. A card that harbours digestive fluids, for example, will allow you to seize and pacify a larger beast such as a deer. A card that harbours a source of florescence will let you see cards from further off. Some of these card packs are awarded by a mysterious human-looking ally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flora">Flora</a>, who appears immune to your predations, and is capable of sucking vitality from you in turn. Between stages, you can also retreat to your sylvan heart of hearts and expend biomatter to level up.

Roots Devour did not help me sleep, but it did make me feel less unnerved about that mildly eldritch building across from my hotel. I’m watching it now. I wrote "insistently symmetrical" before, but now that I look closely, none of the windows appear to be the same shape. Still, at least it’s not, e.g., an absolute king-hell shitlord of a tree. The full version of Roots Devour launches this year, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2612690/Roots_Devour/">read more on Steam</a>.

Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. We now know that the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">is set to launch in 2025</a>, but it will be released into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTQ5" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">The Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">The Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs</a></h2><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>You can always count on Nintendo for a surprise. This is the company that followed the Game Boy with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24242128/nintendo-ds-touchscreen-games-2004-launch">a strange dual-screened handheld</a> and broke out of its GameCube slump with a console focused on motion controls. It’s the company that lost its lead with the Wii U and then gambled on another innovation — the portable hybrid known as the Switch — to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718273/nintendo-2023-big-moment-mario-zelda">ultimately get back on top</a>. All of those were big, risky swings that seemingly exemplified the company’s playful, experimental ethos.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, is… <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">a bigger, better Switch</a>. It’s kind of boring. But it’s also exactly the right move from Nintendo. At a time when people expect their games and experiences to carry over between devices, the old console paradigm of starting over with a new generation doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. And since Nintendo hit a home run with the original Switch, it has the runway to be a little bit boring this time.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24344511/nintendo-switch-2-features-specs-handheld-dock-upgrade-comparison">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Whenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.</p><p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos">earlier this month</a>, “it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo.”</p><p>Yes, the Switch 2 will probably outsell most handheld gaming PCs by a wide margin.

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Is Building a ‘Steam Console’ To Rival PS5 and Xbox, Rumour Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-building-a-%E2%80%98steam-console%E2%80%99-to-rival-ps5-and-xbox-rumour-claims.1099386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-console-ps-xbox-rival-rumours/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Late last year, rumours surfaced regarding a developing Steam-based console being built by Valve. It was claimed that the device was being designed alongside new iterations of the Steam Controller and a fresh VR headset. On social media, tech insiders were mulling over proposed specs for a Steam console, but of course, the claims were <strong>not </strong>addressed by Valve.</p>



<p>Today, fresh rumours have hit the airwaves, with eXtas1s commenting on social media (and uploading a video) about the ‘very spicy’ claim that the rumoured Steam console will compete with PS5 and Xbox Series consoles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-competition">More Competition</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1886541769833398343?t=_-orVAMq3NTYowaQr-QYbQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, eXtas1s wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>New Steam console?</p>



<p>Very spicy with Valve, it already seems that a new Steam console is coming that competes against PS5 and Xbox in the future.</p>



<p>Thanks to HandleDeck, we have learned that Valve works closely with AMD and its RDNA 4 technologies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a follow-up video, eXtas1s expanded on the rumour – but I don’t speak Spanish, so perhaps you’ll have better luck breaking this down:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EX-CEO de PLAYSTATION ATACA: &quot;XBOX = SEGA&quot; 😨 FORZA ÉXITO en PS5 🤯 REVIEW Kingdom Come Deliverance 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8f3D79aoro8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Valve has had plenty of success with the Steam Deck, which is considered one of the best handheld gaming devices on the market, but would the tech titan see the same results with a home console? It would be welcome competition, but it could skew the existing market.</p>



<p>For instance, it could prevent PlayStation from launching further ‘exclusives’ on PC, as anyone with a Steam console could play them there as opposed to buying a PlayStation console to get that traditional home gaming experience.</p>



<p>It could also be another flop, just like the Steam Machines that Valve tried to launch several years ago.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that these rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt until Valve confirms what’s happening behind the scenes. The cards are being played very close to the chest of this gaming giant, so we’ll have to see what happens in due course.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect still hasn’t clawed his way back into the good graces of gamers worldwide and probably never will. Regardless, he’s still trying to retain some semblance of a streaming career across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumble</a> and YouTube, and recently, he secured monetisation again on YouTube several months after losing it in the face of ‘minor messaging’ allegations.</p>



<p>During a recent live stream, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm levelled some accusations at Midnight Society, the studio that he fronted until last June when things turned awry for him. In his words, ‘I can say all this s*** now.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-get-me-started-with-that-guy">‘Don’t Get Me Started With That Guy’</h2>



<p>Last summer, Dr Disrespect found himself embroiled in (another) controversy, this one concerning events that occurred in 2017. It was alleged that the supersized streamer had used Twitch’s ‘Whisper’ mechanic to inappropriately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">message a minor</a>, which the creator copped to shortly after – in a way.</p>



<p>That prompted him to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-loses-followers-allegations/">lose tens of thousands of followers</a>, be dropped by sponsors, and get cut out by fellow streamers.</p>



<p>Fast-forward several months, and Midnight Society, the studio that Dr Disrespect was a prolific part of until the allegations surfaced, is closing down. For a couple of years, Dr Disrespect provided a massive marketing pull, getting players around the world to invest in ‘DEADROP’, an NFT-backed extraction shooter that will now never see the light of day.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Dr Disrespect went in against Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was handled extremely poorly by leadership.</p>



<p>It’s unfortunate.</p>



<p>That tweet that weekend, it should have never gone out. It was never approved by me. They say, ‘after fully investigating’, whatever — they didn’t investigate nothing.</p>



<p>I can say all this s*** now.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Doc reacts to his studio SHUTTING DOWN #drdisrespect" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dygcjncJY4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Then, the creator fired shots at Robert Bowling, the former Call of Duty dev who co-founded Midnight Society:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Don’t get me f***ing started with that guy.</p>



<p>Don’t get me started with that guy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, data showed that while Dr Disrespect’s airtime has gone up, his viewership and peak counts are dropping rapidly, suggesting that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/">there’s no comeback in store</a> for the disgraced creator.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/go-media-kotaku-twitter-x-hack-memecoin-crypto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This afternoon, the Twitter account for the hollowed-out remains of a once-popular video game website began counting down to an announcement. "The best gaming token is coming... stay tuned for updates!" read a post from Kotaku’s Twitter. Some presumed that the site’s owner, G/O Media, had launched a new misbegotten scheme to staunch bleeding from the publisher’s countless self-inflicted wounds. But no, turns out the account had been&nbsp;hacked – as a result of one of the many aforementioned self-inflicted wounds.</p><p>G/O Media revoked writers’ access to sites' social media accounts years ago, following then-Kotaku sister site Gizmodo’s promotion of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everyone-should-be-able-to-use-the-public-restroom-whe-1845504927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> that happened to criticize G/O's handling of a situation involving a disabled employee (Disclosure: Everybody at Aftermath has worked for Kotaku in the past, and Luke, Riley, and I were still at the site when this occurred).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kotaku / Twitter</figcaption></figure><p>Despite this apparent desire to preserve the sanctity of sites’ accounts, G/O was careless enough for Kotaku's to get hacked in service of the most embarrassing promotion possible: <a href="https://x.com/CabalTrackerBot/status/1886533482026783025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a memecoin</a> with the name $KOTA, which is either short for Kotaku or an acronym meaning “King Of The America,” depending on who you ask. The tweets remained up for over two hours before they were finally deleted. Admittedly, Twitter is a shitshow these days – a lawless land except when it comes to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/molly.wiki/post/3lhbropf4g22t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">things that are actually legal</a> – but this situation was nonetheless largely if not entirely avoidable.</p><p>If you need a refresher, this is the same G/O Media that in early 2024 saddled Kotaku, a news site, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a guides-focused editorial edict</a> that caused its then-EIC to resign in protest. A pivot to guides has evidently done little to improve Kotaku’s flagging fortunes, with G/O <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing one writer and laying off two more</a> in November, leaving what used to be one of the most influential video game websites in existence with just six full-time staff.&nbsp;</p><p>We must conclude that there is simply no rake too obvious for these clumsy buffoons to avoid stepping on. It is inevitable that these pioneers of the ancient art of the self-own will find new ways to innovate in the coming months, and that is one of the only truly exciting prospects that remains in this dreary, imploding world of ours – or at least it would be, if it didn’t splash back on writers who actually know what they’re doing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tell-me-about-your-favorite-niche-simulator"><h3>Tell Me About Your Favorite Niche Simulator</h3></a><p>There is still some joy in this world, probably</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics"><h3>James Gunn Can’t Stop Making Suicide Squads</h3></a><p>Groups of freaky little guys are the stuff of comic book history, and maybe the future of comic book movies.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the recent LA wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Akemann's drone crashed into the Super Scooper firefighting plane - capable of carrying over 1000 gallons of water to dump on fires - on 9th January (thanks <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/local-news/ex-skydance-exec-piloted-drone-crashed-plane-palisades-fire-1236123911/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>). The impact resulted in damage to the aircraft's left wing, grounded it for several days and preventing it from participating in the LA firefighting operation.
</p>
<p>
At the time of the crash, the US Federal Aviation Administration had implemented temporary flight restrictions barring drones from flying near the Southern California wildfires. Despite this, Akemann is said to have launched a drone from the top floor of a Santa Monica parking garage in an attempt to survey the Palisades Fire, but eventually lost track of it a mile and a half from its starting point - at which point it collided with the firefighting plane.
</p>
<p>
Authorities eventually traced the drone back to Akemann, and he's now <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf">agreed to plead guilty</a> to one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft - a misdemeanor offence that carries a prison sentence of up to one year. However, Akemann is hoping to escape the prison term in exchange for 150 hours of community service in support of wildfire relief and the approximately $65,000 USD it cost to repair the plane.
</p><p>
"This defendant recklessly flew an aircraft into airspace where first responders were risking their lives in an attempt to protect lives and property," acting US attorney Joseph T. McNally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/culver-city-man-agrees-plead-guilty-recklessly-crashing-drone-super-scooper">said in a statement</a>. "This damage caused to the Super Scooper is a stark reminder that flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations. As this case demonstrates, we will track down drone operators who violate the law and interfere with the critical work of our first responders."
</p>
<p>
In a seperate statement, Akemann's defense attorneys said he is "deeply sorry" for the incident, adding he "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment, and is cooperating with the government in effort to make amends." However, they also pointed to a "number of mitigating factors that will come to light during the court proceedings", including the supposed failure of a geo fencing safeguard feature on Akemann’s DJI Drone.
</p>
<p>
Akemann co-founded Treyach - the studio best known for its work on the Call of Duty series - in 1996, and more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive, which he joined in 2016. The Hollywood Reporter says Akemann "recently left his role" at Skydance, however.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/mika-witchs-mountain-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mika-and-the-witch%E2%80%99s-mountain-has-me-i%E2%80%99m-sorry-under-its-spell.1099218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mika-witchs-mountain-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was idly thumbing through my Bluesky feed last week when I saw someone mention a game they described as "<em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> meets <em>Wind Waker</em>". I don't know if I've ever rushed to install a game faster.</p><p>Turns out the game, <em>Mika And The Witch's Mountain</em>, is <em>fantastic</em>. You play as a young witch seemingly going to a school situated at the top of a mountain, but nope, about two minutes into proceedings you're cast down to the town below, broom snapped in two. You're stuck there working as a courier until you're able to afford a fancy enough broom to get you back to the top.</p><p>The whole game is built around being a courier, flying your magic broom around delivering stuff for people, and so for the whole game you're doing little else but running errands. </p><p>Imagine some of the worst parts of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>--take this thing here, only do it carefully, but also do it <em>quickly</em>--and that's <em>Mika</em>. But it's OK! Because here those delivery-based challenges are neither tedious nor stressful; the timers are generous, the damage limits manageable, and the packages are just an excuse to get you flying around a beautiful tropical island meeting everyone who lives there and learning all about their stories.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mika and the Witch's Mountain - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYeMFMlwLJI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It's the meeting that's ultimately what's important. Everyone here has a story to tell, and they're all lovely little stories: some about spoiled kids with a struggling dad, others about the perils of licking the boots of a shit-heeled capitalist. What's more, helping everyone out all the time gives <em>Mika </em>such a wonderful <em>energy </em>to it; all you're ever doing is helping people, and that just makes you feel better every time you play it.</p><p>I've said it before but I'll say it again:<a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I love a small sandbox more than almost anything else in video games</a>. The island in <em>Mika </em>isn't very big, so it won't be long before you meet everyone and visit every location at least once.

                <p>Last month, Microsoft held its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct</a> of 2025 and announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> among other titles. But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/idxbox-showcase-to-kick-off-ign-fan-fest-2025?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of "the next big collaboration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a>," details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.</p><p>During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">World Of Warcraft: The War Within</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-report/1100-6523727/" data-ref-id="1100-6523727">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.</p><p>With Microsoft's push to release more games on PlayStation 5, it's possible that some cross-platform announcements will also be a part of this Xbox Direct. Microsoft recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5, and there have been rumors for months that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> may be going to Sony's console as well. Doom: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> are also headed to PS5 later this year.</p>

The SD cards the games were installed on were tiny while the plastic surrounding them was exponentially bigger. Most cases didn’t even come with anything else inside. I’ve enjoyed collecting them but they were a huge waste. According to a new leak, the Switch 2 cases might be even worse.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,196181,196230" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest takeaway <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">from the Switch 2 reveal last month</a></span> was that everything about the new console is bigger. Bigger Joy-Con controllers, bigger screen, bigger <em>Mario Kart</em> races. And it sounds like the game cases might be bigger too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/9p2UZtCGQI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Universo Nintendo</em></a></span> editor Felipe Lima <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1877464328762269832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported in January</a></span> that French retailer FNAC had accidentally leaked the dimensions for a Take-Two Switch 2 game at 5.12 inches wide and 7.7 inches tall. </p><p>Then last week, Switch 2 subreddit user HertzBurst <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1icr469/switch_2_boxart_size_comparison_via_leaked/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made an artistic rendering</a></span> to show just how much bigger this roughly 43-percent increase in case size would look. If these new dimensions are accurate, and not just an error or placeholder, they would make Switch 2 game cases even taller than PS5 cases, which are only 6.7 inches tall. Those cases hold Blu-ray discs, though. While they’re often similarly devoid of game manuals and other inserts, at least in that case the box is barely much bigger than the thing it’s holding.</p><p>The Switch 2, on the other hand, will presumably feature SD cartridges similar in size, if not identical to, the existing ones. What could Nintendo possibly need all of this extra space for? Is it really that afraid of people walking into GameStop or Walmart and accidentally buying a Switch 2 game for a Switch 1 or vice-versa? Or will the new console usher in a new golden age of game cases bursting with maps, posters, and other cool stuff?</p><p>I still remember buying games for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">my original Switch on launch day</a></span>. I opened up <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and it was empty except for a small rectangular nugget of plastic. <em>The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+</em>, on the other hand, came with stickers and a beautiful little gold booklet directly inspired by the manual for the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em> on NES. It felt complete. My obsession with buying games physically was rewarded. </p><p>Somehow I don’t think the Switch 2 games will, on average at least, do the same. But if these really are the specs, then surely Nintendo has to shove something else in there, doesn’t it? The company wouldn’t just ship millions of bigger plastic shells all over the world with nothing but tiny cartridges inside? Right? Right??</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft's indie-focused ID@Xbox digital showcase returns on 24th February, promising "trailers, gameplay, and reveals" from the likes of Raw Fury, Don't Nod, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a>.
</p>
<p>
If that's piqued your interest, ID@Xbox more specifically airs from 6pm BST/10am PT/1pm ET on Monday, 24th February. It'll be viewable on unspecified "IGN platforms" (it's officially part of this year's IGN Fan Fest), but expect that to include the usual places such as YouTube.
</p>
<p>
As to what it'll feature, all that's been confirmed so far is a reveal of Balatro's next collaboration. But we do know at least 15 companies intend to show their games over the course of the stream, with the following studios and publishers set to appear:

<li>Don't Nod</li>
</ul>
<p>
ID@Xbox has traditionally been a fairly long, meandering showcase so if history's anything to go by, expect it to last a few hours at least. There's usually some goodies in there, though, and this year's participant list suggests we might be seeing - among other things - more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-delays-second-half-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-for-optimisation-and-refinement">Don't Nod's imminent Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> developer Thunder Lotus' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-studios-33-player-co-op-roguelike-33-immortals-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">co-op action roguelike 33 Immortals</a>, and (hopefully) Panic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">intriguingly bizarre Blippo+</a>.
</p><p>
ID@Xbox will, of course, be Microsoft's second showcase in as many months, with January having brought us the Xbox Direct - complete with some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> surprises, release dates for the likes of Doom: The Dark Ages, and more. And if you missed the big announcements, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">convenient Xbox Direct round-up waiting for you over here</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98battlefield-portal%E2%80%99-is-returning-to-the-next-battlefield-with-classic-maps.1099155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield Portal, which was first introduced into Battlefield 2042 will be returning to the next title, DICE has confirmed.</p>



<p>The news came via the YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOih6h3VeTE&amp;ab_channel=Flakfire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flakfire</a>, who had an early online presentation of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> reveal last week. In Flakfire’s latest video, he said that the developers confirmed the return of Portal, a gamemode which introduces classic maps, weapons, and more into the latest game.</p>



<p>“We had surprising confirming in the briefing that Portal will be making a return with the next Battlefield title,” he said. </p>



<p>“Portal could be one of those slices tested under the Battlefield Labs program,” he theorised. </p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is essentially a Community Test Environment, where players can give feedback of specific features in the next Battlefield game and presumably, future DLC, too.</p>



<p>Flakfire pointed out earlier in the video that those who sign up to the Battlefield Labs program will be under an NDA, whcih presumably will still not stop people from sharing footage and information.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While we currently don’t have the name for the next Battlefield title (unless it’s just Battlefield), it has been confirmed that the game will be for current-generation consoles only, meaning it will release on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. According to EA, the game will release later this year.</p>



<p>What remains to be seen is the announcement of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Battle Royale</a>, which has been in development at Ripple Effect for the past couple of years and was exclusively reported on by Insider Gaming in early 2024.</p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Portal making its return in the next Battlefield game? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a> </p>

Patch notes reveal everything players can look forward to when they log in, including a selection of units inspired by characters from the One Punch Man anime, such as Tatsumaki, Sonic, Metal Bat, Boros, and, of course, Saitama himself. It breaks down to two Secret units, seven Mythical units, two Legendary units, and one Epic unit, but <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/16347800591/OPM-Anime-Royale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anime Royale update 5</a>’s changes don’t stop there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/31/anime-royale-one-punch-1738343679735.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">One Punch Man has come to Anime Royale players on Roblox.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Raid, Story, and Raid Shop, as well as new cosmetics, are also accessible to those who hop into the Roblox experience. The quality-of-life changes mostly focus on tweaking Meruem but also saved some room to deliver balance adjustments to Muzan and Aizen. Additionally, players will notice that the Killua blessing bug has been fixed, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime Royale update 5 follows <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-royale-channels-hunter-x-hunter-with-update-45"><u>the release of update 4.5 last week</u></a>. That patch introduced Hunter x Hunter content for tower defense fans, including even more Mythical, Legendary, and Secret units.

                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise. Given the move to Unreal is still early, a new game in the series was said to not be "imminent."</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors continue to circulate that older Halo games once exclusive to Xbox, as well as a rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">may release on PlayStation 5</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-is-optimistic-about-xbox-multiplatform-strategy/1100-6529186/" data-ref-id="1100-6529186">Microsoft's new multi-platform game release strategy</a>.

But Battlefield Labs is also likely an attempt to avert another <em>Battlefield 2042</em> situation; that game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">a rough launch</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/1/22913193/ea-battlefield-2042-launch-expectations">didn’t meet EA’s expectations</a>.</p></div><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=shared">a video</a> accompanying the announcement, EA detailed how its “Battlefield Studios” – Dice (which created the franchise), Criterion (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882537/ea-criterion-battlefield">known for its racing games</a>), Motive (which worked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">on <em>Dead Space</em></a> and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23363085/ea-marvel-iron-man-game-motive-studio">making a new <em>Iron Man</em> game</a>), and Ripple Effect (which made <em>2042’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587667/battlefield-2042-portal-custom-game-modes-vehicles-weapons-maps-ea-play">Portal mode</a>) – are teaming up on the development of this next game, which will have single player and multiplayer modes. The series is under the oversight of Respawn Entertainment head Vince Zampella <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814517/ea-battlefield-vince-zampella-apex-legends-respawn-boss-ceo-shakeup">following a shakeup</a> shortly after <em>2042’s</em> launch.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
