Fortnite's new season - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-is-coming-to-fortnite">which includes a Fallout collaboration</a> - kicks off on Friday, and we've now gotten a glimpse of how the T-60 Power Armour will look in-game. 
</p>
<p>
A brief snippet of gameplay footage - our first from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-estimated-release-date-9406">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3</a> - shows the iconic armour as seen in the Fallout games and recent TV series, stomping towards the camera. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite fans may note this location is a much-changed version of Snooty Steppes, wrecked by the upcoming arrival of an enormous sandstorm. 
</p>

<p>
The footage also shows an array of new and returning weapons set for use in the new season, including a new flamethrower weapon and gun with a harpoon on the end, a laser rifle and some kind of Mad Max-style area-of-effect healing item that grants a speed boost.
</p>
<p>
Returning weapons for next season look to include the minigun and ranger shotgun, meanwhile. Here it is to watch:

<p>
Back to the Power Armour, it looks like there will be multiple types on offer, with theming consistent to Fortnite's own Red Knight and Black Knight styles (as spotted by FortniteLeaks).
</p>
<p>
It's possible the Power Armour is offered as some kind of power-up for any character, though it seems more likely the armour is its own skin, with different variants available to unlock. 
</p>
<p>
The new Fortnite battle royale season is set to go live this Friday morning, with previous leaks pointing to upcoming Metallica, Monster Trucks, Pirates of the Caribbean collaborations - plus even more Marvel.
</p>
<p>
Last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-latest-live-event-kicks-off-countdown-to-mad-max-esque-new-season">mini live event saw vengeful Greek god Zeus enact his revenge</a> - and an ominous-looking sandstorm unleashed on the Island's horizon.
</p>
<p>Head in-game now and you'll spot the area of the Island closest to the sandstorm is now experiencing the storm's first effects, with dirt and leaves blown around. It's a nice touch. Look further out towards the storm and you can also make out an enormous boat on its way, painted to look like a shark's head. I wonder if that'll be a new location on the Island when it arrives?
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-stars-wars-mods/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Someone has turned Bethesda's Starfield into an open-world Star Wars game with over 100 mods.</p>
<p>We are still eagerly waiting for the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-creation-kit-modders-make-their-own-planet-stories-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Creation Kit</a> from Bethesda, but a dedicated player has basically made a Star Wars total conversion package for last year's sci-fi title. As said, this open-world Star Wars conversion uses over 100 mods, including several popular Starfield mods as well as custom mods and files. As mentioned by creator 'DeityVengy', this is still a work in progress, and each day, additional mods are being discovered that are being added to the package. "This is still a huge work in progress", the creator writes. "Every day I discover a mod or two to add to this as well as new mods releasing every day. I can't wait to see what the future holds with Bethesda's upcoming creation kit."</p>
<p>We've included a video showing off this impressive Star Wars conversion for Starfield below. The main mods included are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mandalorian Suit</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aliens</em></li>
<li><em>UC Empire</em></li>
<li><em>Freestar Rebels</em></li>
<li><em>Shadow Collective - Crimson Fleet Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Purge Troopers</em></li>
<li><em>Hugin's Ecliptic Bounty Hunters</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars Aurebesh Conversion</em></li>
<li><em>Starfield HD Overhaul</em></li>
<li><em>Boostpack to Jetpack</em></li>
<li><em>Unified Camera</em></li>
<li><em>Slightly Better Weapon Icons</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="I Turned Starfield Into the Ultimate Star Wars Game... 100+ Mods | Improvements | Raytracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydaWXoidoo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Detailed instructions on how to install the mods can be found on <a href="https://github.com/DeityVengy/Ultimate-Star-Wars-Conversion-Modlist-for-Starfield/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github here</a>. There you'll also find the full list of mods used.</p>
<p>Starfield is available for PC and Xbox Series X|S now. As expected, this Star Wars total conversion is currently only available for the PC version. Here's what we wrote about Starfield in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year: "With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hunt: Showdown Won’t Work on PS4 or Xbox One From August]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-won%E2%80%99t-work-on-ps4-or-xbox-one-from-august.878220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently revealed by Crytek that an impending upgrade to CryEngine – which was the engine used to build Hunt: Showdown – will take the extraction shooter offline on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from August 15, 2024. Once this update has been applied, the game won’t even load on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One consoles – but it’s not all bad news.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-upgrade-for-free">Upgrade for Free</h2>



<p>Those impacted by the shutdown will be able to update to the next-generation version of Hunt: Showdown for free, Crytek revealed. In a video posted online to celebrate the upcoming upgrade, it was said that player accounts and all entitlements for Hunt: Showdown will port across from the older version of the game with ease:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Your player accounts and entitlements to Hunt: Showdown and all related DLCs carry up to the new version at no additional cost when you’re ready to make the hardware transition.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been promised that a ‘new era’ of Hunt: Showdown will emerge in the summer with the arrival of CryEngine 5.11. For this ‘new generation’ of Hunt: Showdown, the team is working intensively on the game’s anti-cheat system, a new user interface, a recruitment and prestige system, and tweaks to the game’s Hunter mechanics. </p>



<p>There’s an inbound overhaul for the game’s core map, which will incorporate new locations and fresh threats – but only on the next-generation version of the game.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1793267296682520846" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> from Johan Pilestedt, Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios has appointed Shams Jorjani as its new CEO. </p>



<p>Following this change in leadership, Pilestedt also confirmed that they are “taking the role of Chief Creative Officer”. As a result, they plan to “spend more time with the team and 100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>



<figure><div>

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesIndustry.biz</a> today, Pilestedt elaborated on the decision to hire a new CEO. They explained that “I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side.”</p>



<p>Pilestedt added that “I will have to follow my heart,” and that “having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>



<p>Jorjani stated that “what I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership,” citing their experience with Paradox.</p>



<p>Although Helldivers 2 recently faced a lot of backlash over its PSN updates, the team responded swiftly. Ultimately, the game earned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200,000 positive reviews</a> in a single day after the devs reacted quickly to fan criticism.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 continues to perform exceptionally well, as Arrowhead’s new CEO joins the team. A recent financial report revealed that Helldivers 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 12 million units</a> in just 12 weeks. </p>

    <p><span>A decision of company founder Johan Pilestedt, who will remain chief creative officer and chairman.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em> developer <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> has appointed former <a title="Companies > Paradox Interactive [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/paradox-interactive">Paradox Interactive</a> executive Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role, the company announced. <span id="more-884076"></span></p><p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman of Arrowhead Game Studios. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, he explained that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on game creation versus the business side of things.</p><p>“I’ve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we’re going to be making, and running the organization beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,” Pilestedt said. “I realized that running an organization of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.”</p><p>He continued, “Over the last year going to launch of <em>Helldivers II</em>, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realize I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p><p>“So I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p><p>“After some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It’s not only right for me, but it’s also right for the organization. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Jorjani was at Paradox Interactive for more than 12 years, serving in roles such as chief business development officer, vice president of business development, and vice president of products. He is also a chairman of the board and investor in independent publisher <a title="Companies > Hooded Horse [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/hooded-horse">Hooded Horse</a>, and an investor in <a title="Companies > CULT Games [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/cult-games">CULT Games</a>.</p><p>“When you’re talking to creatives like Johan, it’s not like he wants to retire,” Jorjani said. “<em>Helldivers II</em> isn’t the highlight of his career. Hopefully it’s the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance… all the things that led us here.</p><p>“What I’ll be bringing to the table is organization and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was… it was about organization, leadership and business focus. It’s a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p><p>“Bethesda has Todd Howard, <a title="Companies > Kojima Productions [548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kojima-productions">Kojima Productions</a> has Kojima, Remedy has Sam <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a>… but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director… you can’t name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.</p><p>“So that’s the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more <em>Helldivers</em>, and what I bring is a structure around that.”</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios is an independent game developer based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you act fast, you can grab the coolest Nerf blaster from the Halo franchise for its lowest price ever at Amazon. <strong>Normally $100, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HMWZ6F3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-edition Needler Nerf blaster</a> is on sale for only $67.18</strong>. The iconic weapon wielded by The Covenant in Microsoft's Halo series is part of Amazon's current batch of Lightning Deals. At the time of writing (morning on May 22), just over 50% of the blasters have been claimed--this deal won't be available for long. </p><p>The Nerf Needler replica fires Nerf darts and comes with 10 Nerf Elite darts as well as a display stand to show off the item. The needs on the gun light up when you grip the handle. Note that the gun requires six AA batteries, and they are not included with the blaster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4282490" data-ratio="1" data-width="550" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4282490"></a><figcaption>Nerf Halo Needler Dart Gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4282490-haloneedler.jpg"></figure><p>It has a 10-dart rotating drum that fires off the replica needles like it would in the video game series.

        <p>Streaming site will now blur or hide livestreams involving gambling, drug use or sexualised content</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Twitch has updated its site to allow users to filter out content they do no wish to see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-now-lets-you-filter-out-and-blur-unwanted-sexualised-content">Eurogamer</a> reports the new option builds on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-introduces-new-content-classification-labels">the Content Classification Labels that were introduced last year</a>, allowing streamers to tag their broadcasts for the inclusion of sexualised content, drug use, gambling, and more.</p>
<p>The changes to Twitch means that, depending on users' preferences, any streams tagged with this labels will be filtered out and hidden.</p>
<p>Alternatively, users can set it to blur the thumbnails of streams that feature sexual content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/We-re-Giving-Viewers-More-Control-Over-Their-Twitch-Experience?language=en_US">blog post</a> detailing the changes, Twitch's VP of community products Jeremy Forrester wrote: "Our goal with these changes is to make it easier for you to have a Twitch experience that’s right for you and to choose the communities that you want to be a part of. We recognize that everyone’s viewing preferences differ, and you should have more control over what you encounter when you come to Twitch."</p>
<p>Forrester also emphasised that streamers must label their content correctly, or Twitch will add the appropriate labels and make them irremovable.</p>
<p>The changes come after years of criticism around the content found on Twitch. The site has frequently been compelled to update its guidelines on what constitutes 'sexual content', although <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-sexual-content-crackdown-causing-confusion">not without inconsistencies</a>.</p>
<p>Twitch streamers broadcasting from lingerie to hot tubs became so popular, the site even <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-adds-over-350-new-tags-related-to-gender-race-mental-health-and-hot-tubs">added it as a category</a> when expanding its tags system in 2021. Earlier this year, there was even a trend where streamers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-once-again-updates-community-guidelines-prohibiting-sexualised-content">use buttocks, groins and breasts as green screens</a>.</p>
<p>Gambling has also been an issue for Twitch, prompting f<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-updates-gambling-policy-will-no-longer-allow-streaming-of-unlicensed-sites">urther changes to the site's policies in 2022</a>.</p>

Defeat the Aeonblight Drake to obtain Perpetual Calibers.</p> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">You’ll need 46 Perpetual Calibers to Ascend Wanderer to level 90. This means defeating the Aeonblight Drake about 18 times, which equates to spending around 720 Resin at World Level 8.</p> <h3 id="h-rukkhashava-mushrooms" data-injectable="false">Rukkhashava Mushrooms</h3> <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Despite being from Inazuma, Wanderer uses <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-rukkhashava-mushrooms-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rukkhashava Mushrooms</a> from Sumeru. You can find these <a href="https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=402&amp;center=3001.17,-3853.47&amp;zoom=-1.50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scattered around Sumeru</a>, primarily in Mawtiyima Forest and Apam Woods. Wanderer’s ability to fly is pretty handy for gathering mushrooms in the branches, and if you have Tighnari in your party, he will mark their locations on your minimap.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">It takes 168 Rukkhashava Mushrooms to fully level Wanderer. They take 48 hours to respawn after harvesting, and you may need to clear out your world multiple times in order to obtain enough.</p> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-handguards" data-injectable="false">Handguards</h3> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s common enemy drops are handguards, which can be obtained from any Nobushi or Kairagi.

I found farming to be more enjoyable in co-op.</p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">For a level 90 Wanderer, you will need 18 Old Handguards, 30 Kageuchi Handguards, and 36 Famed Handguards.

 <h3 id="h-vayuda-turquoise" data-injectable="false">Vayuda Turquoise</h3> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Like other Anemo characters, Wanderer uses teal-colored Vayuda Turquoise gems to Ascend. The Aeonblight Drake does not drop Vayuda Turquoises, so you may need to convert some from another element. You can do this at any alchemy bench using Dust of Azoth.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Wanderer will need a total of 1 Vayuda Turquoise Sliver, 9 Fragments, 9 Chunks, and 6 Gemstones.</p> <h2 id="h-talent-levels" data-injectable="false">Talent Levels</h2> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The material and Resin totals below are for maxing out all three of Wanderer’s Talents. If you need to choose, prioritize his Normal Attacks, then Skill. Wanderer’s Burst, if used at all, accounts for a small portion of his damage, so you can skip leveling his Burst if necessary.</p>
 <h3 id="h-praxis-books" data-injectable="false">Praxis Books</h3> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s Talents uses Praxis books to level up. These can be obtained from the Sumeru Talent domain on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.</p> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">For a triple crowned Wanderer, you will need 9 brown books, 63 silver books, and 114 gold books. This equates to about 2,480 Resin, depending on your drop luck.</p> <h3 id="h-handguards-1" data-injectable="false">Handguards</h3> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Handguards can be obtained from any <a href="https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=209&amp;center=5688.01,1490.09&amp;zoom=-2.00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobushi or Kairagi</a> enemies in Inazuma.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">To fully level Wanderer’s Talents, you will need 18 Old Handguards, 66 Kageuchi Handguards, and 93 Famed Handguards.</p>

His boss domain is found under Sumeru City and can be unlocked after completing the Sumeru Archon Quests. However, if you haven’t unlocked the domain, you can still access the challenge from the Adventurer’s Handbook.</p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="false">Maxing out all three of Wanderer’s Talents will require 18 Daka’s Bells. This will take about 8 weeks of farming at the highest difficulty level.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fallout-crossover-event/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>There’s a new teaser available online that showcases the impending Fortnite x Fallout crossover coming to the popular battle royale game next season. It lasts just two seconds and reveals exactly how this integration will work, with a squad of Brotherhood of Steel members in T-60 Power Armor suits walking across a battlefield with an array of weapons.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-they-re-little">But They’re Little</h2>



<p>My biggest gripe with the uber-short teaser trailer is that it shows the characters in the T-60 Power Armor to be far too small. There’s something impressive and daunting about a suit of Power Armor, one of the most recognisable elements from the Fallout franchise, but Fortnite (understandably) slims them down for this collaboration.</p>



<p>In the two-second trailer (below), we see five suits of Power Armor, all of which boast a unique aesthetic. It’s hard to see at first blush, but it looks as though there are no custom weapon skins – or weapons – to celebrate the crossover event. It’s just the Power Armor skins.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>More may be revealed soon as the new season comes closer – there’s no way this crossover event is restricted to a two-second teaser trailer, especially given the recent success and popularity of the Fallout franchise in general.</p>



<p>We’ll report more when we know it.</p>

<p>According to claims in a new report <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Dealabs</a>, Sony is planning another Days of Play event for May 29, 2024, and will “last until June 12, 2024.” The event does usually last about that long.</p>



<p>Reliable leaker billbil-kun also mentioned details about the potential offers coming to the new Days of Play. They expect the likely return of a PS Plus promotion across multiple tiers, possibly repeating the same discount from last year.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 UPCOMING EVENT 🚨</p><p>Here is when we think Days of Play 2024 event from Sony should start</p><p>You can find also a preview of expected promotional offers that should hit local retailers &amp; PlayStation Direct<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a> <a href="https://t.co/wgdnWpcqOL">https://t.co/wgdnWpcqOL</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1793240436514967605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Dealabs further claims that “PS5, PlayStation VR2 consoles as well as DualSense” will be among the hardware sales. The report projects some of the pricing in Europe, such as DualSense Controllers being available for 49.99 euros. </p>



<p>Last week, Sony released a financial report confirming that PlayStation 5 sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped 29% YoY</a>. Further, Sony even expects console sales to continue declining.</p>



<p>Dealabs could not confirm many games coming to Sony’s Days of Play event. However, it did mention the event should feature God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn for just 9.99 euros.</p>



<p>Fans are currently waiting for Sony to announce a God of War PC version. Fortunately, Dealabs also made claims earlier this month suggesting that something official is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-announcement-coming-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming this month</a>. It could very well appear at the rumored PlayStation showcase expected in May 2024.</p>



<p>Dealabs has successfully leaked a variety of previous announcements and details, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-death-stranding-2-news-imminent-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2 announcements</a> in January.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not officially confirmed anything regarding the new Days of Play event or promotions.</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Arrowhead Games Studios has named Shams Jorjani as its new CEO, replacing company founder Johan Pilestedt in the role.</p>
<p>Pilestedt will remain chief creative officer and chairman. The move follows the smash hit success of Helldivers 2, which has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-full-year-revenues-rise-to-275-billion-but-narrowly-misses-ps5-sales-target">sold 12 million copies since it launched on PS5 and PC in February.</a></p>
<p>Jorjani is a games business veteran and spent 12 years in senior leadership roles at Paradox Interactive. He’s also served as chairman of indie publisher Hooded Horse, and acts as a senior adviser for various games businesses.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Pilestedt explains that hiring a dedicated CEO will give him more time to focus on his love for game creation, while giving the company the structure and leadership it needs.</p>
<p>“I’ve been thinking about the journey ahead for Arrowhead, the future games we’re going to be making, and running the organisation beyond the 120 or so developers we have currently,” he tells us. “I realised that running an organisation of over 100 people to however large it is going to get… it means I will [have to choose] between deepening my love for game creation, or the business track.</p>
<p>“Over the last year going to launch of Helldivers 2, I’ve been pulled more towards the business side of things, and not able to focus as much on the creative side. That made me realise I needed to make some decisions, both for the success of the business but also myself.</p>
<p>“So I reached out to Shams. We had a lunch, and we asked him that if I was to reconsider running Arrowhead for the next decade, and I needed to hire a new CEO, would he be interested?</p>
<p>“After some contemplation and deep anxiety on how things are going to pan out, I finally came to the proper conclusion that I will have to follow my heart. It’s not only right for me, but it’s also right for the organisation. Having a reluctant CEO is not something that will turn out that well, I think.”</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: “When you’re talking to creatives like Johan, it’s not like he wants to retire. Helldivers 2 isn’t the highlight of his career. Hopefully it’s the fourth best game he ever makes. So the question is how do we set Johan and the team up to get to that in a more consistent manner, rather than skill plus luck plus happenstance… all the things that led us here.</p>
<p>“What I’ll be bringing to the table is organisation and leadership. What I did at Paradox, where I joined as the 23rd person and then helped grow the company into the behemoth it was… it was about organisation, leadership and business focus. It’s a lot of the, frankly, boring business administration stuff that is a necessary part of running a company, which is hard to do when you’re also juggling the chairman’s hat and the creative director’s hat and also being the one who is in the trenches doing a lot of the designing that Johan has been doing over the years.</p>
<p>“Bethesda has Todd Howard, Kojima Productions has Kojima, Remedy has Sam Lake… but when you ask who is running these companies, who is the CEO or managing director… you can’t name the humble servant [laughs] behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>“So that’s the set-up. How do we enable Johan to make more Helldivers, and what I bring is a structure around that.”</p>

            <p>Nobody expected the success of Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The co-op third-person shooter, which was published by PlayStation and developed by Arrowhead Games, was released in February and has gone on to sell 12 million copies in three months. It is now PlayStation's fastest-selling game – bigger than God of War, or Spider-Man or Uncharted.</p>
<p>"Depending on who you are, you’ll always point to different things [as to why it was successful]," says Arrowhead's chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt. "If you’re a business exec at a major publisher, you’d say it is the live service element that keeps players coming back, and the cheaper price point. If you’re a game designer, you’ll point to the systematic nature of the game. If you’re an artist, you’ll talk about the day and night cycle, the destructible environments and the beautiful worlds. It’s the balance between all these elements.</p>

</figure>
<p>"But speaking personally, I would say it’s the fact that we’re doing something with Helldivers that is outside of the inflection point that the games industry is heading towards. What you’re seeing through these cycles in the industry is people taking inspiration from each other, and building upon that. But that means people are building towards a single point, because you lose something through each iteration.</p>
<p>"With Helldivers, we made the strong decision that we’re not going to go with the status quo. We’re going to place ourselves outside of that by making a lot of mechanics that are generally not seen in games. We have friendly fire on, always. I think people are surprised that we make games this way. They’re surprised that the responsibility to not blow up your friends is on you."</p>
<p>For Pilestedt personally, the success of Helldivers 2 was the realisation of a dream he has had since he was eight years-old.</p>
<p>"I asked my dad ‘how do I make a video game company?’ And he said ‘Get really good grades’. Of course, that was a lie," he laughs.</p>
<p>The problem with realising a dream (albeit a good problem), is working out what to do next.</p>
<blockquote>"We pride ourself on being an independent studio." <cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>"Helldivers 2 put me into a strange mode of contemplation," he admits. "Because the problem with achieving such wild success, achieving your calling, is you have to choose your next chapter. It doesn’t come from within like knowing what you wanted to do since you were eight."</p>
<p>This led Pilestedt to Shams Jorjani. Jorjani's history with Arrowhead stretches back to the start. He was one of the organisers of the Swedish Game Awards, which Arrowhead won with its game Magicka. Jorjani then joined Paradox Interactive, which had just signed the game, and he was assigned to the project. He helped launch that and then Arrowhead's second (and significantly less successful) game, The Showdown Effect.</p>
<p>"We then had an intense negotiation over Magicka 2, which was finally resolved in an Icelandic hotel room overnight," Jorjani said. "Both of us were drunk at the time and we decided that ‘no, we won’t do that project’."</p>
<p>But the two stayed in touch. And then in 2021, Jorjani left Paradox.</p>
<p>"I had a bit of ‘big company PTSD’," he continues. "Paradox was 800 people, ten studios in six countries and a public company. After leaving Paradox, I came to Johan and said ‘let’s do something together. We might end up killing each other, but we’ll have fun’. And Johan, as wise as he is, told me to 'f off', because he had a game to ship."</p>
<p>That game was Helldivers 2. Eventually, Jorjani did start advising Arrowhead and then, with Helldivers 2 out the door,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo"> Pilestedt asked him to become CEO.</a></p>
<p>The move means Jorjani will take over the day-to-day running of the business, allowing Pilestedt to focus on game creation.</p>
<p>"We were both at a stage where we’re wondering what’s next in our careers," Jorjani says. "And we realised we probably couldn’t quite get to those places if we didn’t have the other one to help us get there."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "When it comes to the overall direction of the organisation, I am still the chairman. So me and Shams are still going to have strategic conversations on how are we going to take Arrowhead into the future."</p>
<p>Jorjani again: "My job is to enable him and the other creative people to be able to do more games. And that’s also what matters to the players. I play Helldivers and I hear my friends ask… ‘are we going to get more stuff?’ And I’m like ‘yes, soon, because Johan will have more time to do it’. ‘We want more enemies!’ I’ll tell Johan."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Helldivers 2 is PlayStation's fastest selling game of all time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Part of Jorjani's role will be to help Arrowhead navigate the impact of Helldivers 2's success. The firm was a successful developer already. The first Helldivers game sold four million copies, while Magicka was also a breakout hit. "They were all massive games in their genres," Pilestedt observes.</p>
<p>But Helldivers 2 is on a different level. And right from the start, the team has had to contend with a series of issues, beginning with "the servers burning to a crisp".</p>
<p>"We tried to fan that… but you shouldn't fan flames," Pilestedt says. "I told people to not buy the game until we can manage the servers… but that actually increased the amount of users, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Then there was the issue around adding the need to log-in to PlayStation Network to play the game, which resulted in a backlash from fans and Helldivers 2 becoming unavailable in certain markets. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-psn-log-in-requirement">Sony eventually backtracked on the requirement.</a></p>
<p>Plus, there are other general live-service issues, too, such as concerns around game balancing.</p>
<p>"This is something the organisation has seen before," Pilestedt tells us. "We had the horrible launch of Magicka, which was really buggy, and me and Shams recognised that we had to interact with the community, talk to them in an honest way, and tell them what’s going on as much as we could. And then take action immediately to resolve the issues. So we’ve seen and been through it before, albeit at a much smaller scale. It is higher stakes this time."</p>
<blockquote>"The big difference is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community"<cite>Johan Pilestedt, Arrowhead</cite> </blockquote>
<p>He adds: "When we look at the challenge ahead of us, we feel like Frodo and Sam going towards Mordor. The oblivious approach of ‘we’ll take one step at a time, and then we will solve the issues as they come’. The strength of Arrowhead is the camaraderie that we share amongst the team, and the desire to help each other. We know that whatever we’re going through, we’re there for each other and we will be able to take on any challenge, almost, and come out stronger on the other side."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that the experience so far has been "extremely enjoyable and a little bit daunting". Helldivers was inspired by Dragons &amp; Demons (Sweden's answer to Dungeons &amp; Dragons), and the team has enjoyed playing the game master role with its community.</p>
<p>"Our game design is about transitioning our love for pen and paper RPGs into games that don’t necessarily have dice rolls and stats. A lot of these pen and paper sessions are based on a serious premise, which dissolves into farce. We’re seeing this with how the community interacts with Helldivers 2, but also how we interact with them."</p>
<p>But with 12 million fans, there's been some challenges with the community that the team hasn't experienced much before.</p>
<p>"The big difference now, which is horrifying, is the amount of threats and rude behaviour that people in the studio are getting from some really shitty individuals within the community," Pilestedt says. "That’s something new we have to deal with."</p>
<p>Pilestedt says that frustration is part of the essence of the Helldivers: "If you don't have those lows, you can't get those highs." And although this is something that is understood by more hardcore players, when you're reaching 12 million people, it's not something everyone is going to appreciate.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Shams.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Arrowhead’s philosophy has always been 'a game for everyone is a game for no-one'," Jorjani explains. "That is the company slogan. It’s how our games are designed. You can feel it in every feature. I think it’s one of the big reasons that Helldivers 2 has been so successful. It feels fresh because it does a lot of unpopular stuff.</p>
<p>"When you hit this big, much bigger than anyone thought – Sony, us, everyone – what happens is the game finds an audience outside of that niche fan group. So you get this amplification of different voices. Almost all games have a bit of toxicity in the community, but with these big numbers you just get so many, so we need to work with the community to get them to self-moderate, give people the tools to speak with each other in a positive fashion, so we can keep talking to the players openly. The more voices being added to the choir does add complexity."</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself"</p><cite>Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead</cite></blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Valve is supposedly launching a new PVP game, and I am sure they’ve put in hundreds, if not thousands of hours into how to handle toxic players, because they have that experience from DOTA and Counter-Strike. It’s ingrained into their product development and they can just lift those systems. All of that investment and process we’re learning painfully now will carry through to the next thing, whatever that may be."</p>
<p>It's something that's also a bit of a learning process for PlayStation. Sony isn't the most experienced publisher when it comes to live service products, although it's starting to invest in this area through new games and acquisitions of companies like Bungie.</p>
<p>"It’s been a great partnership and we’re learning together, and they’re recognising that Arrowhead can be the spearhead in learning how to do [live service] better in the future," Jorjani says. "It’s just great to have somebody there with you as you figure this out."</p>
<p>Pilestedt adds: "We’re always chasing our tail in one way or another. We have to lay the tracks as the train moves forward. There are optimisations and workflow improvements we can make. We’re going in and tuning the organisation to have the team work at a reasonable rate. Because, right now, to some degree, we’re burning the candle at both ends. And we want to get to the point where we’re producing as much candle as we are burning."</p>
<p>The focus today is on Helldivers 2 and getting that balance right. But the studio is feeling confident, it is a strong financial position, it has strengthened its leadership team, and is now looking ahead to what's next.</p>
<p>"We feel there we have so much more to give, and so many more games we want to make," Pilestedt says. "The ambition level and appetite of the organisation has grown significantly. We now have a taste of blood, and we want more."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ss_487d792377661b10a8ed2a5765cfcfc6893f7dbb.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The first Helldivers was very different, but still sold four million copies</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean growing its headcount exponentially, or being acquired, or going public. For Pilestedt and Jorjani, it's all about what's needed to make the games they want to create.</p>
<p>"We pride ourselves on being an independent studio," Pilestedt says. "We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realise that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p>
<p>Jorjani adds: "The goal of the studio is to make really great co-op games. We really want to turn Arrowhead into a flagship studio, where people who want to make these kind-of games say to themselves: ‘I want to work at Arrowhead’. When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.</p>
<p>"But that doesn’t mean we have to be a 500-person company. In fact, a 500-person company is quite painful in a lot of ways. We will see growth, but growth as a means to an ends, not as an end itself. We don’t have plans to go public. None of those shenanigans. Measured growth that allows us to make amazing game and be a good place to work.</p>
<p>Pilestedt concludes: "We don’t run the business for monetary gain. The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist."</p>

<p data-characters="292" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">weapon choice</a> is of importance in <em>XDefiant</em>, how you use those weapons matters. Both the technique as well as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-acr-6-8-loadout-and-class-setup-in-xdefiant/">your loadout</a> play a huge part in whether each gunfight is won or lost by you. Given the rather daunting nature of loadouts however, you might want a little help here and there. </p> <p data-characters="49" data-current-count="49" data-injectable="false">Here’s the best Tac-50 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-attachments-and-gear-for-the-tac-50-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best attachments and gear for the Tac-50 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">The Tac-50 is similar to the AWP in Counter-Strike in that it enforces a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. It’s a one-shot kill to the body but features slow ADS time, low mobility, and a ton of recoil. If you’re good at hitting your shots it’s an absolute beast, but those who miss will find it tough to get enjoyment out of it. This loadout helps to reinforce that playstyle and give it a bit of assistance. For your attachments, you’ll want to take the following:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Compensator</li> <li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Rapid Fire</li> <li><strong>Optics:</strong> Variable Zoom</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Grip Tape</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Many of these attachments lower the ADS Speed considerably, but trade that with Fire Rate, Recoil Control, and Recoil Recovery. The Variable Zoom is added in since the default 12x zoom isn’t the most convenient. You’re also forced to use a scope anyway, so you may as well improve it.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">For your Secondary Weapon, you’re best running the <strong>M1911</strong> since it provides good firepower and is great for those close-range encounters when you get surprise attacked. Slap a Compensator, Quick or Fast Mag, and Fabric Rear Grip on it, and it’ll be great in a pinch. A <strong>Proximity Mine</strong> goes very well with this playstyle to help cover a crucial flank.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-pairs-best-with-the-tac-50" data-injectable="false">Which faction pairs best with the Tac-50?</h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As for the best faction, you’re looking at either running a <strong>Phantom with Mag Barrier or Echelon with the Digital Ghillie Suit</strong> since they can both give some cover as you take your potshots at enemies across the map. Cleaners are a decent option as well with either ability but they don’t synergize quite as well.</p>

You also need to consider the attachments, gadgets, and sidearms to bring along for the ride. This is a lot of choices to make with plenty of tweaking to be done, so it can help to have some assistance to get there. Here’s the best AK-47 loadout in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-loadout-when-using-the-ak-47-in-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">The best loadout when using the AK-47 in XDefiant</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">The AK-47 is a mid-range <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-xdefiant-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/">powerhouse</a> that offers high damage with a low rate of fire. It’s perfect for lasering targets, though falls off at longer ranges with some rough recoil and especially tough handling in full auto. As such, we want attachments that help reinforce its position at mid-range, while also giving it some help for those longer ranges. With those goals in mind, you should choose the following attachments:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Recon</li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Angled Grip</li> <li><strong>Optics: </strong>Reflex</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Heavy Grip</li> <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Padded Stock</li> </ul> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">If you feel comfortable with the Iron Sights, then you can <strong>swap the Reflex Optic out for the Quick Mag</strong> in the Magazine slot. Otherwise, this build adds a ton of Horizontal Recoil Control that should make its recoil more predictable and easy to account for. Some ADS bonuses are added in so you can strengthen the mid-range gunfights the weapon is known for.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Secondary Weapon, we’re looking to take <strong>the iconic M1911</strong> to help with those short-range encounters thanks to its firepower. A Quick Mag for the Magazine and the Fabric Rear Grip assist this thanks to the improved ADS and Reload Speed. Finally, we want to round things out with an <strong>EMP Grenade</strong> for any Shields from the Phantoms.</p> <h2 id="h-which-faction-is-best-with-the-ak-47" data-injectable="false">Which faction is best with the AK-47?</h2> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="false">The best factions for this playstyle are easily the <strong>Cleaners and Libertad</strong>. The Cleaners can provide some extra damage in a pinch with the Firebomb especially, while the Libertad’s BioVida Boost will save you in a pinch. If you’re more intel-oriented, the Echelon with the Intel Suit ability can help you orient your surroundings too. It’s just more meant for the start of fights rather than in the spur of the moment.</p>

			<p>Sony's annual PlayStation promotions for this year - Days of Play 2024 - is expected to kick off next week on May 29.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-days-of-play-2023-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous years</a>, Sony will be kicking off special PlayStation promotions, and <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/days-of-play-2024-les-promotions-playstation-arriveraient-tres-bientot-51203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> renowned deals leaker 'Billbil-kun', this year's Days of Play will start next week and is expected to last between 10 to 14 days. For reference, last year's Days of Play promotions lasted for ten days across PlayStation Plus, PlayStation Gear, direct.playstation.com, and PlayStation Store, along with additional offerings available at participating retailers. Official details about this year's deals haven't been shared just yet, but the leaker did <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1793247331313148222" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage to find</a> the new logo for Days of Play 2024. You can find this image at the top of this article.</p>
<p>As said, no official details have been shared just yet, but it's expected that Sony will be offering discounts on all PS Plus tiers of around 25%. "If the promotion valid during the Days of Play 2023 is repeated this time,&nbsp;the annual subscription&nbsp;should have an&nbsp;immediate discount of around -25% which would concern all Essential, Extra, and Premium/Deluxe tiers", the leaker writes.</p>
<p>Other deals include savings on PS5 consoles, PS5 DualSense controllers, and select software titles. The following deals are to be expected (in Europe):</p>

                <p>Basketball legend LeBron James is widely considered to be the greatest player to ever step into the court, but just how well would he fare against one of the mightiest Pokemon of all time? <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stephen-a-smith-chooses-his-starter-pokemon/1100-6520630/">Pokemon starter expert</a> and sports commentator Stephen A. Smith was asked who he'd pick to win in a basketball game between LeBron and Mewtwo, and the TV personality believes that the genetically engineered Pokemon would actually stand a good chance of beating the NBA MVP in a game of 21.</p><p>"He's shorter than LeBron but he weighs more," Smith said in a serious analysis of Mewtwo's stats. "He can anticipate moves and stuff like that. Yeah, maybe he could pull it off. From the looks of him, he might scare LeBron. LeBron might want to shoot more jump-shots, might not want to come near him. That long tail, you never know. Might trip him. I'm not saying it definitely would happen, but it's possible. It's possible, let's go with that."</p><p>As Smith noted, Mewtwo is pretty tall, and as a Psychic-type, Pokemon he has several advantages. As demonstrated in the first Pokemon movie, Mewtwo probably wouldn't have a hard time taking control of the ball, predicting what LeBron would do next, or reflecting on the contest with <a href="https://youtu.be/UQoGyeeT2pw" rel="nofollow ">Shakespearian eloquence</a>. And that's before you factor in Mewtwo's mega-evolutions. And in case you're wondering, Smith also knows exact who would win in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stephen-a-smith-knows-exactly-who-would-win-in-a-stuart-little-vs-ratatouille-fight/1100-6520869/" data-ref-id="1100-6520869">fight between Stuart Little and Ratatoutille</a>. </p><p>In other pocket monster news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-pokemon-available-for-scarlet-and-violet-for-a-limited-time/1100-6523585/">a free Pokemon is available for a limited time in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/total-war-star-wars-and-counterintuitive-historical-accuracy.878145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/total-war-star-wars/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When <em>Dualshockers </em>reported that Creative Assembly is developing a <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/?ref=remapradio.com"><u><em>Star Wars </em>version of their <em>Total War </em>series</u></a>, the most common reaction I saw was one of skepticism. At first glance, <em>Star Wars</em> does not seem to lend itself to the combat of massed armies and close, linear formations that has been <em>Total War’s</em> bread-and-butter since its inception.</p><p>At a glance, <em>Star Wars </em>appears to be a setting where warfare is analogous to World War 2 combat: soldiers carry automatic or semi-automatic blasters, walkers function like tanks, starfighters are basically WW2 airplanes and a lot of them are carried aboard capital ships that act like aircraft carriers. By contrast, the <em>Total War </em>series has always handled pre-gunpowder armies best, and its forays into the 18th and 19th centuries have been uneven. (Why that is the case is a topic for another day.)</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's just a catapult! </span><i><em>Total War </em></i><span>can handle a catapult. Which is more than can be said for the Droid Army.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more <em>Star Wars </em>battles we have gotten to see, however, the less they fit that “World War 2 in Space” paradigm. Throughout the <em>Clone Wars </em>cartoon, ground combat between the Separatist Droid Army and the Grand Army of the Republic is defined by massed formations exchanging laser fire at close range. Is this in large part dictated by the limitations of the cartoon’s animation capabilities? Almost certainly, but it is also following the template Lucas established in <em>Phantom Menance </em>and <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, where the former is basically a battle of Roman legionary armies, and the latter is a point-blank melee as masses of droids try and shatter walls of clones and Jedi defenders. </p><!--members-only--><p>Hoth, likewise, doesn’t much resemble a World War 2 battle so much as a World War 1 battle or perhaps something even earlier. The AT-AT walkers are more capable than World War 1’s first tanks, but they share similar drawbacks: they are devastatingly effective at shattering an enemy line but also slow and unmaneuverable. (Their performance gets even less impressive if you read Danger Room’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/02/battle-of-hoth/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>analysis of Rebel defensive tactics on Hoth</u></a>, or this piece <a href="https://cimsec.org/re-fighting-the-battle-of-hoth-an-engineers-perspective/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>re-imagining how the Rebels could have deployed the same resources</u></a> to keep the Imperials at bay, which is coincidentally a good primer on how armies evolved tactics to mitigate the threat of armored breakthroughs.) The biggest ground battle we get in the original trilogy is an assault on a besieged fortress, frankly the kind that happened a lot more <em>before </em>the World Wars than after.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Ralph McQuarrie's concept painting for the Hoth Battle, displayed at Disney World</span></figcaption></figure><p>If there is any one battle that looks different from what Total War is usually about, it’s the Umbara campaign in <em>The Clone Wars. </em> Perhaps the most impressive depiction of battle in the entire series, the landings on Umbara resembled a combination of the paratroopers going into Normandy and helicopter-led US air assault tactics in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p><p>The Umbarans rely heavily on area-denial weapons, plus disruptive long range firepower that inflicted major losses on the Clone Army before they can get into small-arms range of Umbaran forces.  When the clones finally get into range of those forces, the Umbarans are piloting advanced vehicles with no support.  Effectively, it's a mechanized monster fight—and we've seen lots of monster fights in the <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>series. </p><p>(Plus, the Republic’s tactics were hindered in this battle by the fact that the Jedi in command was a turncoat. Did our glimpse of the Umbaran campaign look so different from other battles because it was truly a different tactical paradigm, or was it just that the commanding general was intentionally inflicting attrition on his forces?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>Diagram of a shipboard mass driver cannon in </span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><span>Battles That Changed the Galaxy</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>What of space? That’s a little harder to make guesses about. Naval warfare is something the <em>Total War </em>series has struggled with over the years, but if it could be said to have worked at all it was with games like <em>Empire </em>and <em>Fall of the Samurai</em>, where you’re basically dealing with the 18th and 19th century naval tactics—<em>Master and Commander </em>type stuff. </p><p>The thing is, that’s basically what we see in the largest naval battle in the <em>Star Wars </em>films. Lando Calrissian’s solution to the ambush at Endor is to have Ackbar bring his capital ships into point-blank range with the Imperial Star Destroyers surrounding the Second Death Star, while he and his strike craft fly cover until they can attack the Death Star itself. Unlike in real-world history, the development of strike aircraft didn’t render the battleship obsolete, and so most naval battles appear to be decided by the presence of capital ships fighting well inside visual range of one another using actual cannons with heavy artillery shells like warships used from the 16th through the 20th centuries. The biggest naval battles we see in the prequel trilogy follow similar logic, and the glimpses we get of the Imperial Navy on the fringes of the Empire in <em>Andor </em>and <em>Rebels</em> indicate that the fleet is predominated by small patrol craft and light carriers, and that the almost-invulnerable Imperial Star Destroyer is as scarce as a sight as a Ship of the Line on the far frontiers of 18th century empires.</p><figure><figcaption><span>A naval battle diagram for the Battle of Endor of the kind that is very familiar to anyone who appreciates the age of fighting sail.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final thing I would note is that Jedi, Sith, Force Witches, and even the types of special units that emerge from within the conventional armies of <em>Star Wars</em>—like the coldly competent Tactical Droids, elite combat commanders like Rex and his badass buddy Fives—are basically hero units and both <em>Total War: Warhammer </em>and <em>Three Kingdoms </em>showed that Creative Assembly is capable of putting special units like that into game system without making it fall apart. Personally, I think the way it approached hero units in <em>Three Kingdoms </em>is a bit more in keeping with <em>Star Wars</em> (there’s only one Anakin Skywalker just like there’s only one Lu Bu) but you can see it working a few different ways.</p><p>So it isn’t hard to imagine Creative Assembly depicting battles that feel authentically <em>Star Wars</em>. The films have never been particularly interested in convincing military tactics as much as they have privileged packing a frame with scenes of awesome combat. The <em>Total War </em>series has always been similar: its battles look like movies or military paintings more than actual combat as related by participants, where war is always harder to perceive and understand in the confusion of battle. You can very easily imagine a lot of typical <em>Total War </em>battles unfolding with the types of armies we see throughout <em>Star Wars </em>films and television.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Like this has never happened to you in a Total War game.</span></figcaption></figure><p>The more doubtful thing, at this stage in Creative Assembly’s life as a studio, is whether it can make a game that feels authentic and interesting with the wildly varied source material of <em>Star Wars</em>. The studio’s model has increasingly shifted to DLC—to the point that a lot of folks have come to believe <em>Total War </em>can only work if a setting can support dozens of factions—and it isn’t hard to imagine a Star Wars game that feels like a thinly reskinned Total War game of the type we’ve seen countless times before, with variation coming via fanciful DLC packs that start to resemble the goofy <em>Star Wars </em>action figures and playsets of the past. I think if this comes to fruition we have every chance of seeing a surprisingly good <em>Star Wars </em>game at launch… and then two years later playing an increasingly poorly-balanced and buggy version of the same game as we try out the new Hutts of Hoth Expansion and await <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/message-from-total-war-leadership-dec-2023/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the inevitable blog post</u></a> titled “An Apology and a Roadmap for the Hutts of Hoth”.</p><p><em>P.S. Because some folks are going to miss the link in the caption: the stills throughout this piece are from </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672347/star-wars-battles-that-changed-the-galaxy-by-cole-horton-jason-fry-amy-ratcliffe-chris-kempshall/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Battles That Changed the Galaxy</em></a><em>, which is quite a lot of fun as a work of fictional military history, in the form of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Battles-World-War-I/dp/B000KT4W7I?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>exactly the kind of history book</em></a><em> that set me on course to be whatever the hell I am today.</em></p>

Smash Bros.-style brawler launches proper on May 28 after it was brought offline following what is now called the open beta period.</p><p>In a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Player First Games said returning players who log in by June 11 get the Season 1 premium battle pass for free. This means they also get playable character Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th for free.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/jason-1920-1080-1536x864-1716374436634.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Player First Games revealed a first look at the battle pass interface, which gives off strong Fortnite vibes. “We’ve increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers by adding more ringouts, character variants, taunts, and currency,” Player First Games said.</p><p>You can now earn the premium currency (Gleamium) through both tiers, which can be used to buy various in-game items, whether it’s for new characters or saving to use towards the next season’s premium battle pass.</p><p>Jason Voorhees is part of the premium battle pass, as are more variants, ringouts, taunts, and currency. The premium battle pass also lets you earn enough Gleamium to get the next premium battle pass, Player First Games confirmed. Jason Voorhees will also be available via character tokens or in-game currency when the pass is over.</p><p>At launch, the Season 1 battle pass will last for eight weeks, and the final tier of the pass will be repeatable, so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you reach the end of it early.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/image-63-1536x842-1716374462561.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Returning players who already have existing character tokens in their inventory can still use them to unlock characters, but MultiVersus will not offer new character tokens from launch. Neither will it offer new battle pass tokens, but if you already have some you can still use them to unlock the premium battle pass tier.</p><p>Player First Games has introduced new replacement currencies “to focus more on specific reward types.” Fighter currency can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters. “Keep in mind, Fighter currency is different from character tokens, and it cannot be exchanged for character tokens,” Player First Games warned. Players can also try out new characters through the weekly free character rotation, which will work the same way as it did during the open beta.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, there is a separate Perk currency you can use to get perks. And there’s a Prestige currency that “rewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters.” Each cosmetic item you get awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity. Eventually, you’ll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game, Player First Games explained. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency. </p><p>“When we launch, all returning players will receive an allotment of Prestige currency based on the number of cosmetics they acquired during the open beta as a reward for all previous purchases and unlocks,” the developer added.</p><p>That’s four separate virtual currencies for the free-to-play brawler. It’s all a bit confusing, so hopefully the below image adds some clarity:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/22/mvs-currency-redux-5-1536x864-1716374479417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Warner Bros. Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Gold currency previously available is no more. Player First Games said it will dish out commemorative cosmetics that correlate to a player’s Gold earned during the open beta. These are exclusive items that can’t be earned any other way.</p><p>And finally, Player First Games will reset all perks from the open beta. As mentioned, perks are now unlocked using the Perk currency, attainable through playing the game, and all players will receive an allotment that correlates to the number of perks unlocked from the open beta. Player and account mastery tracks will be set to level one at launch. “Mastery tracks are a great way to give you both short-term and long-term goals when starting out, and ultimately, we want to give all players the chance to earn lots of items,” Player First Games said.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-jason-voorhees-from-friday-the-13th-and-agent-smith-from-the-matrix">Warner Bros. revealed two new playable characters for MultiVersus</a>: the aforementioned Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix. Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith join the MultiVersus roster alongside DC Super-Villain The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy. Jason Voorhees is available at launch, while Agent Smith will release later in the season.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’d think after Nintendo shut down the Nintendo Network servers for the 3DS and Wii U in April, even the most die-hard of players would move on. Yet here we are, over a month later, and there’s reportedly three people who are somehow still connected to the Nintendo Network, and it only recently used to be four.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">This is according to <a href="https://x.com/GaffsNotLaffs/status/1792952060884791574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Gaffs</a>, who runs a Nintendo Network After Hours Discord and has been documenting the aftermath of the servers being shutdown. One of the players, Lcd101, we already reported on last month as they’ve been sharing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-dedicated-splatoon-wii-u-player-is-still-online-even-with-matchmaking-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily updates on what <em>Splatoon 1</em> looks like</a> now that its online features don’t work. The other two are Fishguy6564 in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mario-kart-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart 7</a></em> and SlitherySheep in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-maker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario Maker</a></em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">A fourth player, <a href="https://x.com/xc_omoroid/status/1792893304184660119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xc_omoroid on Twitter</a>, used to part of this exclusive crowd, having stayed connected to the servers for RPG <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-xenoblade-chronicles-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>. Although it’s primarily a single-player game, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> did boast online functionality, allowing players to share their custom characters so others could use them in their party. Thankfully, the game is still functional even without the servers, but xc_omoroid decided to see how long they could stay online following the shutdown.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">They were finally booted from the game on May 21, which they consider a “miracle” since <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>‘s netcode apparently wasn’t very good; they even describe it as the worst of any Wii U game. In <a href="https://x.com/xc_omoroid/status/1792896287068848518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a>, they said they also managed to beat all the online exclusive content, assuring they’ll forever have a truly complete save file. Honestly, this reminds me how I never got round to playing <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> myself and, even though the servers are gone, I’m half tempted to dig out my old copy.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">I have to imagine the remaining three players won’t stay connected to their respective games for much longer. Then again, I would’ve thought that one week after the servers shut down and yet they’ve lasted for over a month. At this rate, they could make it well into June. Whatever the case, they will be booted eventually, and then it will truly be an end of an era.</p>

            <p>Sony has shared a new job vacancy for a Mobile Platform Architect at PlayStation Global.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentglobal/jobs/5078757004">listing</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/98435/sony-developing-playstation-mobile-platform/index.html">TweakTown</a>, shows the company is looking for an engineer to design a PlayStation platform which will focus on "developing, publishing, and operating free-to-play mobile games".</p>
<p>Among the responsibilities, the successful candidate will be expected to assist the platform's engineering team with "technical leadership and guidance", contribute to the mobile platform's roadmap, establish "pipelines and processes to facilitate the delivery of high-quality software" and track" technical innovations, changes, and trends affecting mobile game development".</p>

<p>"An individual in this role will spearhead the design and implementation of this platform; work in partnership with internal teams to connect mobile games to PlayStation services; and ensure that all mobile games meet PlayStation's quality standards," the listing states.</p>
<p>Sony has previously dabbled with the mobile gaming market, publishing the likes of the PlayStation app, the PS Remote Play app, endless-runner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/run-sackboy-run-review">Run Sackboy!

In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-fortune-hunter-is-shutting-down">Uncharted: Fortune Hunter was shut down by developer Naughty Dog</a>. While it never specified why it was retiring its mobile spinoff, low player numbers were likely a factor.</p>
<p>
However, it appears the company is still set on reversing its fortunes in the future, with mobile undoubtedly being an important part of the market to crack. </p>

            <p>
Deadlock, the unannounced but previously-leaked hero shooter from Half-Life maker Valve, has been spotted again in a fresh leak. And, this time, we can now see gameplay footage of Deadlock in action.
</p>
<p>
Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock sprung onto the internet last week</a> via images posted to social media and a report from longterm Valve reporter Tyler McVicker, which claimed that Deadlock was currently in closed testing. 
</p>
<p>
It's from this ongoing test that gameplay footage has now also leaked - showing off Deadlock's training mode, more hero characters, and the existence of BioShock Infinite-style skyrails you can hook onto and ride around on.
</p>

<p>
Even Deadlock's setting looks rather BioShock Infinite-like, with period advertising for brands of cigarettes and wide open town squares. 
</p>
<p>
The leaked footage shows off a number of training modes in which the player can acclimitise to the game's controls, test character movement and abilities, and then learn Deadlock's lane system. 
</p>
<p>
Heroes shown include the imp-like winged Ivy, who can slow and stun enemies while buffing allies, dapper fire demon Infernus who can deal fire damage over time, sneaky robot Haze and gothic sniper Vindicta. Several heroes are labelled as "great for new players!", presumably to get newbies started.

</span></p><p>You can watch the leaked footage via the embed above, for now - though Valve has already begun removing links to it.</p>
<p>
Previous reporting suggested Deadlock was Valve's next "major" project, and that it has been in development in one form or other since 2018. There's no word yet on when it'll be formally revealed.
</p>
<p>Deadlock isn't the only game due soon with a BioShock Infinite vibe.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/watch-a-tank-attack-a-medieval-army-in-the-latest-kingmakers-trailer.878118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-trailer-wreak-havoc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Kingmakers is shaping up very nicely, if the latest trailer is anything to go by. In the ‘Wreak Havoc’ trailer, Kingmakers’ destructive capabilities are laid out for all to see, with viewers witnessing a hulking tank smashing effortlessly through medieval buildings from the 13th century. There are shots of a dirtbike-riding soldier blasting through a crowd indiscriminately with an AK-47, and the same character wielding a shotgun and taking down horseback warriors.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kingmakers-is-wild">Kingmakers is Wild</h2>



<p>In our recent interview <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingmakers-interview-ultimate-medieval/">with the developers behind Kingmakers</a>, we learnt that this ambitious title has been dubbed ‘the ultimate medieval fantasy game’. It’s a mix of third-person action and RTS elements, with players assuming control of a character sent back in time to alter history by topping ancient rulers in their stalwart castles.</p>



<p>The latest trailer revealed a little more about how players will accomplish those goals. Mostly, they’ll be wielding modern weaponry and slaying out against waves of medieval soldiers desperately trying to survive with swords, shields, bows, and spears. This new trailer perfectly showcased the most destructive elements of Kingmakers, showing how players can fully collapse a building with a well-placed shot from a grenade launcher, or by driving a main battle tank clean through the side of the thing.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Despite featuring elements that border on the bizarre, Kingmakers is a legitimate title that takes itself seriously, and it has been in development for several years. It doesn’t have a release date, but it’s fast becoming one of the most wanted games on Steam.</p>

MultiVersus beta players will be given a free premium battle pass for the fighting game's first season.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">open beta was shut down until the game's full launch</a>, with no refunds given to players, although progress and content will carry over.

</p>
<p>
Now, in a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">new blog post</a>, developer Player First Games has revealed returning players from the beta will receive access to the season one premium battle pass for free - provided they log in to MultiVersus by 11th June.
</p>

</figure>
<p>

In addition, any returning players will receive a special edition Snow Suit Finn character variant, a special edition Rising Stars ringout, and a special edition Banana Guard announcer pack.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Banana Guard, players who complete the game's new tutorial - a seven-day reward calendar - will receive the character for free. Completing all seven days will add the Lady Banana Guard variant.
</p>
<p>
So what's included in the premium battle pass? The big draw is playable character <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th, revealed earlier this week</a>.

</p>
<p>
Player First Games has increased the number of high-value items in both the free and premium tiers. Premium currency - Gleamium - is available in both tiers, with the premium tier including enough currency to get the next battle pass. Each season of the battle pass will last eight weeks and the final tier will be repeatable for those who reach it early and wish to keep earning rewards.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
It's unknown how much the premium battle pass will cost, though as above it's free for returning players.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the blog post details the four different currencies and how to acquire them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Perk currency - used to unlock in-game perks, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Fighter currency - used to unlock characters, gained through gameplay and the battle pass</li>
<li>Prestige currency - used to unlock exclusive cosmetics, gained by acquiring cosmetics</li>
<li>Gleamium - used to unlock cosmetics, emotes, battle passes and more, gained in events, the battle pass, or direct purchase</li>
</ul>

<p>
Currencies from the beta no longer included here will still be usable. Gold will be swapped for commemorative cosmetics.

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Warner Bros</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
MultiVersus launches on 28th May across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.
</p>
<p>
"Characterful fighters, a good skill ceiling, and a co-op emphasis with real depth makes Warner Bros. MultiVersus a very pleasant surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-review-more-than-just-another-super-smash-bros-clone">Eurogamer MultiVersus open beta review from last year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alongside the previous entries in the series, Kingdom Hearts 4 may release on Nintendo Switch 2, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on X/Twitter, reliable insider Midori discussed the fourth entry in the series, revealing that it may be <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956511435526341" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released on the next Nintendo hardware</a> alongside its predecessors. As only<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-switch-outrageous-prices/"> cloud versions</a> have been released on the original Switch, it would definitely be great to have native ports of the entire series on the upcoming console.</p>
<p>Midori also revealed other <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792956382884278387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1792956382884278387%7Ctwgr%5E27bffc5c203bb2be18bde81cc84daa2b4a49e58f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinalweapon.net%2F2024%2F05%2F21%2Fkingdom-hearts-iv-reportedly-has-online-features-might-come-to-switch-2%2F">interesting tidbits</a> about Kingdom Hearts 4. Apparently, the game, codenamed Quattro (four in Italian), looks very different from the reveal trailer and will have some small online features. More outside IP collaborations are also being planned for the series in the future.</p>
<p>While Midori has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, especially regarding SEGA and Atlus leaks, we have to take what has been revealed on Kingdom Hearts 4 with a grain of salt. With Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth now out, the fourth entry in the series is Square Enix's next major release, so hopefully, we won't have to wait long to see more of it.</p>
<p>The latest main entry in the series is Kingdom Hearts III, now available on PC and consoles. You can learn more about it in Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii-the-end-has-come/">review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Take A Deep Dive Into The First Descendant’s Story]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-a-deep-dive-into-the-first-descendant%E2%80%99s-story.878100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The First Descendant was revealed in 2022, and by today, prospective fans are still waiting for a confirmed release date. It’s expected to drop in 2024, and Nexon is hard at work polishing the highly anticipated title ahead of the impending launch. Recently, Nexon released a deep dive into the game’s story, revealing the key concepts of the setting, outlining some of the game’s lore, and explaining what makes The First Descendant so unique.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-the-first-descendant">Becoming The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant is being pieced together by a South Korean studio, and it has been in development for a few years. It’s poised to be an epic, Unreal Engine 5-driven game that incorporates elements of the looter-shooter genre and traditional RPG titles. In the latest video uploaded to showcase the game, Nexon’s representatives outlined the core concept of The First Descendant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has embraced the destiny left by their predecessors, the ‘Ancestors’, and have become the Descendants. The Vulgus (an alien race) started a war to fulfill the will of their predecessors, the survival of their species. The mission of the Colossi (large beings) cannot be revealed, but they consider it a curse.</p>



<p>The First Descendant’s universe begins with the clash of those who inherited the fate of their predecessors. Whether this tragic fate can be severed in this generation, or will be passed on to the next generation, all depends on the Descendant, who will become the player’s avatar.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a lofty and ambitious concept that has the makings of a fantastic story, but from what we’ve seen so far in terms of gameplay isn’t turning heads too dramatically. In some ways, it looks like a typical third-person shooter that’s even reminiscent of titles like Gears of War at times. In The First Descendant, players will control ‘the ultimate and most powerful tactical force of humanity,’ using a series of unique abilities to overcome some immense enemies, and various play styles and approaches to missions are encouraged.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The First Descendant - Story Deep Dive | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i66htX5ouGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>One gripe that prospective fans have with The First Descendant is that it’s an ‘always online’ game, despite there being solo gameplay elements present in the title. It’s an adventure that can be played cooperatively, but playing solo won’t switch off those always online requirements.</p>

<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s not just Steam that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is coming to, as according to prominent leaker MbKKssTBhz5, a special crossover is also set to arrive in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">When discussing the news that the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will launch on Steam</a> on June 13, MbKKssTBhz5 revealed that they believe a new platform isn’t the only place we’ll see <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> this year, suggesting that not only could it come to Nintendo hardware, but to other games too, specifically mentioning that <em>Fortnite</em> was “part of this initiative.”</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, they don’t have any more information about what it could include or when it could happen, but my mind immediately goes to a Sora character skin, and a Keyblade harvesting tool. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I heard Fortnite was part of this initiative. But I didn’t have any other information on collaboration or date for the collaboration.</p>— みどり (@MbKKssTBhz5) <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1792975164684063118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Of course, the idea of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> makes a ton of sense. <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is all about Disney characters, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-persistent-universe-connected-to-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney now owns a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games</a>. What better way to maximize your revenue than to create a crossover with a property you already control, rather than working with an outside identity on licensing agreements or revenue shares?</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">As for when this crossover could happen, it would make a lot of sense to do it around the release of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> on Steam, but that is just three weeks away, and we would usually see more concrete rumors about a potential crossover by now if that were to be the case. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The other suggestion is that it could be around the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts IV</a></em>, but with it not scheduled to launch until 2025, that seems like a long time to wait. We may get new trailers this year though, which may be a better time to drop some themed cosmetics in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">Remember though, this is a leak and is definitely not confirmed, so make sure to take it with a hefty pinch of salt. In the meantime, we still have a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fallout</em> crossover</a> event to enjoy in <em>Fortnite</em>, so there are plenty of opportunities to spend your V-Bucks in the future. </p>

Smash Bros. fighters have an almost equal chance of winning a match, creator Masahiro Sakurai has said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">Sakurai's YouTube series is still going strong</a>, with his latest video discussing balance in fighting games - something the Smash Bros. games have seen their fair share of controversy around.
</p>
<p>
The video includes win rate data from across the globe, revealing the highest win rate is 51.43 percent and the lowest win rate is 47.18 percent. It means all 87 characters sit within this win/loss ratio, hovering around an equal 50 percent chance of winning.

<p>
Sakurai doesn't reveal which characters are at the top and bottom of this scale - this remains top secret - but, in his words, "any fighter has a shot at winning".
</p>
<p>
As he explains in the video, creating fighters is a balance between uniqueness and competitive balance. Should all characters be too similarly balanced, the game would be boring. "Average and mediocre are the same thing," says Sakurai. Equally, too much uniqueness means "you'll naturally end up with mixed reception".
</p>
<p>
"If you balance purely based on fighter strength, their abilities quickly start to level out," says Sakurai. "Hence, I advise our team to keep fighters unique by amplifying shortcomings to offset advantages."
</p>

<p>
Smash Bros. has certainly been accused of imbalance in the past. GameCube title Melee included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-knight-return-confirmed-for-super-smash-bros-wii-u-and-3ds">Kirby character Meta Knight</a>, who was deemed too powerful and banned from professional tournaments.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, when sassy witch Bayonetta was introduced in Super Smash Bros. on Wii U and 3DS, many found her to be overpowered.
</p>
<p>
Still, Sakurai notes the internet can be "an echo chamber of sorts" that perpetuates opinion. "If people want to prove their point, they're best off settling it in an actual match," he says.
</p>
<p>
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the latest game in the series, released on Switch back in 2018. It's the third highest-selling game on the system, behind Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

            <p>XDefiant, Ubisoft's free-to-play Call of Duty-like arena shooter, launched yesterday. However, the game has already faced its share of issues, with matchmaking being shot (pun not intended) leaving many unable to access it at all.</p>
<p>As users reported being met with an <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865">"Unable to Find Match"</a> alert, Ubisoft acknowledged players were struggling to join a game, stating: "Please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking!"</p>
<p>Things got so bad, developer Mark Rubin - who previously worked on the Call of Duty series prior to his role as XDefiant's executive producer - shared a post on social media last night, showing a hamster clinging on desperately to an out of control wheel. "Matchmaking servers go boom!" he wrote.</p>

<p>Rubin additionally assured his followers that the team was "working on it", and the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1793044381076685170">most recent update over on the XDefiant account</a> is that Ubisoft is "seeing progress on the matchmaking servers".</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated," it said.</p> <div>

<p>XDefiant has walked quite an uneven path to launch. The game was initially revealed as Tom Clancy's XDefiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-ghost-recon-and-the-division-merge-in-ubis-6v6-free-to-play-fps-xdefiant">back in 2021</a>, but Ubisoft later announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-drops-tom-clancys-name-from-xdefiant">dropping the prefix</a> following criticism from Tom Clancy fans. Essentially, the Tom Clancy fanbase felt the XDefiant announcement strayed too far from the franchise's serious military themes and formula.</p>
<p>With the Tom Clancy name dropped, XDefiant went on to have a number of tests, but not always very successfully. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-may-extend-xdefiant-closed-beta-over-horrible-server-experience">one beta was described as having a "horrible" server experience</a> by Rubin himself.</p>
<p>XDefiant then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-due-to-console-certification-issues">missed a planned launch</a> last year due to console certification issues. It subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delays-free-to-play-shooter-xdefiant-again">received another delay</a> in October, this time because of "inconsistencies in the game experience".</p>
