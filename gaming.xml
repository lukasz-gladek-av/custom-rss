            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An ESRB listing has appeared for a game called&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, potentially suggesting that a sequel to the popular PvPvE shooter is in the works.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rating</a>&nbsp;is, as you'd probably expect from a followup to&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, Mature 17+ owing to "blood and gore" and "violence". The listing also warns that the game will contain in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hunt-showdown">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, whatever it turns out to be, will be set in the Victorian era and will revolve around the use of "bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols" to kill both monsters and other players, according to the ESRB.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=_coYu_jv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-swamp.jpg?itok=SBYM1xEA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>may well be getting a sequel soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The listing goes on to describe some pretty grisly things you'll be able to see and do in&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, including "cav[ing] in zombies' heads" and "cut[ting] off their limbs".</p>
<p>According to the ESRB, the game will feature a type of zombie that "explodes into blood and viscera when killed", as well as another one that wears "human skin as a cape". Well, we've all had some pretty extreme Friday nights, no?</p>
<p>I'm not a&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>aficionado, but I'm pretty sure the aforementioned descriptions don't neatly fit any of the game's existing monsters, so&nbsp;<em>1896 </em>could&nbsp;be a followup or a new game rather than an expanded re-release of the original.</p>
<p>Sadly, we haven't had an official announcement from Crytek yet, so we'll have to fall back on speculation and this ESRB rating for now. Hopefully, we'll hear something more in the next few weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=-Pgq7WCV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-spider.jpg?itok=rdu0QTLQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will presumably feature some new monsters.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>will, according to the ESRB page, launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it does arrive, although no release date is listed.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that this is the name Crytek is giving to the current-gen version of&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>, which is due to arrive sometime after the PS4 and Xbox One versions are <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sunsetted in August</a>.</p>
<p>That new version is set to <a href="https://www.crytek.com/news/hunt-showdown-reveals-upgrade-coming-15th-august-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bring an engine change</a>, UI improvements, and a new map to the game, among other things, although Crytek has already announced the relaunch without referring to it as&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>.</p>
<p>It's all to play for right now, so watch this space for any further information from Crytek. Until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown/9ncmq9dxgxf6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hunt-showdown-review-bayou-bounty-blues">take a look at our review here</a> to see how it shakes out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201551/halo-paramount-plus-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has canceled its live-action <em>Halo</em> series for Paramount Plus, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/">according to <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/#"><em>Variety</em></a>. But if you’re a fan of the show and want to see it continue, there’s a sliver of hope: both publications report that the show’s producers are shopping the series around, so perhaps there will be a third season. </p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show premiered <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132662/halo-tv-series-season-1-review-paramount-plus">in 2022</a> and ran for two seasons, with the second <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24063618/halo-season-2-premiere-review-paramount-plus">debuting earlier this year</a>. Pablo Schreiber starred as Master Chief.</p><p>“We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” Paramount said in a statement to <em>THR</em> and <em>Variety</em>. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p><p>The <em>Halo</em> show had its issues, primarily the fact that we never really got to see the titular Halo in any kind of detail. Some fans of the games could never get over the decision to show the Master Chief’s face throughout the majority of the show — something that’s never been done in the games. And some folks were <em>really</em> unamused by the romance subplot between the Chief and a human member of the alien Covenant, which included an unintentionally hilarious sex scene. </p><p>The show’s second season was a vast improvement over the first. The season’s first episode and its later depiction of the Fall of Reach — a major moment in the game series — really captured the harrowing yet valorous essence of the<em> Halo</em> games despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994651/paramount-plus-halo-tv-show-halo-lore">not strictly following the game’s canon</a>. Season 2 also added <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/10/24067616/pablo-schreiber-halo-season-two-paramount-plus">more depth to Schreiber’s Silver Team costars</a>, especially from Riz-028 (Natasha Culzac) and Vannak-134 (Bentley Kalu). The games have done a poor job of capturing the humanity of the people under all that power armor, and that was something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/2/24087962/halo-paramount-plus-episode-five-aleria">the <em>Halo</em> TV series really excelled at</a>, despite all its other faults.</p><p>Hopefully, the showrunners will find a new home for the series to continue what’s been an interesting take on one of the most popular video game series of all time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[PC Motherboard Market Has Seemingly Recovered]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pc-motherboard-market-has-seemingly-recovered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>After three-plus years, it seems as though the PC motherboard market has finally recovered from the shortages 2021 and 2022. </p>



<p>According to information from <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240712PD223/shipments-graphics-card-pc-market-msi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DigiTimes</a>, the motherboard market is on pace to sell 38.8 million units in 2024 from the big four companies — ASUS, ASRock, Gigabyte, and MSI — out of Taiwan. That’s a 5% increase from the 36.8 million shipments from 2023, and a massive 25% increase from the 30.9 million shipments in 2022.</p>



<p>While it’s not going to hit the 42.7 million shipments from 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic was at it’s peak and people were looking for things to do, seeing the jump from 2022 can only be viewed as a win for manufacturers. It also comes alongside a jump in <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-add-in-boards-increase-for-third-quarter-in-a-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPU sales year-over-year</a> that saw a 32% increase as of Q4 2023. </p>



<p>These shipment increases are expected to continue as both AMD and Intel prepare to launch their next-generation CPUs. AMD is set to launch their new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-amd-ryzen-9000-cpus-are-already-at-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryzen 9000 series CPUs</a> later this month. Intel, on the other hand, has its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-next-intel-cpus-have-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrow Lake-S processors</a> coming in the fall.</p>

		<p>The indie hit horror game, The Mortuary Assistant, is coming to console with the expanded and enhanced Definitive Edition release.</p>
<p>The Mortuary Assistant – Definitive Edition will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch on 2nd August 2024. It will also be a free update for the PC version of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Mortuary Assistant - Definitive Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnEMbIsyxiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Launching for PC in 2022, The Mortuary Assistant gained a quick following for all its spooky, haunted vibes – this always goes down well with Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>The game puts you in the role of Rebecca Owens, a graduate in mortuary sciences and new apprentice at River Fields Mortuary, but as if having to work with corpses wasn’t already eerie and unsettling enough, it quickly becomes clear that the mortuary is afflicted by an otherworldly spirit or creature. A phone call from the mortician themself makes it clear that you’re now trapped inside and cannot leave.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of new features and content for the Definitive Edition, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embalming only mode – embalm unlimited bodies</li>
<li>New Haunt Events</li>
<li>Additional Lore</li>
<li>New bodies to embalm</li>
<li>New Valentine’s Day seasonal event (Stop by the mortuary in February)</li>
<li>New achievements</li>
<li>Multiple Bug and Stability Fixes</li>
<li>Performance Improvements</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Atlus has released an official Persona 5 coffee line, so you can set up your own iconic Café Leblanc.
</p>
<p>
In collaboration with Jade City Foods, the coffee line includes three different roasts: the Café Leblanc dark roast, Phantom Thieves of Hearts medium roast, or Shujin Academy light roast.
</p>
<p>
The dark roast offers chocolate and caramel notes, the medium roast has fruity acidity, and the light roast has a cherry and chocolate flavour. All are available as whole beans or ground.
</p>

<p>

Café Leblanc serves as the base of operations for Persona 5's cast of Phantom Thieves, where the protagonist (Joker) can whip up a brew. It's well known for boosting your SP.
</p>
<p>
The café is also known for its curry, so it's fitting that Atlus is also releasing a line of hot sauces alongside the coffee.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
These sauces are - suitably - named after the game's fire spells (Agi, Agilao, Agidyne) as well as the characters Joker, Violet, and Crow. Flavours range from roasted jalapeno, to scotch bonnet, and reaper. 
</p>
<p>
Just be careful with those. As my mother always says, "a tickle on the tongue means a tingle on the bum".
</p>
<p>
All items are available on the <a href="https://jadecityfoods.com/">Jade City Foods website</a>: £15 per sauce, or £16 for a bag of coffee. It's US based but shipping is international. There are also bundles available for multiple items.

</p>
<p>
And if Persona 5 isn't your thing, there are other foods available based on the likes of Naruto, Cuphead, and Ghost in the Shell too.
</p>
<p>
Atlus itself is busy working on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-the-answer-will-release-in-september">Persona 3 DLC Episode Aigis</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-gives-us-a-peek-at-rpg-metaphor-refantazios-story">forthcoming new RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.

            <p>The Mortuary Assistant is finally coming to all consoles on 2nd August, 2024 – two years to the day the influential indie horror hit PC.</p>
<p>Called The Definitive Edition, the base game has been spruced up to include new haunts, bodies, embalming-only mode, and numerous stability and bug fixes.</p>

<p>In The Mortuary Assistant, you take on the role of Rebecca Owens, a newly graduated apprentice at River Fields Mortuary – but the job is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>"Late one night you are called in to handle some embalmings," developer DreadXP teases. "When the Mortician, Raymond, calls the mortuary when you arrive, you soon realise this is a night like none other, and there’s no escape from the demonic forces plaguing the mortuary."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">The Mortuary Assistant is getting the silver screen treatment</a>.</p>
<p>The indie horror - which has been a huge hit since it launched in August 2022 - was reportedly plucked for an adaptation before the full game released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Director Jeremiah Kipp says the film will be a "companion piece" to the game, and Kipp hopes to "retain the minimalist setting in and around the mortuary, the fascination with the process of embalming, and the nerve-shredding terror of the gameplay".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-setting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Very little is currently known about The Elder Scrolls VI, but some recent findings may have provided a rather solid hint regarding the game's setting.</p>
<p>As spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1e6fxao/bethesda_employees_pinterest_account_is_still/#lightbox">Reddit</a> by nitsuaztnarf, an active Pinterest account from a Bethesda Game Studios employee contains a lot of pins for concepts for the upcoming new entry in the series. Judging from these pins, it definitely feels like the game will be set in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-hammerfell-targeting-2025/">Hammerfell</a>, a vast province located in the west of Tamriel, covered by jungles, wooded mountain ranges, subtropical grasslands, swamps, and deserts.</p>
<p>While this could have been a whole lot of nothing, what makes this The Elder Scrolls VI-related finding interesting is how the profile has been mostly pinning fantasy-related images and concepts since the release of Starfield, indicating these have been indeed pinned for the new entry in the series, and the fact that the profile was set to private a few hours after it was shared on Reddit, an attempt to hide something that wasn't supposed to be discovered.</p>
<p>Very little is known about The Elder Scrolls VI. The game was announced in 2018 together with Starfield, but it is still at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-five-years-away/">five years away</a>. According to Todd Howard, it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/"> ultimate fantasy world simulator</a>, so it should be a big step forward compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls VI is currently in development. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration in Fortnite, which was launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier than expected</a>, is now officially underway. Players will receive the v30.20 hotfix for Fortnite today, introducing the content of the Cursed Sails event. This limited-time offering will be live until August 6, 2024; here’s more about the Cursed Sails Pass, Quests and other new content.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-cursed-sails-quests-and-event-pass">Cursed Sails Quests and Event Pass</h2>



<p>Fortnite players will obtain Cursed Sails Quests, which they must complete to earn rewards in the Cursed Sails Pass. Completing Cursed Sails quests will fetch players Cursed Gold. The quests have been divided into eight parts and will go live on alternate days between now and August 2. This Cursed Gold can be used to move through the tiers of the Cursed Sails Pass.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Cursed Sails Pass must be purchased for 1,000 V-Bucks, instantly unlocking the Jack Sparrow Outfit for players with a Fortnite LEGO variant. Other rewards include&nbsp; Jack’s Cutlass and Bane Pickaxe, Skull and Crossed Swords Back Bling, Jack’s Prize Back Bling, Jar of Dirt Emote and seven more unlockable rewards. Finishing all eight parts of the Cursed Sails Quest will unlock Jack’s Ship Glider.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-new-weapons-and-unvaults">New Weapons and Unvaults</h2>



<p>Players will also observe some changes on Fortnite Island during the Cursed Sails event. A new mythic weapon called Ship in a Bottle can be found around Shipwreck Shallows’ pirate ship. Players can open the bottle to summon a cursed ship that can ram through opponents, builds, and the environment. Additionally, Pirate Cannons, the Flint Knock Pistol and other treasures have been unvaulted and can be found across the BR island.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-pirates-of-the-caribbean-hit-the-item-shop">Pirates of the Caribbean Hit the Item Shop </h2>



<p>Elizabeth Swann, Captain Barbossa and Davy Jones have also entered Fortnite Island with Jack Sparrow, with each bundle available for purchase in the Item Shop. The Elizabeth Swann Pack includes the skin, Dead Man’s Chest Back Bling, and the Elizabeth’s Favor Pickaxe. The Captain Barbossa Pack includes the outfit and Barbossa’s Sword Pickaxe. The Davy Jones Pack consists of the skin, Lil Kraken Back Bling, and Norrington’s Sacrifice Pickaxe. Lastly, there’s a Pirates of the Caribbean Bundle, which includes items from all three packs and Davy’s Pipe Organ Emote.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- cache hit 97:single/related:87963907aecae3bbb7e1b88b4075e717 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The FTC says the across-the-board price increases that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">Microsoft recently announced</a> for its Xbox Game Pass subscription service tiers represent "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the merger the FTC has alleged" when it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">sought to block Microsoft's merger with Activision</a>. In <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453/gov.uscourts.ca9.344453.121.0_1.pdf">a letter to the court</a> posted as part of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">an ongoing appeal by the FTC</a> in the case, the federal regulator alleges Microsoft's moves are a clear example of "product degradation" brought about by "a firm exercising market power post-merger."
</p><p>The letter's primary focus is on the soon-to-be-discontinued $10.99/month Console Game Pass tier. That's being replaced with a $14.99/month Game Pass Standard tier (a 36 percent price increase) that no longer includes "day one" access to all of Microsoft's first-party titles. To maintain that key benefit, "Console" subscribers will have to spend 81 percent more for the $19.99 Game Pass Ultimate tier, which also includes a number of additional benefits over the current $10.99/month option.</p>
<h2>Is this “based on the acquisition”?</h2>
<p>The FTC notes that these changes "coincide with adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass’s most expensive tier." Previously, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/sony-calls-microsofts-3-year-call-of-duty-sharing-offer-inadequate/">Microsoft publicly promised</a> that this Game Pass access to Activision's ultra-popular shooter would come "with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>It's that "based on the acquisition" clause that's likely to give Microsoft some wiggle room in arguing for its planned pricing changes. Inflation is also a sufficient explanation for a large portion of the price increase in nominal terms—the $14.99 Microsoft charged for a month of Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18296816/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-pricing-release-date-rumors">when it launched in 2019</a> is the equivalent of $18.39 today, according to <a href="https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=14.99&amp;year1=201906&amp;year2=202406">the BLS CPI calculator</a>. When Microsoft raised the Game Pass Ultimate monthly price from $14.99 to $16.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">just last year</a>—just before the Activision merger was finalized—the company said in a statement it had "adjusted the prices to reflect the competitive conditions in each market."</p>
<p>Microsoft might have a harder time finessing the alleged "degradation" inherent in going from the discontinued Game Pass Console tier to the new, more expensive Game Pass Standard tier. True, the replacement does include the online multiplayer benefits of Game Pass Core, which could previously be purchased separately. But the removal of the long-promised day one access to first party games will heavily reduce the value most subscribers get from the new option.</p>
<p>It's now been over a year since the FTC <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/ftc-appeal-in-microsoft-activision-case-shows-us-regulator-isnt-giving-up-yet/">first announced it intended to appeal</a> the ruling that effectively stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/report-ftc-will-file-to-block-microsofts-69b-activision-blizzard-acquisition/">its attempted injunction</a> against the merger deal. While Microsoft and Activision have moved forward with their merger since then, courts <a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/ftc-wins-reversal-in-whole-foods">have reversed similar mergers on appeal</a> even after a merger deal has fully closed.
</p><p>Elsewhere in its letter, the FTC makes note of previous arguments that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Microsoft's recent round of nearly 2,000 Xbox-focused layoffs</a> is a sign of "reduced investments in output and product quality" post-merger.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> Grand Festival, a final Splatfest for their ink-splatting online shooter that will take place in September and run for an extended 72-hour period.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splatoon 3 – Grand Festival is coming! (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TAZohLilNjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beginning on 13th September and running for three straight days:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start date &amp; time</strong> – Friday 13th September 1AM UK time</li>
<li><strong>End date &amp; time</strong> – Monday 16th September 00:59AM UK time</li>
</ul>
<p>The Grand Festival is the biggest ever Splatfest that the series has featured, and from the announcement trailer, it absolutely leans into that with a grand music festival taking place with all the music acts from the series to date dancing and singing on stage to a huge crowd.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s really all about the battling, and the three-way question that the Grand Festival will ask is: What is the most important to you? Past, Present or Future?</p>

<p>In a twist to the usual Splatfest questions, it’s the idol groups that will represent the three themes. The past is the Squid Sisters, the present is Off the Hook, and the future is Deep Cut.</p>
<p>The deep suspicion is that, as with the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2, the community-driven answer to this question will determine the future of the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/09/splatoon-2-final-splatfest-july-order-chaos/">Splatoon 2’s finale asked players to choose between order and chaos</a>, and with chaos winning, Splatoon 3 moved the story to a rather desolate new location of Splatsville, AKA the “City of Chaos”. If past or future win, we could see a potential Splatoon 4 go in some really wild new directions.</p>
<p>To mark the moment, Nintendo is also releasing <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1814212474263994518">two new sets of Splatoon amiibo</a> on 5th September: the Side Order Set featuring Pearl &amp; Marina, and the Alterna Set with recoloured Callie &amp; Marie.</p>
<p>It will be bittersweet to say goodbye to these regular events for the Splatoon community, and I admittedly regret not playing enough of the game in the past couple years, as good as the game is.&nbsp;For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

<p>The Shackling Prison is a "formidable facility" whose entrance lies hidden beneath the water's surface. It's where Xueyi and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-reveals-new-playable-character-hanya">Hanya</a> carry out their duties, and it's also the home of many of the realm's most notorious criminals, not to mention wolflike monsters known as the Borisin.</p>

<p>The second new character in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 2.4 is Jiaoqiu, a Fire-type foxian healer following the Path of Nihility. His attacks have a chance to burn enemies, and his ultimate exacerbates the effects of his regular attacks' burn.</p>

<p>HoYoverse has also announced a collaboration with the anime&nbsp;<em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>, which is due to debut some time in the third quarter of 2025.</p>

Ubisoft is sweetening this transition by offering up to 50% off the game, though double-check that price and edition before buying.</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason for the free trial is because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-sky-breaker-dlc-continues-the-story-in-july/1100-6524137/" data-ref-id="1100-6524137">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora just received The Skybreaker DLC</a> earlier this week, which picks up the story from the end of the base game.

Ubisoft, for its part, has said it's looking forward to GTA VI's release because when a game as big as GTA VI comes out, it helps the market overall.</p><p>"What we see, generally, when GTA is coming, is that more people come to play. So generally it's positive on the overall market," CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/atyzrozr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said during Ubisoft's latest earnings call</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Guillemot went on to say that historical trends for Ubisoft's business bear this out. He said Ubisoft's games enjoyed "very good sales" around the time that GTA V came out in 2013, while its titles also performed well when the GTA V re-release for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launched in March 2022.</p><p>"It is something that is counter-intuitive but is working for us in general," Guillemot said.</p><p>The company went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag/" data-ref-id="5000-172624">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a>, which was released a month after GTA V in 2013, enjoyed record sales for the series at the time. Ubisoft's overall philosophy is to focus on delivering high-quality game experiences even when the competition is strong, the company said.</p><p>Ubisoft has not, however, announced its full game release pipeline for 2025, so it's too soon to say what Ubisoft game might be competing with GTA VI. The game is set for release during Fall 2025, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past decade has been delayed</a> so there is a chance this happens again with GTA VI.</p>

		<p>Mr. Blue Sky is out and about as we head into the weekend, so I’ve got fans pushing air around to try and keep the house cool enough to consider making more heat with consoles and PC gaming. Thankfully I’m not playing the most graphically intensive games, continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 and dabbling with a few other things that you’ll hear about soon…</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> reported in first to say that he’s played a pretty smorgasbord of The Lord of the Rings The Third Age, Neverwinter Nights 2, Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, and The Last of Us Part 2. That’s a lot of fantasy and gritty battling!</p>

<p>Even more varied and in very different ways was <strong>Aran’s</strong> week, which featured a preview for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/ea-sports-fc-25-preview-what-a-rush/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which is “more of the same, but Rush is fantastic”, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">TMNT: Splintered Fate</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/rack-and-slay-review/">Rack and Slay</a> for review – a decent Hades clone and a billiards-bashing roguelike respectively. For his own enjoyment, he bored himself with The Turing Test, continued picking up collectibles in AC Mirage, and has started to replay&nbsp;Enslaved Odyssey to The West, “which is just as good as I remember.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> beat Skyrim for the very first time, after more than a decade of varying attempts, but he’s tempted to go back in to complete some of the side quests. That’s bumped Cyberpunk 2077 to the top of his playlist, where he’s kept chipping away at the story, and in search of something different to play on Steam Deck, he’s started Dragon Quest XI and is eyeing up Fallout: New Vegas.</p>


<p>It was the “excellent but traumatic” Conscript for <strong>Steve</strong>, a survival horror game where surviving is just as horrific as not. He countered that with the review of the bitesized speedrunning delights of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. He also had his Retroid Pocket out to play the “underrated” Breath of Fire series, and is preparing to play Flintlock off Game Pass.</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, of course, but he’s also been reviewing Thank Goodness You’re Here!, which you’ll hear more about later this month, and stomping deeper into RoboCop: Rogue City – “It’s <em>exactly</em> what a RoboCop game should be like. It’s slow, clunky, and plays like something from the 80’s, but also makes you feel like RoboCop with his thundering pistol that literally minces punks.”</p>

<p><strong>Reu</strong> has been rampaging through everything that Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail to wrap up our review of the game, which you’ll get to see very soon, and we’ll rounding things out with <strong>Dom</strong> for this week. He’s been a busy little bee jumping between shadows for our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/15/schim-review/">SCHiM</a> review, as well as working towards reviews of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which he’s been playing quite “merrily” and Hot Lap Racing.</p>
<p>And with that, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>VA-11 Hall-A&nbsp;</em>developer Sukeban Games has released the debut trailer for its newest project&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>, and it looks exactly as strange and wonderful as you'd expect.</p>
<p><em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>was first unveiled by Sukeban Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/45-parabellum-bloodhound-sukeban-games">earlier this month</a>, with the developer unveiling the project alongside a host of GIFs and images showing off its aesthetic.</p>
<p>Now, however, the first trailer for the game has been revealed, giving us a glimpse of a game that looks like it's inspired not only by Square Enix's classic survival horror-RPG&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve</em>, but also by Suda51's cult hit&nbsp;<em>Killer7</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-slums.jpg?itok=V9-i_JST 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/45-parabellum-bloodhound-trailer-slums.jpg?itok=apEKW_o3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>has those immaculate PS1 vibes.</figcaption></figure><p>The new trailer shows a game with stylish PS1-style graphics and an art style reminiscent of an edgy '90s anime (in the best possible way, of course).</p>
<p>We also get to see a glimpse of the combat, which, in keeping with the game's "Active Time Action" tagline, seems heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Parasite Eve&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vagrant Story</em>.</p>
<p>It's all soundtracked by music that put me in mind of the likes of&nbsp;<em>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron</em>, or perhaps the work of&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>'s Keiichi Okabe. In short, this is one you're going to want to play if, like me, you're unashamedly and constantly drowning in PS1 nostalgia.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em>below. If it doesn't make you want to play the game, just watch it again until it does!</p>

<p>Sadly, we don't have any kind of release date or window for&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound</em>; back when it was announced, Sukeban said it would be finished when it was ready, so it might be a while before we get to play this one.</p>
<p>It's also the project on which Sukeban has chosen to focus its energies, which means that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/n1rv-ann-release-date-delayed-indefinitely"><em>N1RV Ann-A&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for</a> is probably not going to materialize anytime soon, either.</p>
<p>We'll bring you more on this one as soon as we get it. In the meantime, you can wishlist&nbsp;<em>.45 Parabellum Bloodhound&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014650/45_PARABELLUM_BLOODHOUND__Cyberpunk_Active_Time_Action/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flintlock-siege-of-dawn-review">Edwin’s been appreciating</a> the acrobatic twist that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a> puts on the Soulslite formula, but not everybody’s magical zip-zooping has been going as smoothly. Following the Steam and PC Game Pass releases yesterday, there are widespread reports of heavy stuttering spoiling the fun; I’ve given both versions a test, and indeed, Flintlock does have a serious case of the framerate stammers. Especially the Game Pass build, which is <em>significantly</em> worse for it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Steam version sees occasional hitching, usually when you and your god-fox mate enter a new area for the first time. Classic shader compilation stutter, looks like. On Game Pass, though, performance can also hiccup on attacks, dodges, and double-jumps, more keenly impacting the game’s flow. That’s all on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> with the game running at 1080p, by the by, so well above Flintlock’s recommended settings.</p>
<p>What’s to be done? A <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1832040/discussions/0/4518882879955578724/">pinned thread</a> on the game’s Steam forums suggest any of three remedies: disabling Nvidia Reflex, updating your graphics drivers, and "selecting different Super Sampling options", these being upscalers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/confirmed-ray-tracing-and-dlss-games">DLSS</a>. The latter will raise average framerates versus native-rez rendering, which might at least hide the stutters a bit better, though I was playing on the very latest GeForce drivers and was still stuttering on an all-too-regular basis. Of the three fixes, the one I had the most unqualified success with was disabling Nvidia Reflex, meaning Flintlock gets to join <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> in the Games That Allow Input Latency Reducers To Hurt Performance Somehow club. Hopefully the former can find a fix <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-horizon-forbidden-west-pc-patch-finally-fixes-its-weirdest-issue">like the latter did</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20240716150122_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kepler Interactive / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also – and this is just from my own testing on a single GPU, so your results may vary – I found that reducing Shadow Quality can both soothe the stuttering and deliver a huge boost to performance in general. Starting with Ultra quality, my PC was averaging 55-60fps in most areas, which lept to a mostly wobble-free 90-100fps with shadows on Medium. Consider giving that a go, before cutting back on upscaling quality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not a new problem, even for Flintlock specifically – the action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s June demo was prone to shuddering as well. And as for why the Game Pass version performs worse than Steam’s, this is at least partly explained by the fact that they are literally different versions, owing to Microsoft’s policy of forcing all games available on the Xbox app to go through their own certification process. This can hold up performance patches, and in extreme cases even lead to PC games lacking entire features in their Game Pass build – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-update-fixes-blackscreen-and-controller-bugs-but-multiplayer-issues-persist-on-game-pass">recent, though no less silly, example</a>.</p>
