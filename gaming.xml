            <p>
Free-to-play tactical extraction shooter Arena Breakout: Infinite will launch into early access next week on 13th August.
</p>
<p>
Early access will be available on PC exclusively via the <a href="https://www.arenabreakoutinfinite.com/en/index.html">game's official website</a>, following a closed beta test earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
During early access, developer MoreFun Studios will focus on optimisation, introduce new features, and adjust gameplay and monetisation systems, and aims to quickly iterate on player feedback.

<p>
This early access version of the military shooter includes a new Armory map, multiple weapons and gear, features such as Kill Cam and Spectate, plus support for four languages and lowered hardware requirements down to GTX 960.
</p>
<p>
"During the Closed Beta Test (CBT) earlier this year for Arena Breakout: Infinite, our team constantly improved the game, addressing bugs and adding new features," said Enzo Zhang, head of MoreFun Studios and producer of Arena Breakout: Infinite. 
</p>
<p>
"From our CBT learnings, we felt the best way to streamline and structure early access development was through our own official website. We feel this is the best and most collaborative development approach as we use this early access period to quickly deliver the most complete 1.0 version of Arena Breakout: Infinite on PC."
</p>
<p>
Pre-downloads for early access will begin a day early on 12th August. Information regarding Steam early access and the full 1.0 launch will be detailed at Gamescom later this month.
</p>
<p>The Steam release will certainly be important as the game is currently high on the platform's most wishlisted list.</p>
<p>
Arena Breakout: Infinite will be a direct competitor to the popular Escape from Tarkov. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, that game's developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-u-turns-on-decision-to-lock-exclusive-pve-mode-to-a-special-edition-following-blacklash">Battlestate u-turned on a controversial special edition of Escape from Tarkov</a> players criticised as pay-to-win.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaling-will-make-it-feel-like-100-faster-than-base-model-will-allow-some-games-to-go-from-medium-to-epic-settings.946638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the CPU and RAM not seeing much of an improvement over the base model's, the PlayStation 5 Pro will feel like a 100% more powerful than ther regular PS5 thanks to upscaling.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead"> Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells discussed the yet-to-be-revealed mid-generation refresh system, and how its power and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler will improve games. Talking specifically about the studio's games, the console could allow them to activate ray tracing if the game already manages to run at 60 FPS on the base model without ray tracing. Regarding resolution, the console's additional power will allow games to be a little less blurry than on the base model, but it won't solve the issue entirely, and upscaling will continue to play a big role in the grand scheme of things, as game engines like the Unreal Engine 5 aren't getting any faster and will continue to need upscaling. PSSR, however, will make the PlayStation 5 Pro actually feel like 100% more powerful than the base models to developer, split between 50% of actual improvements and the other 50% brought by upscaling.</p>
<p>Discussing the PlayStation 5 Pro leaked specs further, the Alderon Games founder feels that the aforementioned limited CPU and RAM improvements aren't going to be a massive problem, as the vast majority of console games aren't CPU-bottlenecked, and scaling up RAM is usually among the hardest thing to do as most developers optimize according to the available RAM, and only some of the biggest games with the biggest development team would be able to take advantage of additional amount. The GPU improvements, on the other hand, may allow some games to run with the equivalent of epic settings instead of the medium settings usually used for the base model. The additional power may make it easier for developers to implement 120Hz modes with further tweaking of the graphics settings.</p>

            <p>
A hotfix for Fallout: London to address crashing issues is still on the way, with developer Team Folon planning a "huge" patch soon after.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">game-size fan-made mod for Fallout 4 set in the English capital</a> released at the end of July, but players have experienced a high number of crashes and issues, including Eurogamer's Ian Higton when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">streamed his playthrough</a>.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon promised a fix was on the way</a> and, in a new statement on its Discord, has reiterated its plans for the future.

<p>
"We are absolutely blown away by the incredible support from the community for our mod. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us!" reads the announcement.
</p>
<p>
"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix. This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4', which will be merged into the mod itself. We've also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help. Additionally, we'll be explaining certain features we added that might not have been as useful as we thought, so stay tuned for those details.
</p>
<p>
"The future is bright! We're already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.
</p>
<p>
"So, the plan is: hotfix first to stop and help with the crashes, then a big patch after."
</p>
<p>
For now, the team is still offering one-on-one troubleshooting sessions for anyone struggling to get the mod running.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Team Folon will be streaming a developer playthrough on Thursday 8th August (tomorrow) at 8pm UK time over on its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/teamfolon">Twitch channel</a>, offering a look at the development process.

</p>
<p>
A reminder, too, that players will need to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">downgrade Fallout 4's next-gen version</a> to get the mod running.

<p>In a tweet’s comment section, Colantonio was questioned about the potential presentation of the game at Gamescom. In response, Colantonio clarified that the game will be showcased to industry partners and publishers, with no public or press unveiling plans yet. Additionally, Colantonio specified that the discussion pertained to the Prey that was launched in 2017.</p>

            <p>My own experience with gambling doesn't extend much beyond the single time I won a few dollars at a Vegas slot machine then refused to play again so I could claim that I'd "beaten Vegas." My own very petty victory as the <strong>ultimate gambler</strong> aside, it's by and large an industry built on preying on the vulnerable, so it's no surprise that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> developer LocalThunk is so dead against ever seeing his poker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> used for evil that he's made a specific stipulation in his will.</p>

<p>"I hate the thought of Balatro becoming a true gambling game so much that when I recently created my will I stipulated that the Balatro IP may never be sold or licensed to any gambling company/Casino," <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">Twxngled LocalThunk recently</a>, in response to a jokey "conspiracy theory" post by another user that Balatro was secretly a psyop to get kids into casinos.</p>
<p>Back in March, Balatro was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-like-poker-hit-balatro-pulled-from-sale-in-some-countries-due-to-unexpected-ratings-change">temporarily taken down</a> from digital console storefronts after European ratings board PEGI changed the age rating from 3+ to 18+ after deciding the game encouraged gambling with "prominent imagery".</p>
<p>"I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," LocalThunk said in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bdtmlg/ama_i_am_localthunk_developer_and_artist_for/">Reddit AMA at the time</a>. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>One reply to LocalThunk's tweet about the will was from Purple Moss Collectors, the developers of the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a>, who asked LocalThunk to pass on the wording used so they could do the same. I've already seen D&amp;DG described as "Balatro but Blackjack" which is understandable at this point, and there's a good chance this was one of the Balatro "imitators" referenced in the original tweet LocalThunk responded to. As LocalThunk has pointed out, though, <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1819108453102883151">D&amp;DG went public before Balatro</a> - an early version has been <a href="https://purplemosscollectors.itch.io/dndg">kicking around on Itch</a> for over a year now. Either way, it's a lovely show of support.</p>
<p>"It reels you back in not to exploit psychological weakness, but to celebrate the inherent joy of learning, mastering and beating a system gamed around impossible odds," wrote Katharine (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">her Balatro review</a>. And nothing could sum up the fundamental difference at the heart of games like this to actual gambling better, I think, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meeting-the-people-of-pegi-talking-age-ratings-gambling-and-why-their-famous-voice-only-got-200">if PEGI bizarrely disagree.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-this-is-just-a-death-cycle-no-more-robots-gets-candid-about-the-state-of-indie-publishing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">No More Robots, the UK-based indie publisher founded by Mike Rose, has found plenty of success over the years. Since forming in 2017, the company has brought a litany of titles to market including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Not Tonight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yes, Your Grace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hypnospace Outlaw</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Let's Build a Zoo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spirittea</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Descenders</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latter was the first project signed by the publisher and remains one of its most successful, attracting a feverishly loyal community after filling a gap in the extreme sports market when it launched in 2018. Now, it's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CaveESUCdA">finally getting a sequel in </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CaveESUCdA">Descenders Next</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which aims to be the definitive downhill racer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For No More Robots and founder Rose, the reveal of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Descenders Next</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> represents something of a milestone moment. A chance to reflect on how much has changed since the publisher took its first steps seven years ago. How has the business evolved since then? Well, Rose claims it's pretty much "fucked."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An implosion is coming, so batten down the hatches">An implosion is coming, so batten down the hatches</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a rather blunt appraisal, but with layoffs carving through the industry while both studios and publishers drop like flies, you might struggle to find anybody who'd argue. Rose explains there are some top level reasons for the downturn. The pandemic sales boom resulting from lockdowns. The subsequent over-investments and growth projections that never came good. The economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The rampant M&amp;A wave that saw numerous studios and publishers swallowed by yawning conglomerates. The misguided belief that IPOs somehow represent the promised land.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose suggests it's a recipe that can only lead to one thing: a market implosion. But is there anything publishers can do to survive? Perhaps.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For starters, he says it's time to admit that platform holders are no longer serving the interests of smaller publishers. "The problem with the new situation is that everything that I did when No More Robots started—you know, getting cheeky [Xbox Game Pass] deals and making it onto the Stream front page—isn't available any more," he says. "None of that is available anymore. When the Steam Summer Sale happens, it's absolutely triple-A all the way down that have paid for those slots. It used to be the Summer Sale would make us a year of burn rate, and now it's a nice little spike."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose says indies have been sidelined on Steam after Microsoft, Sony, EA and other major players chose to bring titles that might previously have been console exclusives onto PC. "Steam is making more money," he says, "but like 50 percent of that revenue is being generated by 1 percent of the games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose feels part of the solution is to seriously mitigate the risks you're taking on as a publisher. Consider the long-term without fixating on exponential growth. He says more companies need to accept that success in video games doesn't need to be synonymous with rapid expansion and chart-topping hits, but rather pragmatic survival.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After 2022 when everything seemed fucked, we just stopped signing things," he explains. "For a long time we just stopped signing things because I was like 'this is a death cycle.' What we need to do is get better at making more money out of the back-catalogue we've got. And we have done that. In the last two years we've got into an amazing cycle, where as cynical as it sounds, we've squeezed every penny out of the games we've got.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So the games we had already are making more money than before because we had a big focus on that. But earlier this year, when everyone started to close down, I started to realize that if we keep doing that eventually it's not going to go well. If we have no games, then what happens? Our new plan essentially is to sign a bunch of new stuff [...] but they're all very cheap and quick, out-of-the-door projects."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose explains those projects were signed on the basis they'll take months, not years, to develop. It also means shorter timeframes between reveal and release, perhaps giving them a greater chance of taking root in the consumer consciousness. "I've signed five new things in the last few months and the plan is they are all going to come out within the next year, and the hope is they'll all recoup very quickly," he adds. "Then if a couple of them really pop off, then we'll say cool 'let's stick that on Switch or see if Game Pass wants in.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's an approach that might not deliver a sales "explosion," but that's precisely the point. In signing lower risk projects, No More Robots doesn't need to swing for a home run each time it goes to bat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Pitching to publishers? You'd better be &quot;cheap as fuck or expensive as hell&quot;">Pitching to publishers? You'd better be "cheap as fuck or expensive as hell"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're thinking this all sounds a little pessimistic, Rose is right there with you. Maybe, though, there's room for a little more cynicism if it can help save an industry that so often tries to run before it can walk. "I quite often feel like I'm this old, whiney, white man," he says. "That's what I think people see me as—and I am. But with good fucking reason. Last year, a number of press sites reached out like 'Hi Mike, we're doing our end of year roundup and seeing what publishers thing is going to happen in 2024. We're hearing lots of positive things.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I emailed back saying 'I don't know who you're hearing that from but they're unbelievably wrong. Next year is going to be worse. There's nothing to say otherwise, and now obviously we've seen how this year is going. People saying 'survive to 2025' makes me sad because they think it's going to be better. I understand what the whole point of optimism is, and maybe I'm going to cut years off my life being a pessimist, but I also have a sustainable business because of my pessimism."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose says there have been multiple points when No More Robots could have gone crazy. People were telling him to hire "fucking loads of people" after the publisher delivered some hits. But he was sure the good times wouldn't last, and suggests he would have been a "fucking idiot" to believe No More Robots had somehow become invincible. Success isn't permanent. It's a drum he keeps banging, but it has become key to No More Robots' survival.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where does this leave developers? Rose says there are currently two types of games you can pitch publishers: "either cheap as fuck or expensive as hell." Anything in the middle is getting knocked back. "There are publishers who will take low risk, cheap games, like ourselves," he continues. "But there are publishers. Companies like Devolver for example—I don't know what numbers they're looking for, but it's going to be ridiculous numbers. [...] If they sign like a middling game for $400,000 or something, it looks weak. It looks like they're signing a small game. But $400,000 is too much for me."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rose still needs to connect with a pitch on a personal level, but explains it's vital that developers can understand and effectively communicate their needs. "Sometimes they're asking for too little money. They'll say 'it'll take X amount of time but it's only going to cost this because we'll live cheap,'" he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels another myth that traps developers is the notion that more time in development will equal more sales. "It's not true. It's just not true. And if anything, now you're seeing—especially on the visual side—that players give less and less of a fuck whether a game is gorgeous or not," he adds. "At this point, I feel like after you've been making a game for a year, the stuff you're adding at that point is not coming back on you. That's hard because there'll be certain types of games then that just can't be made, but unfortunately, right now, that's the way it is."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Sega's acquisition of Angry Birds maker Rovio has helped boost the company's video game profits by 181.5 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
According to its latest financial report, Sega's net sales for video games increased by 34 percent, leading to a huge rise in profits.
</p>
<p>
It attributes this increase in part to the inclusion of Rovio, along with the release of Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance in the most recent quarter.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">Sega acquired Rovio last year for £625m</a>, which was completed by last August. A year-on-year comparison for this quarter, then, is favourable.

</p>
<p>
Shin Megami Tensei V Vengeance released on 14th June across PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One, following its initial release on Switch in 2021. It sold 500,000 copies in its first three days of release worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Other successes include sales of older releases ("repeat titles" as Sega calls them) like Unicorn Overlord (which released earlier this year) and the remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-royal-review">Persona 5 Royal</a>.
</p>
<p>
In addition, revenue from the Sonic movie and animation were strong.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the year looks to be positive for Sega too, with the release of Atlus's next RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-has-over-40-archetypes-heres-how-they-work-in-battle">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> on 11th October, Sonic x Shadow Generations on 25th October, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-25-to-remove-inbox-ability-to-hammer-demand-more-whenever-youre-losing">Football Manager 25</a> (currently without an exact release date).
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-reportedly-casts-keanu-reeves-as-shadow">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> will also be released later this year on 20th December, which will likely result in a further revenue boost.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with Sonic x Shadow Generations earlier this year</a> and revelled in its big dash of nostalgia.

<p>It’s been a wild ride for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 these past few days, and Insider Gaming has learned that hundreds of people are playing the game ahead of its official release.</p>



<p>When the leaks first began, it was assumed that only a few select people had access, but as word has spread, that list of people has grown into the hundreds. People are accessing Black Ops 6 via bricked PlayStation 4 consoles (all leaked footage is from the PlayStation 4), with access to the game seemingly being the BETA version that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public will get to play at the end of August</a>.</p>



<p>One Discord server sent to us yesterday had over one hundred people playing when the screenshot was taken before the server was taken offline to fix bugs; it is understood to have been caused by the new BETA update. That issue has since been fixed, and people are playing the game again.</p>



<p>What’s particularly interesting is that people are seemingly not just playing against bots, either; instead, there are full lobbies of people playing against one another.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Activision will or can stop people from playing Black Ops 6, but for now, the company has resorted to DMCA takedowns of the content posted online.</p>



<p>One developer told me about the situation, “It really sucks to see our big reveal ruined like this, we were all excited to show it off in a big and special way.” Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>



<p>What do you think of the current situation with Black Ops 6 and the leaks online? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 console is continuing to sell rather well, but the pace of sales is slowing down faster than anticipated.</p>
<p>In today's financial report for the first quarter of FY24, the Japanese company confirmed 2.4 million units were sold during the quarter, below the 3 million units that analysts had expected, bringing the total number of sold units to 61.7 million units. Despite the excellent number of units sold, the current generation console seems to be trailing behind its predecessor, as the PlayStation 4 sold 63.5 million units in a similar time frame.</p>

<p>According to Morning Star Investment director Kazunori Ito, as reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-07/sony-raises-full-year-outlook-after-earnings-beat-estimates?srnd=undefined&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, however, the PlayStation business is not doing as well as the numbers suggest because profits and revenue were inflated by the weak yen. Sony was expecting that sales would slow down this fiscal year, but they are slowing faster than they had anticipated. With the lack of big first-party releases, that was to be expected.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will turn things around and how much of a difference it will make. According to rumors, the system should be revealed next month for a late 2024 launch, but without any big first-party game launching for some time, the system will need to be rather impressive for players to upgrade their base PS5 systems without any sort of killer application.</p>

<p>Fallout London, the highly ambitious mod project, has been live for almost two weeks, but crashes and other bugs are still significant. Fortunately, according to the latest announcement by the Fallout London devs, a big patch is on the way to remedy the situation, and before that, players will receive a hotfix, too.</p>



<p>As per Fallout London’s official Discord, the upcoming hotfix will address crashes and include essential systems like ‘Buffout 4’. The hotfix will also help fix several other issues before the ‘big patch’ arrives. Fallout London’s big patch will focus mainly on the problems reported in their Discord channel and “a multitude of quest-related and other problems”.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moreover, if players are still having trouble running the mod, they can queue up for dedicated 1-on-1 troubleshooting sessions, where one of the Fallout: London devs will personally address their issues and guide them through getting the mod running on their system. All players need to do is head over to their official <a href="https://discord.gg/GtmKaR8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> and join the waiting room for Troubleshooting sessions, and someone will reach out to them with help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, their announcement post also stated that a Fallout London developer play-through stream is scheduled for Thursday, August 8. Interested players can tune into Team Folon’s official Twitch channel at 8 PM UK time to speak to devs and learn about the “behind-the-scenes info about the development process.”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> bods Creative Assembly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/colossal-squigs-all-but-confirmed-for-next-total-war-warhammer-3-dlc-plus-big-new-toys-for-ogres-and-khorne">put out a chunky</a>, chatty video discussing the next expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a>. Aside from a not-so-subtle hint that the orcs, ogres, and Khorne pack would feature at least one colossal squig, it also ended with a tease at smaller bits of new content coming alongside regular patches. As of the game’s<a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/forums/7-patch-notes-amp-announcements/threads/6498-total-war-warhammer-iii-hotfix-5-1-3"> latest hotfix blog</a>, we’ve now got a better idea when we’ll start seeing some of these “smaller bits and pieces.” Bits <em>and</em> pieces? In this economy? Yes, and this month in fact. “Late August” to be precise by quoting a vague statement precisely.</p>

<p>Whether this is all just bluster meant to keep the perpetually orc-pilled masses (me) sated until the DLC, I can’t be certain. I’d put the chances at three goblins balanced on each other’s shoulders so they can reach the Weetabix on top of the fridge out of five. Still, the fact they’ve called attention to it seems significant, and there’ll be a fresh new blog from design director Mitchell Heastie “in the coming weeks” to discuss exactly what the new patch will entail. You don’t Release The Heast for nothing! Or, maybe you do. It’s my first time encountering his name, honestly.</p>
<p>Either way, we’ve at least got some hotfix notes to keep us sated until then. There’s several dozen items on the list, although my attention was immediately drawn to the list of units that were “not displaying stumps when dismembered”. Now, we can adequately maim Nasty Skulkers, Amethyst Wizards, and several others.</p>
<p>Legendary Red Crested Skink Chief Lords now correctly have the immortal skill - another classic Skink win. Karl Franz can now confederate Balthasar Gelt. A bug where “the Herald of Slaanesh's leg rotates strangely during an idle animation when on a steed” is now fixed, thank goodness. There’s a load more, most of them very specific to certain units, and all of which I’m sure we’ll make at least one person very happy.</p>
<p>As for the next DLC, the release date is still up in the air, although seeing something before the year’s out seems extremely likely. Creative Assembly have recently reaffirmed their commitment to Total War after a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">disastrous streak</a>. Since then, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mesopotamia-is-coming-to-total-war-pharaoh-alongside-over-80-new-units">a massive free update</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-pharaoh">Total War: Pharaoh</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">even heard rumours</a> of Total War: Star Wars. Back in June, a former developer put out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design">lengthy personal statement alleging a culture of mismanagement at the studio</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, before I forget: a few of you asked me about writing something for people that want to get into Total War: Warhammer but, understandably, aren’t sure where to start. That sounded like a good idea to me, so I went and wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-absolute-beginners-guide-to-getting-started-with-total-war-warhammer-and-immortal-empires">a massive guide</a> covering everything from gameplay to DLC purchases. Hope it’s useful! Also: please do not play this game. It will ruin you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They initially received one month's salary and then the problems began. "In my case [the missed wages] started from the second month. Pretty much I was only paid for the month of October," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foretold leadership approached Allakhverdiev at that stage to explain the studio was struggling financially, but seemed optimistic about the prospect of securing additional funding. Given he had financial buffers in place, Allakhverdiev agreed to forgo some wages in the hope other employees would be paid. He never received a full wage payment again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That decision was mine and I do not regret it, but I wasn't expecting the financial situation to go on that long," he said. "The situation got so bad financially that one of the people in the company had to take a loan, and this was when I started to be upset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As an indie company, it was not [entirely] surprising as there are some challenging&nbsp;launches for small games and thus I was not personally alarmed. Then around the third month [of my employment] we were supposed to have a big investment drop in. Unfortunately, it never came and we pretty much got nothing until I left."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Foretold management turned the studio into a driverless car">Foretold management turned the studio into a driverless car</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Allakhverdiev said there was a sense that Foretold, under the management of CEO Michael Kuvshynov, was akin to a driverless car. Although he doesn't feel there was any "malicious intent" from leadership, he said Kuvshynov failed to effectively communicate with staff as to why wages were going unpaid and how the matter would be resolved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This became a huge issue internally," said Allakhverdiev. "No one was ready for the financial crisis that happened [almost] immediately as we all started working. After we started to have the [wage] issues we tried to stay positive but the more it was going [on], the more everyone's morale was sinking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What saddens me is that if we had the proper funds from the beginning, everything would have been fine and there would have been no management problems due to stress, no people leaving, and an amazing game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite his belief that Kuvshynov didn't set out to mislead workers, Allakhverdiev said it was his role as CEO to effectively manage the situation. That never happened. Allakhverdiev departed Foretold in April 2024 after a call with leadership, but has yet to receive or sign an official termination agreement. He was owed $8,700 as of April 2024, but said he could be owed more given he was never officially offboarded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another former Foretold employee who chose to remain anonymous corroborated Allakhverdiev's testimony. They are currently owed $2,700, representing two months wages, and explained the lack of income has resulted in them taking on debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They said Kuvshynov never indicated the studio might encounter financial headwinds. Instead, Kuvshynov stated Foretold had a "bunch of investors" lined up. The cash never materialized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Michael told me they had a bunch of investors and a lot of money to fund the game, but after a single month of being paid [our wages], he told us there would be a one month delay in the payment, which then turned into no payment at all for several months and an attempt to decrease our previously agreed salaries," they added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, they alleged Foretold sought to hire new employees while still owing money to staff. "I know that he has at least attempted to hire people even while not paying the current employees," they said. "I don't know what he is telling these new hires and also don't know if he has ever paid them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Others have been burned too. Agnieszka, who worked for Foretold for around four months before departing, said they're still owed $5,000. They suggested leaders within the studio didn't indicate it was struggling financially until it was too late. Even then, they said employees were told the cash shortage would be "temporary."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was aware of the money issues a little before most of the team because I was unlucky enough not to receive my October [2023] payment. Michael had entered the wrong account number, and the money kept being transferred between banks," they explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Normally, the employer should resend the money and wait for the returned funds from the bank. However, he had no money to do that. I must admit, I finally got paid for October at the beginning of January when he received the lost money from the bank. I never received any money for November, December, or January.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="One Foretold employee forced to go &quot;begging&quot; for wages">One Foretold employee forced to go "begging" for wages</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Agnieszka, who asked for their surname to be omitted from this report, said the situation left them "begging" Kuvshynov for a $200 payment so they could cover basic expenses. Although he eventually sent over the cash, WhatsApp messages viewed by Game Developer show Kuvshynov initially tried to pay them in crypto.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I had no money for anything. Michael questioned me about what I needed the money for. It was one of the most humiliating conversations I've ever had, begging for money for food that he owed me," they continued. "He promised that he would pay everyone, and if people wanted to leave, they could leave and still get paid. It was difficult to believe him and to decide what to do—whether to quit and risk never getting paid for a month or to keep working longer in the hope that an investor would appear."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They believe some workers decided to stay in the hopes of being paid eventually, but suggested Foretold has made a point of hiring younger talent who might be easier to manipulate. "Right after I joined (and received my salary for the first week of work), a 19-year-old game designer asked me if I knew when we were finally getting paid," they said. "I was confused. It turned out he had never been paid and had been 'working there' for three months already."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Agnieszka said Foretold "hired" two people just before they departed, both of whom agreed to work for free on the understanding they would be paid later. "[Kuvshynov] has been telling people there is no money but there will be money soon. Back when he was hiring us, he did not mention any money problems."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has viewed multiple emails sent by Kuvshynov in which he confirms the studio was unable to pay thousands of dollars in wages. Additional WhatsApp messages sent by Foretold chief product officer James Kucera to one source indicate Foretold was at risk of going bankrupt. Kucera also suggested he was owed money and had been taking on contract work to make ends meet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Foretold remains in debt to employees, the studio recently announced another project set in the Tollan Universe. During the OTK Games Expo in June 2024, Foretold unveiled a 2D action roguelike called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tollan Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that will be making its early access launch in Q3 2024, officially turning Foretold into a multi-project studio. It's first project, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tollan Worlds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has yet to launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When approached for comment, Kuvshynov told Game Developer Foretold "has been struggling with fundraising over the last 12 months, which caused us not to be able to pay salaries to our team members."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"However, from the beginning, we were transparent with everyone about the situation and offered stock options as compensation for their work with us," he added. "For those who weren't interested in stock options and preffered to leave we agreed to compensate them once we raise money. As they wait for us to raise funds we stay in close contact them, answering all their questions and addressing their concerns."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All three sources have refuted those claims. They told Game Developer that Kuvshynov never indicated Foretold would only be able to pay them for one month of work before they joined the studio. They also stated that while stock options were offered, it never felt like a credible proposition given the studio was already in dire financial straits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer is currently seeking additional answers from Kuvshynov to understand why he chose to hire multiple workers without the means to pay them, when our sources should expect to be paid, and why Foretold announced another project in June when it has so far been unable to compensate its workforce.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>
Sony has now sold over 61m PlayStation 5 consoles, but hardware unit sales have fallen by 32 percent year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
The company has released its latest financial report today, revealing 2.4m PS5 consoles were sold in the most recent quarter. That compares to 3.3m compared to the same quarter in 2023 (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">4.5m in the previous quarter</a>).

</p>
<p>
However, Sony has seen an overall 12 percent increase in game revenue year-on-year, resulting in a 33 percent increase in profit.

<p>

That increase can be attributed to both an 18 percent increase in software revenue year-on-year and a 25 percent increase in Network Services revenue - predominantly PS Plus.
</p>
<p>
While Sony does not reveal subscriber numbers for PS Plus, it does state monthly active users on the PlayStation Network. This now sits at 116 million users: an increase from 108 million year-on-year, but a drop from 118 million last quarter.
</p>
<p>
Software unit sales, though, have actually dropped year-on-year by five percent, with the increased revenue and profit perhaps due to higher game prices.

<p>
This most recent quarter saw the release of PS5 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, which by the end of June had sold a million copies according to developer ShiftUp.
</p>
<p>
Other major releases include Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut on PC and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion The Final Shape.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-sales-cant-match-2023s-zelda-and-mario-success-as-console-nears-end-of-life">Nintendo sold 2.1m Switch consoles</a> in the same period. So while Sony is selling more PS5 units, Switch is just behind in its seventh year of release.

</p>

<p>MoreFun Studios has just announced that Arena Breakout: Infinite, the ‘Tarkov-killing extraction shooter’, will enter early access on August 13. Following successful beta playtests, Arena Breakout: Infinite is ready to be taken to the next level. The MoreFun Studios team is confident that now is the right time to reveal the global roadmap that’ll be delivered once the game has entered early access.</p>



<p>Check it out below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-get-ready-to-breakout">Get Ready to Breakout</h2>



<p>In a statement addressing the beta test period, MoreFun’s Enzo Zhang, the producer of the game and the Head of MoreFun Studios said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During the Closed Beta Test (CBT) earlier this year for Arena Breakout: Infinite, our team constantly improved the game, addressing bugs and adding new features. From our CBT learnings, we felt the best way to streamline and structure early access development was through our own official website. We feel this is the best and most collaborative development approach as we use this early access period to quickly deliver the most complete 1.0 version of Arena Breakout: Infinite on PC.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that there will be ‘no strings attached’ to Arena Breakout: Infinite’s early access window, and this free-to-play extraction shooter that both looks great and runs well will be available to all on PC. It’s a solid contender to Escape from Tarkov, and the extraction shooter community has long awaited an alternative to the at times controversial Russian FPS.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Arena Breakout: Infinite’s early access release:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Arena Breakout: Infinite | Early Access Coming on Aug. 13th" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqS09DtMDNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>MoreFun revealed that when Arena Breakout: Infinite enters early access, it’ll go hand-in-hand with a new map, a host of new weapons and equipment items, and other features such as a ‘killcam’ and spectate modes. Those latter elements have been at the top of the list of Tarkov players worldwide for years, but the developer, Battlestate Games, hasn’t ever implemented them. </p>



<p>Finally, ABI will get a ‘season’ system <strong>and </strong>the game has been optimised to run better on lower-tier PC hardware.</p>



<p>Will you be playing Arena Breakout: Infinite when it’s released on August 13?</p>

                <p>Usually bugs are either game-breaking, amusing, or incredibly inconvenient annoyances for players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/" data-ref-id="1900-6418072">Diablo 4</a>'s latest bug has proven to be both beneficial and popular. So much so that Activision Blizzard has already indicated that it won't be releasing a fix for the duration of the game's fifth season, Season of the Infernal Hordes.</p><p>Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-season-5-legendary-tempering-recipes-bug-patch-1851614747" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Diablo 4 allows players to upgrade their gear with Legendary Tempering recipes each season. Essentially, that system allows players to decide which affixes they want to attach to their gear. It was only introduced in the fourth season of Diablo 4, and it was supposed to reset the recipes for Season 5. However, the bug has allowed all of last season's Legendary Tempering recipes to remain in place. That's made leveling a lot easier than in the past.</p><p>Although Season of the Infernal Hordes launched today, sharp-eyed Diablo 4 players noticed the bug right away. Once the word got out, Bilzzard eventually had to respond to it. And fortunately, the company doesn't plan to do anything about it. Global community development director Adam Fletcher confirmed that the bug wasn't intentional before adding that the company is "letting this one slide."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are aware of the reports that new seasonal characters are having their tempering recipes carried over from their last seasons seasonal character. <br>This isn't the original design or intention so I wouldn't expect this for future seasons but we are letting this one slide for…</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Fletcher made it clear that the reset of tempering recipes will resume when the next season, Vessel of Hatred, arrives in October. In the meantime, it sounds like players are going to enjoy playing Season of the Infernal Hordes with more powerful gear than they would normally get to have.</p>

Completing Dungeons, Hellbreaches, and Strongholds will all have some progress carried over if you completed the earlier objectives, with the same being true for unlocking Aspects. <strong>Forsaken Offerings </strong>is one of the more time consuming objectives, since obtaining 5 caches requires you to complete Whispers worth 10 points total five times, which could be time consuming if you aren't going out of your way,</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache, contains Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache, contains summoning materials for world tier 3 bosses</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Equipment Cache, contains a legendary weapon, chest armor, and amulet for your class.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346470" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346470"></a><figcaption>Chapter 4 features objectives focused around the early part World Tier 3.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg"></figure><p><strong>You must complete nine of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Against All Hatred: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 7</li><li dir="ltr">Blessing of the Strong: Equip Sacred Legendary items in every slot</li><li dir="ltr">Grim Claim: Obtain 20 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing whispers</li><li dir="ltr">The Depths of Fear: Use 5 Nightmare Sigils to create and complete Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Touching the Eternal: Unlock 25 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">A Deathless Heart: Defeat 10 Aether Fiends</li><li dir="ltr">The Way Down: Acquire 5 Infernal Compasses</li><li dir="ltr">Eternal Champion: Enhance Infernal Compasses with Abyssal Scrolls</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Echo of Varshan in World Tier 3</li><li dir="ltr">Stem the Tide: Defeat 666 Monsters at Max Threat Level during a Helltide on World Tier 3 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 is where you will have moved on to World Tier 3, increasing the difficulty, unlocking Sacred Legendary items, and unlocking the new activity, Infernal Hordes. While there are a few continued objectives, like unlocking Aspects and obtaining caches from the Tree of Whispers, many of these objectives are focused on World Tier 3 activities. You will need to do the Infernal Hordes and completing Nightmare Dungeons is important for powering up your Paragon Board, so the only objective here to ignore if you want to is defeating Varshan in World tier 3, since you might want to save your summoning materials for World Tier 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Power and Sacrifice Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache, contains Infernal Hordes Compass, Elixirs, and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache, contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Equipment Cache, contains a legendary weapon, gloves, pants, and ring for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete eight of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Through Bile and Brimstone: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 12</li><li dir="ltr">Heir to Transcendence: Equip an Ancestral Legendary in every item slot</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 20 Helltide Commanders during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">This Is No Dream: Complete a Tier 21 or higher Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Tempered by Hellfire: Reach level 75</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Strip Their Souls: Defeat Aether Diends, Aether Lords, and Infernal Demons</li><li dir="ltr">Corruption Consumed: Collect 666 Burning Aether from Hellbreaches and Infernal Hordes in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Excommunication: Defeat The Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes Tier 2</li><li dir="ltr">Vanquishing Hell's Best: Defeat Champion Monsters in World Tier 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Slayer moves you into World Tier 4, the highest difficulty. Some of these objectives, like completing the Tier 21 or higher Nightmare Dungeon, are very simple to complete, since that's one of the lowest tiers available in World Tier 4. A lot of these objectives are related to Infernal Hordes, so that is where most of your time will be spent.

The service launched with all of <em>The Simpsons, Star Wars</em>, and most Marvel movies, as well as a large collection of classic Disney films, shows, and animated shorts. In the five years since it started, Disney+ has grown more and more, as Disney has added Hulu shows, more original content, Fox-owned properties, and licensed shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/doctor-who/1ml73V6phgyZ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/doctor-who/1ml73V6phgyZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Doctor Who</em></a></span> to the service<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>But all that content doesn’t come cheap and over the last few years, the price of Disney+ has increased almost every year.

			<p>Final Fantasy XVI release on PC could be imminent, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Following the release of the latest NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready driver, which introduced support for soon-to-be-released games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-out-now-hunt-showdown-1896-gets-dlss-level-zero-extraction-launches-with-dlss-3/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1elhiea/comment/lgsrnjc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> that the new release also features a game driver profile for Square Enix's latest main entry in the series. With the inclusion of the game's profile, there's little doubt that the game's release shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI's imminent release on PC shouldn't come as a surprise for those who have been following the game, as it was said multiple times in the past few months that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-release-pc-complete-edition/">PC release wasn't too far off in the future</a>. A playable demo is also scheduled to release before launch, so it definitely seems like it won't be too long before we are finally able to experience Clive's adventure with high framerates, as the game supposedly runs at 1<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-runs-at-100fps-on-high-end-hardware-says-yoshida/">00 FPS and above on high-end hardware.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-5-class-tier-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-diablo-4-season-5-class-tier-list.946425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-5-class-tier-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the launch of Season 5 of Diablo 4 and the ARPG in its best state ever, now’s a fantastic time to level a new character to 100. You can jump straight into the seasonal storyline, which introduces Infernal Hordes or farm Helltides to level quickly. I did both! Before you start, however, here’s our Diablo 4 Season 5 class tier list!</p>



<h2 id="h-our-class-tier-list-for-diablo-4-season-5">Our Class Tier List for Diablo 4 Season 5</h2>



<p>With five classes to choose from and many possibilities regarding viable builds, there’s never been a better time to test out a lesser-player class in Diablo 4 than in Season 5. If you’re accustomed to playing the same class and build, why not try something different this time around? I say as I play Barbarian again!</p>



<p>Here’s our class tier list for Season 5 in Diablo 4:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>S-Tier</strong>: Rogue and Sorcerer</li>



<li><strong>A-Tier</strong>: Necromancer</li>



<li><strong>B-Tier</strong>: Druid</li>



<li><strong>C-Tier</strong>: Barbarian</li>
</ul>



<p>As a Barbarian main, it pains me to place Barbarian on the lowest rung of the tier list. But following Blizzard’s infinite wisdom in nerfing many of my beloved Barb’s skills into the ground, it’s still a viable class to play but certainly not the most powerful this season.</p>



<p>That said, Rogue and Sorcerer, on the other hand, prove themselves to be the most capable and powerful characters in Season 5. They’re viable for leveling and end-game content, with the Sorcerer’s Lightning Spear build taking center stage. I saw it firsthand during a Helltide and, despite playing my Barbarian, nearly swapped to a new character then and there!</p>







<h2 id="h-which-class-should-you-play-first-in-season-5">Which Class Should You Play First in Season 5?</h2>



<p>If you insist on following the meta and wish to push end-game content, such as the Infernal Hordes and Pit, I highly recommend playing a Rogue this season. They’re nimble, potent, and boast high survivability, thanks to numerous buffs and enhancements. Furthermore, some of the latest unique, such as The Umbracrux, ensure you’re lightning-quick and striking down Elite and Boss enemies quickly and efficiently!</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you prefer magic, the Sorcerer is a good choice. It offers numerous viable builds, and as mentioned, the Lightning Spear is a capable and powerful playstyle!</p>
