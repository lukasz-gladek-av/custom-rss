But its announcement also may have confirmed a major leak for the service — a line-up of games coming to the N64 app (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-latest-switch-online-news-couldve-just-confirmed-a-major-leak/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">Back in July 2025</a>, an eagle-eyed fan and <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925">VTuber on X</a> (alongside friends on Discord) spotted what looked to be blurred box art for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2</a>, and the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros</a> alongside a certain 'Mature' N64 game — Forsaken — in a trailer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/youtube.com/watch?v=wDNg1pwrTVg&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">posted back in May</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Forsaken's arrival on the Mature app seems to have all-but-confirmed that the other titles spotted above are also coming. You can see the blurred boxes <a href="https://youtu.be/wDNg1pwrTVg?si=A4xAoMBhc0OHgzGx&amp;t=41">at around 0:41</a>.</p>

<p>If true, that's a pretty solid list of games — and given <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s release in July, many have been clamouring for DK's other 3D platformer to make its way to the service.</p>
<p>Crucially, of course, nothing is confirmed until Nintendo itself makes the announcement, and we have no idea when we'll actually get these games, <em>if</em> the blurred-out image is to be believed. We'll just have to wait and see...</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out Forsaken from tomorrow if you have the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p><em>Do you hope to see DK64, Smash, Glover, and Rayman 2 on NSO soon? Do you see the games in the blurred image? Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

			<p>Silent Hill F will be a great showcase of what Unreal Engine 5 can deliver with proper work in terms of image quality and performance, judging from some early impressions.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed that the PC and PlayStation 5 build available during Gamescom last month behind closed doors did an excellent job showing how the engine by Epic is fully capable of delivering clean image quality and stable performance with no stuttering. The game's performance, in particular, sounds impressive for a game powered by the engine, as it ran at stable 60 FPS on base PlayStation and PC, though not at native 4K resolution, with 30 FPS-locked cutscene that still managed to look great thanks to a very good usage of motion blur. Better yet, none of the obnoxiuous stuttering issues too often seen in Unreal Engine 5-powered games were present, which definitely sounds promising. The game looked so clean, without the typical temporal noise seen in other games, and ran so well that it was almost difficult to tell it is powered by Unreal Engine 5, according to Digital Foundry, although a more in-depth look revealed the use of software Lumen which delivers great lighting in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's definitely great to hear how Silent Hill F will deliver on the technical front, as it is the first brand new entry in the series to be released as part of Konami's revival of the franchise. It is also set to be among the most unique entry in the series to date, featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom-onl-2025-trailer/">combat mechanics</a> like dodging and a stamina bar which many thought were influenced by FromSoftware's Souls series. This, however, isn't exactly the case, <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-producer-game-is-not-a-soulslike/">according to producer Motoi Okamoto</a>, as similar mechanics not only were featured in past entries in the series in some form, but they also aren't exclusive to the soulslike genre.</p>



<p>Silent Hill F creeps worldwide on PC and PlayStation 5 on September 25.</p>

            <p>A company backed by the Saudi Arabian government's Public Investment Fund have become the co-owner of the Evolution Championship Series (Evo) fighting game tournament.</p>
<p>Following Sony's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-sells-ownership-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming">sale of their stake in Evo</a>, with India-based esports company Nodwin gaming buying it up, the event's co-owners have been Nodwin and talent management company RTS. Well, RTS have now been bought by Qiddiya Investment Company, a PIF-backed firm that's also overseeing the building of Qiddiya City as part of Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/muhannadaldawood_excited-to-share-that-qiddiya-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-has-activity-7368405316906016770-cYJX/">LinkedIn</a>, Qiddiya's chief strategy officer Muhannad Aldawood called the move "a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem". He added: "Most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world’s largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited potentials."</p>
<p>As with the array of other games industry-related <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/saudi-arabia-increases-stake-in-electronic-arts">investments</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snk-saudi-arabias-96-ownership-doesnt-affect-us-in-any-way">acquisitions</a> Saudi PIF and Saudi government-backed firms like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/what-is-savvy-games-group-and-how-is-it-trying-to-change-saudi-arabias-image">Savvy Games Group</a> have made in recent years, the word of the day is sportswashing. The country's been accused of using videogame investments like these and the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Esports World Cup</a> - as well as paying to host the likes of the 2034 World Cup, WWE events, and the LIV Golf series - as part of efforts to turn around its terrible international reputation.</p><p>A bad reputation Saudi Arabia and bin Salman's regime have earned through an abysmal <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/">human rights record</a> including <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/05/17/lgbtq-death-penalty-idahobit/">state-sanctioned homophobia</a>, the murder of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Kashoggi</a>, and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2023/08/21/they-fired-us-rain/saudi-arabian-mass-killings-ethiopian-migrants-yemen-saudi">mass killings of migrants</a> at the country's border with Yemen. Invest in things people in other countries already like or follow, and maybe all of that gets buried a bit in the collective consciousness - or so appears to be the goal.</p>
<p>It's not surprising then, that when you visit <a href="https://qiddiya.com/">Qiddiya's website</a>, the first thing you see is big splash about the freshly-built Qiddiya City golf course. "This is the stage on which the Kingdom showcases its rich culture and traditions to the world and the bridge that connects us to the wonderful things the rest of the world has to offer," reads the self-described "PIF company and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/12/04/die-first-and-ill-pay-you-later/saudi-arabias-giga-projects-built-widespread">giga project</a>"'s blurb on culture.</p>
<p>We'll have to see what immediate effects, if any, this ownership change has on Evo. However, as my former VG247 news running mate Connor Makar notes at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Eurogamer</a>, several prominent members of the Evo/fighting game community have already shared their disapproval or begun looking towards alternative events.</p>
<p>"Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news," <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote</a> professional Street Fighter player ChrisCCH. "Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-usb-c-to-dual-hdmi-adapter-hits-all-time-low-escape-the-one-screen-laptop-setup-for-almost-free-2000622363</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-usb-c-to-dual-hdmi-adapter-hits-all-time-low-escape-the-one-screen-laptop-setup-for-almost-free.1287591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops are miracles of productivity, but they’re limited to just one screen of workspace. Even the big boys with their ultra-sharp 17-inch displays are, well, just one 17-inch display for all of those windows you multitasking mavens want to have open at one time. Reaching the full potential of your laptop or even your tablet requires an extra screen, or maybe even two, and the <strong>Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter </strong>is the perfect tool to make that happen. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Even better, it’s just $25 right now in a limited-time Amazon deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter requires no extra software or drivers, just plug-and-play with any compatible laptop or tablet with an USB-C port. Windows laptops can be extended to two additional 4K monitors either in mirror mode, with all three screens showing the same image, or extended desktop mode with A-B-B or A-B-C configuration. MacOS laptops can extend to two additional 4K monitors in mirror mode or A-B-B extended desktop mode. Smartphones with a USB-C port can also be connected to a dual-HDMI display.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge Configuration Potential</h2>
<p>While the Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter can definitely be thought of as an ideal laptop-to-external monitor device, its capabilities don’t end there. On the USB-C source side of the adapter, compatible tablets and smartphones are also just a plug-and-play connection away from being mirrored onto a much-larger screen. That screen isn’t just limited to HDMI-compatible external monitors, either. TVs and projectors with an HDMI input port are also accessible to your USB-C devices, and without the need for a driver or app.</p>
<p>The potential use for these connections is nearly limitless. The productivity boost of going from one small screen to one small screen and two large 4K screens is obvious. But now instead of having to pass your smartphone or tablet from person to person to show off those pictures and videos you shot on vacation, you can connect your compatible USB-C device to an external monitor, big-screen TV, or projector and put on a show.</p>



<h2>Pocket-Sized Power</h2>
<p>We’ve seen hubs and ports that, while powerful and versatile, are large and/or requiring their own source of AC power. The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter is anything but bulky. It’s 2 inches by 2.5 inches in size — smaller than a credit card — and just under a half-inch thick. The adapter’s weight is negligible at 1.7 ounces, so you can stick it on your pocket or laptop bag and bring it out anywhere there’s a HDMI-compatible display at the ready.</p>
<p>The Anker name that’s so trusted for charging devices is also a sign of quality for this multi-device adapter. Anker covers the USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter with a worry-free 18-month warranty should anything go wrong. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Amazon’s limited-time deal makes this a $25 accessory that guarantees you’ll never look at working on one small screen the same way again.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Reaper Actual Has Blockchain Features, and I Spoke to the Developer to Figure Out Why—INTERVIEW]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/reaper-actual-blockchain-developer-why-interview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reaper-actual-has-blockchain-features-and-i-spoke-to-the-developer-to-figure-out-why%E2%80%94interview.1287585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Reaper Actual is an upcoming open-world first-person shooter with persistence. It will one day accommodate hundreds of players on a single server, boast a breathing ecosystem featuring the evolution of time, weather, and factions, and it’s going to be free to play. If that doesn’t sound good enough, consider that it’s designed to be accessible, no matter your skill level.</p>



<p>Well, the first impressions of Reaper Actual are often derailed slightly when prospective fans learn that the game has blockchain and NFT elements built into it. This was a huge concern for me, but since talking to the team at Distinct Possibility Studios at Gamescom, I caught up with them once again to dispel any worries about the NFT mechanics in Reaper Actual.</p>



<p>I’m happy to say that, once I learned how it all works, I’m satisfied it’s not going to be a problem.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview, if you’d rather see it that way:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Reaper Actual's PvPvE(vE) World Explored with Matt Higby - Developer Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-vRol-pTgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-getting-into-the-blockchain-with-reaper-actual">Getting Into the Blockchain with Reaper Actual</h2>



<p>Reaper Actual takes elements from open-world shooters, arcade games like Call of Duty, and extraction shooters like Escape from Tarkov. It’s from developers that formerly worked on the likes of PlanetSide and H1Z1, and it’s being designed as an open-ended and ever-evolving game with a rolling meta and customization features out the wazoo.</p>



<p>It’s surprising to some to learn that Reaper Actual also has elements that place the game on the blockchain. I don’t <strong>fully </strong>understand that world, but I know enough to appreciate that, for some gamers, that’s a <strong>huge </strong>red flag.</p>



<p>I sat down with Distinct Possibility Studios co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Matthew Higby, to learn how these NFT mechanics work in Reaper Actual.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The things that you’ll be able to buy, sell… Bases are a good example. You’ll be able to buy a base which will be a unique unit at an address in the game world. You can think of that like an elevator in a high-rise building or the entrance to a bunker facility — multiple people can have bases within that same location, but each one is like a unique fingerprint.</p>



<p>Not only is it unique in terms of what the base by default is, but it also contains all of the upgrades that you do to it as a player over time.</p>



<p>If you levelled up your base to be able to make really good sniper rifles and that represents some number of hours and some number of credits and investments to level your base up, if you decided to sell that base, you could just rip out all those upgrades if you wanted to and get your credits back, but you could just package up the base with the upgrades you’ve installed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Higby’s words, it’s ‘an increase to ownership’ in Reaper Actual, giving players a kind of <strong>financial control </strong>over their bases that they invest time and effort in to build up. While we discussed <strong>bases</strong>, I also learned that <strong>Reapers</strong>, the game’s character models, will be available to list as NFTs after being upgraded and evolved by players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Another thing you’ll be able to mint and sell are Reapers. As I mentioned, they’re permutationally unique characters that exist within the game. They have a combination of things that can make them situationally attractive for different roles and missions.</p>



<p>Between all of this and their biography, their name, their look, they have a pretty unique combination of things, and it’s just a very easy way to convey that, to allow people to trade those things. It’s with the functionality that you get with an NFT, where it’s just all contained in one cryptographic asset.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-but-are-nfts-optional-in-reaper-actual">But Are NFTs Optional in Reaper Actual?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As I dove down the rabbit hole with Matt, I learned how <strong>practical </strong>the blockchain mechanics are in Reaper Actual. Players can spend hours building up a base to then sell it to someone who would rather purchase one ready-made than grind themselves to get it. It’s a real estate market in that respect.</p>



<p>Matt explained further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It makes it feel like it’s something that’s yours, and that’s how we’re trying to lean into NFTs. One of the things that they get maligned on, and people have opinions on all sides of the map about this stuff, is that they tend to be viewed only as this speculative vehicle and the reason they’re in the game is because people want to be doing money stuff with them, or whatever.</p>



<p>In reality, a lot of these mechanics can be utility-granting and utility-oriented, right?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Practical is one thing, but what about optional? Not everyone enjoys the concept of NFTs, and in the gaming world, the term has long been seen as the boogeyman. I asked Matt if you could play Reaper Actual just fine without investing in the blockchain side of things.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Totally, yeah. We’re going to be running the game on Steam, we’re going to be running on Epic, and those environments, it’s going to be completely devoid of the Web3 mechanics. All of the functionality is going to be exactly the same.</p>



<p>There will still be permutationally unique Reapers, you’ll still be able to upgrade and sell your house, you’ll just be using it with a different kind of currency.</p>



<p>What I hope that we can do is show that these blockchain mechanics can be a force for good and not just for greed, and that there’s actually a sort of value that gets unlocked by using them. One thing that is guaranteed to be true about this game is that it’s unlike any other game you’ve played before.</p>



<p>If people really like the feeling of playing one of these peristent world games, then maybe they’ll decide to take the extra step and go try it on the Web3 service if they feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Distinct Possibility Studios wants to offer the NFT mechanics to those who want them, but it’s not at all critical to the overarching game <strong>experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Everything else that I learned in my deep dive with Matt Higby was more than enough to fill me with serious interest in Reaper Actual, and with an intended release window of Q1 2026, it’s only a matter of time before we can all dive in.</p>



<p>Do you think Reaper Actual is your kind of game? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to spend more on the new James Bond game from the makers of Hitman, you'll apparently be able to. Another Amazon listing reveals a collector's edition that costs $300. There is no word on what may be in the collector's edition to justify the price tag, but the description says the package weighs six pounds. Listings for the $300 edition were discovered for all platforms except Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Industry experts believe people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, and that it's just a matter of time before higher price points for games become normalized. For now, though, many companies are sticking with $70 for new games (and also offering more expensive premium editions and selling lots of DLC and microtransactions at the same time). </p><p>Mario Kart World was the first major game to jump up to $80, though it is also available within a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft planned to charge $80 for games this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">scuttled those plans.</a> For its part, EA has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-battlefield-6-coming-ea-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-charge-80-for-games/1100-6533540/" data-ref-id="1100-6533540">no plans to charge $80 for games</a>, while Rockstar owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">Take-Two responded to a question about GTA 6's price</a>, but didn't confirm anything.</p><p>These listings were first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a></p><p>007 First Light is set for release in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. There have been numerous James Bond video games over the years, of course--including the iconic GoldenEye 007--but 007 First Light is the first to tell an origin story for the world-famous character.</p><p>You'll play as James Bond when he's 26 years old and in the Royal Navy, prior to becoming the British superspy everyone knows today. He gets recruited for MI6 and eventually its elite 00 section.</p><p>The State of Play today, September 3, will showcase 30 minutes of gameplay, showing off Bond taking on his first mission.

<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158450/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Fans of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/everybodys_golf">Everybody’s Golf</a> have had to twiddle their one-gloved thumbs for a while now, waiting since 2017 for a new official entry in the series. Mashing together the series’ previously regionally distinct names (Everybody’s Golf and Hot Shots Golf), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots</a> has finally stepped up to the tee. Have series newcomers Hyde (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>) hit a hole in one, or is this more like a triple bogey? Well, a bit of both really.</p>
<p>For almost all of its history, Everybody’s Golf was developed by Clap Hanz and published by Sony. Hyde is in the driving seat now, with Bandai Namco on the publishing side, unlocking the series from PlayStation for the first time. However, they’re clearly working from the same playbook, keeping what works best in the series while adding some novel ideas of their own.</p>
<p>The Everybody’s Golf series combines deceptively detailed physics and subtle controls with cartoonish characters. It absolutely works as a pick-up-and-play party game, but equally rewards deeper engagement. The basic controls involve facing where you want the ball to go, then pressing 'A' three times to set power and accuracy.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158445/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That works well for a breezy round of golf, but once you start getting into the intricacies of spin, accounting for the wind, and working with the slopes of the course — and, as your stats develop, exploiting silly shortcuts like using the fairways of other holes, skipping across water, or bouncing along paths — the skill ceiling leaves lots of space to have fun.</p>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots follows this formula with gusto. There are more than 25 characters to unlock, and 10 regions on the World Tour. You can now choose a caddy to accompany you on the course – this gives a face to the previously disembodied voices offering encouraging comments after teeing off, putting advice on the green, or squeaks of dismay when you fluff a shot.</p>
<p>The core game mode is Challenge, which sets up short tournaments or versus matches, and winning them levels up and unlocks more courses. World Tour, meanwhile, is a bizarrely story-led setup. Fairly tedious cutscenes present odd tales — a girl seeking stardom, a hostile takeover of a golf theme park — somehow circuitously resulting in the repeated need to play golf. It seems the devs know what they've done here, as the option to turn off all cutscenes is front and centre. Online play makes a return, although no games were available while testing.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158447/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest addition is Wacky Golf, which lets you play with obstacles scattered around the course, play a game stealing your opponents' clubs, or have a round of “boom golf” where your ball may spontaneously explode after any shot, sending it flying in a random direction. These were fun for a bit of multiplayer, but ultimately throwaway. When it comes down to it, the core of the game is well balanced – these quirky ideas only interfere.</p>
<p>For those looking to get deep into the game, a loyalty system lets you develop individual characters by playing as them, unlocking special skills and abilities. You can purchase food, which boosts stats like power or spin, and can be shared across characters, letting you spread progress instead of getting stuck with one overlevelled main. Essentially, you can fatten up one character by feeding them on the winnings of another.</p>
<p>Now, all of this so far would suggest that we have a solid Everybody’s Golf on our hands, and series fans will be all smiles. Here comes the big 'but', and it’s all about performance on Switch. This is a game all about pressing a button at just the right time, and for that you need fluid visual feedback. I felt a lack of smoothness made accuracy suffer. I went back to my PS TV to compare with the 2011 entry in the series and definitely found that to be smoother.</p>
<figure><a title="Everybody's Golf Hot Shots Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s worse is that using special skills — decorated as they are by fancy graphical effects — dropped the frame rate even further. Those special shots are supposed to get you out of difficult situations, but they’re too risky to be usable on Switch. I tried out Switch 2 and things were noticeably better. However, the overall frame rate was not improved. I got used to it, but the game deserves better.</p>
<p>Even with these performance limitations, trees look simplistic, there’s heavy level-of-detail pop-in, and grass textures are flat. The lighting and colours are nice, with night golf now an option, but I would take just about any visual cut to get smoother performance. One footnote here is that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730810/EVERYBODYS_GOLF_HOT_SHOTS/">Bandai Namco revealed</a> some of the foliage textures were produced using generative AI. Looking at the results, it’s hard to imagine that any added efficiency was worth the loss of cred from using the controversial technology.</p>
<p>The soundscape of the game is chaotic. The swings and strikes and the tuneful rattle of the ball into the cup are all delightful, while the music is like a corny jingle from a Tokyo convenience store. Over the top of everything, your multiple caddies and players make extremely caricatured remarks – often all at the same time. There’s no way on Earth that Hyde didn’t realise how bonkers it all sounds, so you have to take it as a stylistic choice – one that strangely grew on me, I must admit.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Everybody’s Golf Hot Shots carries on the series traditions with solid courses, a robust character levelling system, and the appropriate level of silliness. However, the experience is uneven on Switch. Fans may enjoy it in short bursts, but technical issues and patchy presentation stop it from being the standout entry it could have been.</p></section>

<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 leaks have arrived, revealing the new season’s heroes, battle pass, skins, team-ups, a new game mode, and more. </p>



<p>As we draw closer to Marvel Rivals season 4, more leaks and rumors have started circulating. A recent claim stated Marvel Rivals could finally be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-debut-could-finally-be-happening-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making its debut on PS4</a>. New leaks regarding Marvel Rivals Season 4 have surfaced online, revealing details about the upcoming content expected in the next season.  </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-leaked-heroes">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Leaked Heroes</h2>



<p>The leaked information about Marvel Rivals Season 4 originated from a Russian Discord channel, via XOXLEAK on <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962964070581338220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) and Dylbobz on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92EIFCUXkrI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. Their new post states that the season name is called Heart of the Dragon, the launch hero will be Angela, and the second hero is Daredevil. Angela has some kind of temporary flying mechanic and has a melee-based skillset with a “bow or perhaps a spear”. Daredevil has an Asian-styled design and opposes Angela, “embodying the Dragon and the Tiger.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>POSSIBLE Season 4 leak:</p><p>Launch Hero: ANGELA</p><p>Angela has some kind of fly mechanic (temporary), looks to be a melee hero but it seems she has a Bow or perhaps a Spear. </p><p>Battle Pass:<br>"FRUIT OF IMORTALITY"<br>Skins: <br>– Moon Knight (Mecha Knight from what if)<br>– Phoenix (presumably… <a href="https://t.co/2G4m37DfOT">pic.twitter.com/2G4m37DfOT</a></p></div>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1962960946340548810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-battle-pass-and-skin-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass and Skin Leaks</h2>



<p>Coming to Marvel Rivals Season 4 Battle Pass, it is reportedly called “Fruits of Immortality”. It will feature skins like Moon Knight Mecha Knight from Marvel’s What If…? series, a new Phoenix skin which is “presumably Dark Phoenix”, and a Phoenix Force Loki skin which is Red and has feathers. There is seemingly a new Ultron Wasteland skin to look forward to as well. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-game-mode-and-team-ups">New Game Mode and Team Ups </h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 4 is reportedly arriving with a new quick-play game mode that allows players to select the same heroes multiple times. Regarding Team-Ups, Human Torch, Black Panther, and Psylocke are the first ones; Venom and Captain America are the second ones. </p>



<p>Regardless, the information doesn’t come from the usual source; therefore, readers should take it with a massive grain of salt. All will be confirmed when the new season trailer arrives this week. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re brave enough to tackle the terrors of Bloober Team’s new Cronos: The New Dawn IP, I can tell you first-hand that the trophy list isn’t easy. This guide has every known achievement, as well as all the hidden and secret trophies you normally have to venture into the game to find out.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> isn’t for the faint-hearted. It’s a survival-horror game with an emphasis on psychological torment, as well as physical endangerment—thanks to the game’s litany of disfigured, slimy menaces. I had an endless sense of unease playing the game, but it was worth it. I also happened to scoop up a ton of trophies and achievements on the way.</p>



<p>If you want to see the Cronos: The New Dawn trophy list for yourself, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-cronos-the-new-dawn-achievements-amp-trophies">All Cronos: The New Dawn Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>

<p>This is the default trophy list you’ll see when you first start up <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/cronos/cronos-the-new-dawn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. These are the trophies and achievements Bloober Team wants you to see. The tasks the developer wants you to know about before you begin.</p>



<p>You already get an idea of how tough this endeavor is. Check out the non-spoiler trophies and achievements.</p>



<ul>

</ul>







<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is a story-driven single-player game. This means many of its trophies and achievements are purposely hidden. I’ve done you the service of concealing them from the main list. This is your final warning: If you don’t want to know anything about Cronos story spoilers or possible content you’ll encounter, turn away now!</p>



<p><strong>*SPOILER WARNING*</strong></p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-cronos-the-new-dawn">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2>



<p><strong>There is a grand total of 48 PlayStation Trophies and 47 Xbox Achievements for you to pursue in Cronos: The New Dawn.</strong></p>



<p>Granted, a lot of Cronos is <em>you </em>being hunted and chased down. If you’re hankering for the game’s full set of extra accomplishments, though, you need to keep the entire list in mind. You can’t get every trophy and achievement on your first playthrough, as it’s impossible. </p>



<p>Getting the Platinum Trophy requires at least one more run—there is no Platinum Trophy for Xbox users, be warned.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s hopefully the start of something special for Bloober Team and Cronos: The New Dawn. It’s an incredible new IP with all the makings of a new series. I enjoyed it, but let me know how you get on with it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

These bullet-sponges can shrug off just about anything you can throw at them, and while they aren't unkillable, a Helldivers team is going to need to call in multiple drops of anti-tank weaponry and hellbombs to take down this skyscraper-sized titan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ34QSm-nJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZ34QSm-nJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fighting a Hive Lord is challenging enough, but defending yourself from one is also a Herculean labor. The massive worms can burrow underground for surprise attacks, erupting to shower the battlefield with rocks or flatten you with their sheer mass. If that wasn't bad enough, they can blanket the area in corrosive bile, forcing teams to stay on the move during these fights.</p><p>So far, the best strategy for dealing with a Hive Lord is a classic from Arthurian legend: <a href="https://youtu.be/MUG9VzHoEoc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run away</a>. Sure, a Hive Lord has a few exposed areas under its armor and a mouth that an anti-tank rocket can comfortably fit inside of, but the best course of action here is to strategically retreat and carry on with your regular mission objectives.</p><p>Hive Lords require an absurd amount of resources to take down--<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/" rel="nofollow ">one team says it used 10 Hellbombs, eight 500KG bombs, and several stratagems to get the job done</a>--and so far it looks like there's no reward for killing one, other than the sweet feeling of protecting democracy for another day from the monster.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

This original game blends survival horror with sci-fi, taking place in an alternate history Poland in the 1960s, under Soviet control. You explore the destroyed and life-less city, looking for jump points to find people in the past who could help prevent disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips and guides on the toughest parts of Cronos: The New Dawn check out our guide on the optional <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-the-hospital-chapel-puzzle-in-cronos-the-new-dawn/1100-6534152/">Hospital Chapel puzzle</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the completion time of three members of the GameSpot team, Cronos: The New Dawn will take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete. While there is some optional exploration and puzzle-solving to be done, the biggest swing in playtimes will come down to how difficult you find the combat to be. Cronos: The New Dawn has some tough encounters and restrictive inventory management, which could result in you getting stuck on some of the harder combat challenges.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list</h2><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn comprises four major sections rather than distinct chapter names, so there is no true Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list per se.. The location names don't contain any spoilers beyond what kind of areas you will eventually explore. Between these areas, you will often travel back to a hubspace inside a defunct tram station, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn sections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Apartments</li><li dir="ltr">Steelworks</li><li dir="ltr">Hospital</li><li dir="ltr">Church Abbey</li></ul>

			<p>Bloober Team has always been synonymous with horror, from their earliest days with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/16/layers-of-fear-review/">Layers of Fear</a> through to the high profile <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> remake. It has, however, been nearly 5 years since their last original title, the somewhat divisive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium,</a> so the pressure on Cronos: The New Dawn to deliver is heightened. Can the Polish developers follow up on the success of their work on Konami’s legendary series in a story of their own devising? To do so, Cronos takes clear influences from the usual survival horror mainstays of Silent Hill and Resident Evil but there is also a large slice of Dead Space, from character design to gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | A New Breed Of Horror" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9dY2fTE07h0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos features a complicated narrative full of time travel and dimensional travel, but it all boils down to a story of betrayal, grief, and coping with the effects of a pandemic. Post Covid-19 any story that revolves around communities locked down to prevent the spread of disease will take on a greater resonance for players and this is certainly the case here. Notes and environmental cues abound that tell a tale of a scared population torn between self preservation and communal survival. The disease here is a mysterious affliction that turns victims into monstrous ghouls that merge with each other to create even greater threats.</p>


<p>Dead Space is the most obvious influence here graphically, with the main protagonist, enigmatically named The Traveller, wearing an exosuit that recalls Isaac Clarke (and Bioshock’s Big Daddy to a lesser extent). The Traveller feels similarly chunky too, with deliberate movement rather than agility being the name of the game. Environments are largely dark and depressing, with effective mood lighting and signposting alongside some gnarly body horror aspects. Many areas are covered in a biomass that oozes and throbs as you move past it, whilst others are desolate and windswept. These environments are contrasted with occasional serene moments where you travel back to the town of New Dawn before the epidemic and are faced with scenes of everyday normality.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of New Dawn follows the familiar pattern of finding keys, unlocking shortcuts and solving environmental puzzles. The latter does feature the new addition of a power that can manipulate timespace anomalies to change the environment for your benefit. This is mostly used to reveal hidden paths (sometimes requiring you to take detours to find an angle where the anomaly is visible) or to access secret areas filled with loot but later game boss fights also use this mechanic to great effect. The progression is quite strictly linear, which feels appropriate for survival horror and means that there is little backtracking.</p>
<p>Alongside your anomaly manipulation power, you have a basic melee attack which is mostly used to destroy item boxes or as a last resort when ammo is low, and an adaptable sidearm which can take various forms to mimic the standard horror arsenal. It starts as a basic handgun that can be charged for extra damage, but you find shotgun, automatic, and even a powerful arbalest as you make your way through the horrors of New Dawn. Somewhat annoyingly, however, these different forms take up extra spaces in your limited inventory so I found myself sticking to the initial handgun and shotgun throughout. I appreciate that this is a convention of the genre, but some games have taken to separating the inventory from your weapons and I think this enables you to try out a greater range of weapons, aiding in a feel of gameplay variety. Upgrading weapons is a slow process too and whilst this is undone for a small cost your current guns are usually more effective than the ones you find.</p>

<p>Combat is a deliberate and intense affair. Many enemies take multiple shots to go down, with fully charging being essential. If you allow enemies to merge they become even more powerful, eventually being impervious to bullets and requiring you to use fire and explosive barrels to damage them. My first playthrough resulted in me being hunted by a merged enemy when I had no ammo to damage it and necessitated a reload as I came to terms with this mechanic. Setting fire to corpses prevents merging, but you also have limited torch ammo so you need to be strategic as to when to use it.</p>
<p>You are not entirely alone in your quest though as you are preceded by a host of former operatives who leave clues, tools, and pathways for you to find. Fairly early on you’ll also meet The Warden, a fellow traveller who plays an increasingly important role in the story of Cronos. Alan Turkington brings a welcome degree of mystery and gravitas to this role in his vocal performance. You’ll also find survivors, some of whom are targets for retrieval as you are sent to recover their ‘essence’ in order to learn how to prevent the tragic disease from happening. The moral ambiguities around this process are a key part of the larger tale being told and it is far from a simple hero’s story.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, however, are the ten cats that are scattered throughout the game. Finding these furry friends almost always requires venturing off the main path or solving optional puzzles, but the rewards for doing so are worth it. Most obvious are extra currency or upgrade materials but, once rescued, these feline companions also congregate in your main base and provide a welcome level of life to the desolated environment. Other upgrades can be found through absorbing the aforementioned ‘essence’ with each providing different buffs. There are various achievement that rely on you maintaining specific essences throughout but an initial playthrough will see you swapping each out as you progress with only three being able to be stored at once.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cronos: The New Dawn is a great new survival horror property and I hope we see more of The Traveller’s adventures in future. The clear influences from genre legends are combined with some original touches to make a game that feels familiar but also manages to innovate and surprise players too. The intriguing narrative, the enjoyable progression, and the challenging combat all combine to make an experience that cements Bloober’s place as horror specialists.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Before Arkane Austin made its Prey game, a developer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/human-head-rune-ragnarok-interview/">Human Head Studios</a> created and developed Prey as a first-person shooter centered around a Cherokee named Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi, who ventures on a quest to save his grandfather and his girlfriend after they're taken by an alien spaceship currently in orbit around the Earth. It was released on PC and Xbox 360, and a sequel was in development until the game was cancelled in 2014.</p>



<p>Between 2006 and 2014, the rights for Human Head Studios' Prey went from its 3D Realms, who initially helped publish the game, to a different company called Radar Group, to ZeniMax Media, who modern players will recognize today as a Bethesda and ZeniMax company, and overall a subsidiary of Microsoft and Xbox. It was under ZeniMax, unfortunately, where Prey 2, which had bounced around in development limbo for years, was canceled, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rune-developer-human-head-studios-closes-down-and-reopens-as-roundhouse-studios-at-bethesda/">Human Head Studios was officially shuttered</a> and subsumed into Bethesda as Roundhouse Studios in 2019.</p>



<p>Now, more than a decade after Prey 2 was cancelled and a little under a decade since Arkane Austin made its entirely separate but similarly titled Prey, gameplay footage for Human Head Studios' Prey 2 has leaked online.</p>



<p>A post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/">Reddit</a> includes links for what would have been Prey 2's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5vbwq7X3G8">opening</a>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSNdZBLCvog">gameplay demo</a> that might've appeared at an E3 show, and a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDwfoEv20iE">earlier development</a> clips of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoYaYVPY5WA">gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J7OIifeZ-s">combat</a>, all uploaded by a YouTube channel under the name '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.'</p>



<p>The footage is incomplete, but it does give fans of the 2006 Prey a sense of what the team was striving for in a sequel, hoping to take the core elements of Human Head's first Prey game and evolve on them.</p>



<p>At the time of Human Head Studios' shuttering, co-founder Chris Rhinehart said, "<em>Sadly, we had to wind down the business of Human Head Studios and close its doors, which was particularly devastating due to the passion and creativity of the team we’d assembled</em>."</p>



<p>The video game industry wasn't in such dire straits in 2019 compared to its current state, so thankfully, at the time, the whole team was able to stay together and were given new jobs at the aforementioned Roundhouse Studios, which was formed under Bethesda as a way to keep Human Head together. Though it only bought them a few more years, since the mass layoffs since then, not to mention the latest round of mass layoffs that saw significant cuts to <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, likely split the team up for good. </p>

			<p>Following the release of several <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/">horror games</a> to a reception ranging from positive to mildly negative, sometimes due to how particular sensitive themes were addressed, Polish developer Bloober Team has risen considerably in the estimation of survival horror fans for the excellent work the studio has done with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, a faithful adaptation of the classic Konami game enhanced by some modern features that make it a joy to play. While the Polish studio is set to continue this fruitful collaboration with the development of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/"> remake of the first entry in the series</a>, Bloober Team is also expanding its own properties with new titles, the first of them being Cronos: The New Dawn. Right from the game's reveal, it was made clear how this game would be a threshold release for the studio, moving past the narrative-focused experiences such as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/layers-of-fear-now-truly-finished/"> Layers of Fear series</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> to delve deeper into the survival horror genre. And while it is definitely a little flawed, there's no denying that Bloober Team created a solid game that becomes rather engaging once things really get going.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The true mission of The Travel and the real purpose of The Collective are among the mysteries hidden in Cronos: The New Dawn</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set in a twisted reimagining of Krakow's Nowa Huta district, one of the city's districts built as a utopian ideal city meant to mirror European capitals like London and Paris. Instead of exploring the grandeur of the most populous district in Krakow, players will get to explore a ruined version of the district, its population completely decimated by a terrible plague known only as The Change, which turns human beings into horrible, mutated monstrosities known as The Orphans. Despite the current situation, humanity doesn't seem to have been left to its doomed fate, as a mysterious organization known as The Collective is sending individuals wearing massive protective armor to investigate The Change and fight off any monsters on their path. After many of these individuals have died on the path to truth, it will be up to a new Traveler to retrace their steps and rescue certain individuals from the 1980s via time rift before they succumb to the Change. After meeting The Warden, another armored individual tasked with providing members of The Collective with the tools needed to survive New Dawn, however, it starts becoming clear how there's a lot more behind The Change, the recovery of individuals from the past, and the purpose of The Collective.</p>



<p>Cronos: The New Dawn's setting and story are undoubtedly some of the best features in the game. The Polish setting is rather unique for video games, and the game's time-travel gimmick allowed for the creation of dual worlds, which are incredibly interesting to explore, although the almost constant nighttime doesn't provide a lot of visual differences between the two. With environmental storytelling in the vein of the Souls series, and scattered documents in the vein of classic survival horror games, piecing together the story and the events that happened before and during the outbreak of The Change is also quite engaging, although the game does feature plenty of cutscenes that provide clarity on some of these events and make it easy to follow the plot at its base level. With some difficult choices to make at times as well, Cronos: The New Dawn does an excellent job immersing players into the role of The Traveler, making them hunger for the next big reveal.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn's story is engaging and immersive right from the very beginning.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Having a great story that's gripping right from the start is generally good for any game, but in the case of Cronos: The New Dawn, it's even better for a particular reason: the first few hours of the game do a terrible job introducing the experience, so much so that I expect some will drop the game entirely before things start getting good. This is caused mainly by what immediately feels like a by-the-books survival horror experience clearly inspired by the Dead Space series, only with a really unremarkable enemy design, both in terms of combat and visual design, and a considerably worse combat system with no dismemberment mechanics that requires some time and resource investment in weapon upgrades to become fun. Exploration and traversal fare a little better thanks to an intricate level design, and the lack of an in-game map, which enhances immersion considerably while forcing players to rely on the environment's visual elements to find their way (although there's an optional waymarker system that guides players to their next objective).</p>



<p>Though exploration and traversal improve fairly quickly with the introduction not only of optional locations filled with much-needed resources like Energy, materials to craft items, and spare ammo as well as documents and Travelogs that provide additional information on the setting and story, but also of the Anomaly mechanics, which can be used to alter the environment by manipulating time, representing a unique way to provide additional puzzles alongside those of the more traditional variety, like locked doors and passwords to find, combat does not. </p>



<p>With their hulking armor, The Traveler is really slow and has no real defensive option, not even the ability to turn 180 degrees when needed, so proper positioning and headshots with the handgun, whose shots can be charged for extra damage, are the only things that separate The Traveler from an early death at the start of the game. With enemies not reacting a lot to shots, combat feels unsatisfying in the first few hours, dragging the entire experience down. Even after introducing the Orphans' ability to consume their dead to power up, requiring The Traveler to burn their bodies using the Shell Suit's flamethrower, things don't improve. In its basic form, the handgun is a really weak weapon, and with ammo being so scarce, every combat encounter becomes a stressful exercise where luck seems to play a bigger role than skill. Ending up with no ammo in a forced combat encounter, with no weapon to rely on other than the weak melee attacks, including a stomp that looks more powerful than it actually is, is a frustrating experience that I expect will make a few players simply give up on the game.</p>



<p>My frustration with the Cronos: The New Dawn's combat system reached its peak right before the game's first boss battle against a massive Orphan set in a small location with several rooms whose design provides the cover needed to shoot the canisters scattered around to stagger the enemy and reveal its weak points. It's during this battle, or rather after a few failed attempts, that I started appreciating what the game tries to do with its combat mechanics. Upgrading the handgun and the shotgun, deciding on the fly how to use the resources in my possesion to craft either ammo or healing items, which can be easily done without opening the menu by holding either the directional shortcut to which a weapon is assigned or the healing button, picking up some resources on the combat grounds to allow for emergency crafting, finally clicked together, completely changing my perspective on the game. </p>



<p>After obtaining the first Essence, the soul of one individual related to The Change outbreak, and enjoying a welcome passive bonus, and meeting The Warden, ammo started becoming available in bigger quantities, making it much easier to handle Orphans and manage resources, which continue to be scarce, but not as scarce as they are in the first couple of hours, although that wasn't the end of the frustration, as there still some forced enemy encounters on the way that were, sometimes, a little too challenging with the available resources.</p>



<p>As The Traveler's mission proceeds, more combat and exploration tools are unlocked, including small explosive bombs called Pyre and anti-gravitational boots that further enhance the experience a lot, so much so that I had a difficult time putting the game down. Granted, some flaws remain evident, such as the average enemy visual design, which makes it almost hard to tell one enemy type apart from another, and the generally predictable survival-horror experience, but how every gameplay element comes together in the end made it easy for me to look past most of these issues, ultimately making making me appreciate some of the game's unique quirks even more, including managing how to burn the bodies of dead Orphans to prevent a powerful enemy from becoming even more powerful, while making me forget the frustrating first couple of hours.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn takes a few hours to get going, but when it does, the experience becomes quite engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Enhancing the Cronos: The New Dawn experience are the game's visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5. While the game eventually becomes a little predictable in terms of visual design, as already mentioned, it's difficult not to notice how the good usage of lighting and volumetrics enhances the entire experience, even without hardware ray tracing. The solid visual design of New Dawn, which gives it a distinct industrial vibe, is accompanied by great texture and character models work, except for the aforementioned enemy design, which looks rather generic, and some evident asset recycling from the Silent Hill 2 remake, as the hair of one character makes really evident.</p>



<p>Being powered by Unreal Engine 5, however, some stuttering issues were expected on PC, and they sadly are in. Though the game has a shader precompilation step, which reduces shader stuttering issues, the game clearly suffers from traversal stuttering issues that, while not frequent, are easily noticeable and immersion-breaking. Given the game's visuals which rely a lot on lighting, enabling hardware ray tracing hits performance considerably, as the game ran at an average of 55 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS in Balanced Mode without Frame Generation at the high Quality Preset at 4K resolution traveling around The Terminal, which serves as some sort of main hub, on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM). At the same settings, enabling Frame Generation (and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multi Frame Generation for GeForce RTX 50 users</a>) boosts performance in the same area at an average of around 80 FPS, so using frame gen tech will be the way to go for the vast majority of players who want to experience the game with ray tracing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cronos: The New Dawn 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Balanced, Ray Tracing, Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cubXYGJWR1Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Disabling ray tracing greatly improves performance, as the game ran at close to the 100 FPS mark in the same scenario without it. Sadly, there aren't a lot of graphics settings to tweak outside of a comprehensive Quality Preset and a few others that have minimal impact on performance, like motion blur, so upscalers (TSR, DLSS, FSR 3.1, and XeSS) and frame generation are the only features that can help the user achieve the desired level of performance in the game. Though lacking in graphics options, Cronos: The New Dawn comes with others that should be the standard for PC games but often aren't, including rebindable controls, ultrawide resolution support, and a wealth of accessibility features such as multiple Color Blind modes, quick-time event settings, and more.</p>

<p>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</p>

					<h2>Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>With its by-the-books survival horror experience, its first few hours feeling more frustrating than fun due to clunky combat and average enemy design, Cronos: The Dawn seemed to be nothing more than an unremarkable survival horror heavily inspired by the Dead Space series. Push past the around two hours mark, however, and the game blossoms into one of Bloober Team's best titles to date, thanks to its quirky mechanics,, solid level design, unique setting and mystery-filled story.</p>

</li><li>Engaging mystery-filled story
</li><li>Solid level design

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-hits-clearance-level-pricing-ahead-of-new-s11-tablet-launch.1287495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>September is here and even though we still technically have a few more weeks of summer, culturally, it’s over. That’s because all the kiddos are headed back to the classroom to kick of the new school year. And with that comes tons of back-to-school sales.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet which usually goes for $220 dropped by 30%.</a> That saves you $65, bringing the price down to just $155 for a limited time. You’re getting an 11-inch touch display for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Look and Sound</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is packing an LCD screen that has a resolution of 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. The built-in speakers supply a powerful and rich sound you can hear clearly with the help of Dolby Atmos. You’re getting cinema-like sound in the palm of your hands. Alright, you and I both know a tablet isn’t producing “cinema-quality” audio. Those are Samsung’s words and even though that “like” is doing a lot of heavy lifting, it’s still quite relatively speaking when talking about tablets.</p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>At 11 inches across, the tablet is light and slim in design, yet remains durable. That makes it wonderfully portable so you can take it with you when traveling on long weekend trips, or just with you to your local coffee shop to get some work done or enjoy some reading with a change of scenery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">You have two choices or storage capacities.</a> To no one’s surprised, the less expensive model of the two is the lower capacity 64GB model. You have an option for twice that with 128GB. Storage is good for if you find yourself downloading a bunch of movies and shows, though if you’re just streaming everything anyway, the 64GB model will be perfectly suffice.</p>



<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is running Android OS which can actually have multiple apps open side-by-side at once. You can switch back and forth between different tasks or have two more tabs open next to each other for easy viewing.</p>
<p>Moving files to and from the Tab A9+ is pretty simple. Quick Share allows you to just select a file and transfer it immediately to a nearby device. That even works for phones and tablets running something other than Android OS.</p>
<p>The Samsung Kids app makes this tablet a great choice for parents who might be sharing the tablet with their children. Not every kid needs their own dedicated smart device and the Kids app is filled with a bunch of playful content appropriate for kids.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-review-a-new-harbinger-of-horror-has-merged/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cronos-the-new-dawn-review%E2%80%94a-new-harbinger-of-horror-has-merged.1287492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bloober Team is hot off the heels of its 2024 success. Cronos: The New Dawn is a brand-new IP from the makers of the Silent Hill 2 Remake, and it has everything you could want from a survival-horror game: A nervous atmosphere, a constant feeling of trepidation and jeopardy, grotesque monsters, and an inventory so limited you’re wondering if you can stuff a few more ammo clips into your suit.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> feels <em>safe</em>—and I hate using that word with new games, as it feels like an insult. It feels like a pejorative, but in many cases (this one especially) it’s a compliment. Bloober Team throws out the odd new idea here and there, but the game feels like a well-rounded survival horror title with an interesting story.</p>



<p>The game’s central enemy mechanic revolves around the concept of merging, and it feels like Cronos has dipped its hand into the best pots, aptly creating an amalgamation of tried and tested horror tropes to produce a polished and impactful debut.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Cronos: The New Dawn Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Did you pay for your fare? I don’t think so. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>You are a nameless Traveler: A mysterious figure sent to retrieve items, uncover time rifts to gain a deeper understanding of the planet’s implosion, and explore its fallen remnants in search of The Traveler who came before you. The ‘Change’ brought the world to its knees and executed it in cold-hearted fashion. All that remains is a series of monsters—each more unpleasant than the last—who merge with defeated enemies and become stronger—which is a real problem for you!</p>



<p>I found the first hour of <a href="https://cronosnewdawn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> to be a bit slow and unengaging, to be honest. You think of Silent Hill 2’s foggy and genuinely haunting opening moments, whereas Dead Space hits you with loud, blaring danger sirens as a Necromorph tries to pierce you in a tense elevator chase sequence. Any lingering doubts quickly evaporated into intrigue as the story and gameplay improved progressively. It crescendoed by the end of my 14 hours in Cronos’ hellscape, and I was truly left wanting more when the credits rolled.</p>



<p>The story feels a bit ambiguous and ambitious for its scope at times, but the final payoff is satisfying. It probably requires a second playthrough to fully grasp the intricacies of the narrative’s details, which are revealed through cutscenes and typical world-building notes and tapes scattered throughout the game’s various vile and decrepit biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-fix-what-isn-t-broken">Don’t Fix What Isn’t broken</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nope. Just nope. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played any survival-horror game before, Cronos swiftly becomes second-nature. You need to be accurate, and learning the game’s charge-up mechanic is crucial to make shots stronger and optimize ammo management. The upgrade system is a slow-burner (don’t expect to upgrade even half your gear by the time your first playthrough is done), and the pacing ducks and dives between combat-heavy encounters and exploration.</p>



<p>The game genuinely improves as it unfolds, allowing you to acquire more weapons and tools. I would’ve liked more variety in the weaponry, but your flame Tool and explosive bombs you get somewhat compensate. Cronos’ level designs range from snowy exteriors to dank, dilapidated residential buildings with monsters scuttling around every surface. You risk eternal dizziness as you need to have your head on a swivel, lest you get pounced on by an unsuspecting enemy.</p>



<p>My favorite portion of Cronos was a hospital section midway through the game—no prizes for where the inspiration came from here. Puzzles aren’t really at the forefront of Cronos’ design, but this area requires multiple keys, and special items are necessary for doors and hidden areas. The tension was palpable throughout, too. My anxiety and nervousness were through the roof as I ventured into unknown corridors and rooms, and there wasn’t enough absorption in the world to mop up my terror sweats.</p>



<p>Cronos has jump scares aplenty, and its addictive 80s synth music offsets any built-up paranoia you’re likely to experience. As much as you won’t want to, searching the vicinity is a must. Despite being advertised as a hard game, I comfortably finished Cronos with under 10 deaths—but I am well-versed in the genre. Seek out Energy, look for Cores, and your cat-like curiosity will be rewarded—there are literally cat collectibles. </p>



<p>If you’re worried there’s not enough of a challenge, a Hard Mode is unlocked at the end, along with a New Game+ setting.</p>



<h2 id="h-room-for-one-more-please">Room For One More, Please?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive journey. Credit to Bloober Team</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll flat-out say Cronos’ inventory system is frustrating beyond belief. It’s probably the most oppressive balancing act since Resident Evil 0. If you don’t focus your Core upgrades on increasing your inventory slots ASAP, you’re going to suffer. Each ammo slot doesn’t hold much, and you can never truly have a consistent balance of ammunition, weapons, and health.</p>



<p>If you find a health item out in the open, you can’t use it; it <em>has</em> to be in your inventory. The only way to drop items is to permanently discard them. You’re telling me we can have magical inventory boxes that can transfer your gear from one safe area to the next, but I can’t use a first aid pickup right in front of me?</p>



<p>You often have compulsory story items taking up slots, and I ended up not really using the game’s central burning mechanic because each flame canister—you guessed it—takes up an inventory slot. I felt punished for minimizing ammo and resource waste. Now, I think the game’s Hard Mode will be better-suited for me, and inexperienced horror fans are probably going to chew through supplies faster than a hungry mouse does a block of cheese, but veterans might get the ick from the system’s obtrusiveness.</p>



<h2 id="h-cronos-the-new-dawn-verdict">Cronos: The New Dawn Verdict</h2>



<p>The critic in me will say Cronos: The New Dawn isn’t transcendent. Again, this is ok. What Cronos does, it does very well, and taking the recency bias of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-silent-hill-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> out of the equation, I can’t recall a new survival-horror game I’ve enjoyed this much and found this immersive in a while.</p>



<p>Once it gets going, Cronos batters you with a buffet of scares, stress, and superb combat. I can’t overlook the stingy inventory management headaches that will last a lifetime, but there’s no denying that Cronos: The New Dawn wants you to think and strategize. I’ll wrap up this review by saying Cronos: the New Dawn is an excellent new survival-horror title. If you have an interest in the genre, this is a must-play, and old-school horror fans will love this: Such is our calling.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app gets a little bit bigger tomorrow, as the House of Mario revealed that the classic shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forsaken-1998/" data-ref-id="5000-103">Forsaken 64</a> will be making its way to the app on September 4. As always, this is only for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, and you'll need to have the Mature version of the Nintendo 64 app downloaded in order to play it. Forsaken 64 is actually only the fifth game to release on the Mature app, joining other classics like Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who might be on the younger side, Forsaken 64 is a shooter that first released way back in 1998 on the original Nintendo 64, as well as PlayStation and PC. It's set in the still-far-off year of 2113, where all life on Earth has been wiped out following a science experiment that caused a shockwave to hit the entire planet. The N64 version is actually unique compared to the PlayStation and PC versions--in the latter two, you play as someone trying to obtain some lost treasure, whereas in the former you play as a character trying to thwart said thieves by taking them down.</p><p dir="ltr">A big thing that sets the game apart from that era of shooters is its movement--the game has a full six degrees of freedom, meaning you can move backwards and forwards, side to side, up and down, and combinations of all of those too. You'll also be able to play in multiplayer with up to four players at once like in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">Forsaken 64 releases on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app on September 4.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[Two Major Indies Enter Xbox Game Pass This Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/02/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-1/">announced</a> the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass in September 2025, with two of the six games overshadowing the rest despite both being indie titles, as I Am Your Beast and Hollow Knight Silksong enter the subscription service.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a>, you might recall, is developer Strange Scaffold's fast-paced, first-person, parkour-shooter, as you run around individual levels eliminating everyone in your path while going for the fastest times. It was one of 2024's better indie titles from the same studio that released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546310/El_Paso_Elsewhere/">El Paso, Elsewhere</a>, the year before, which is also being made into a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://deadline.com/2024/04/el-paso-elsewhere-movie-starring-lakeith-stanfield-in-works-1235890630/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9p7T-0LyPAxVSDzQIHZXxImEQFnoECB4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zCdyhWx36_ex6-sLdn0zd">feature film</a>.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong needs no introduction at this point, with its inclusion in Xbox Game Pass being significant if you want to avoid paying its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/">$19.99 price tag</a>. That might seem like a small price to pay for what has been heralded as one of the most anticipated indie titles in the last decade, but it follows the same model Team Cherry used with Hollow Knight, which has mostly stayed at $14.99 since it launched in 2017.</p>

<p>The rest of the games entering Xbox's subscription service this week and the first half of this month include Saber Interactive's RoadCraft, RedCandleGames' Nine Sols, a game you could argue is heavily inspired by Hollow Knight. Strategy and city-builder Cataclismo, and PAW Patrol World.</p>



<ul>
<li>I Am Your Beast - Xbox Series X/S, PC, Cloud - available September 2</li>



<li>Nine Sols - Xbox Series X/S - available September 3</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - September 4</li>



<li>Cataclismo - PC - available September 4</li>



<li>PAW Patrol World - Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Cloud - available September 10</li>



<li>RoadCraft - Xbox Series X/S, Cloud - available September 16</li>
</ul>



<p>As with every month, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. As of September 15, the following three games will no longer be available in Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<ul>
<li>All You Need is Help</li>



<li>Wargroove 2</li>



<li>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/octopath-traveler-0-hands-on-way-more-than-just-a-mobile-game-remake.1287462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I can’t say I expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423">much from <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>. I’ve long admired the HD-2D role-playing game series but each new entry eventually leaves me cold. All of the pieces are there but they don’t solidify into an experience that’s more than the sum of its grindy, retro-infused parts. So I was surprised by just how much I immediately clicked with Square Enix’s latest tribute to the genre’s pixel art golden age.</p> <p>It probably helped that the demo I played last weekend at PAX West pushed me right to the brink of failure in a tough boss fight I ultimately only survived after all of my healing items were depleted and only one party member was still barely left standing. Some fans have worried about <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> being based on a mobile game that came out several years ago called <em>Champions of the Continent</em>. While Square Enix <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459">already confirmed the gacha gameplay elements</a> have been stripped out from this remake (the story has also been reworked), I can confirm, based on what I played at least, that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> doesn’t feel like an obviously <em>lesser</em> entry in the series.</p> <p>My roughly 30 minutes with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> was what anyone familiar with the old-school, turn-based RPG series would expect: I ran around town, fought enemies in a desert, and eventually made my way through a brief, cavernous dungeon peppered with treasure chests and dead ends to the boss fight within. The HD pixel art with soft focus backgrounds is still pretty and effective nostalgia bait, and the music in the section of the game I got to play was exceptional.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622694"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622694">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>But my demo did highlight two of the main features that set <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em><em>&nbsp;</em>apart from its predecessors. The first is a settlement sim mini-game in which you get to rebuild a town burned down at the start of the game from scratch. This includes both structures that impact aspects of your recovery efforts and the village’s development, like how many villagers come to live with you and the kinds of resources they harvest, as well as purely cosmetic features like cobblestone roads, trees, and benches.</p> <p>You gather materials out in the world and build stuff by placing objects on a square grid. While I didn’t get much time to play around with how these systems interact with one another over time, it’s easy to see how the settlement sim elements offer another avenue of satisfying progression that will directly benefit the rest of your party on your travels. Combined with all of the characters you’re meeting and collecting on your adventure, it all feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-1-2-hd-collection-review-rpg-features-ps1-1851767870">a bit <em>Suikoden</em>-coded</a> in the best way.</p>

 <p>Speaking of parties, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> lets you wander the world with eight instead of just four. During combat, half are relegated to a back row while the rest take turns attacking on the frontlines. Whenever it’s someone’s turn you can swap them with their buddy in the back if you need to take advantage of a different skill to exploit an enemy’s weakness or increase survivability for an upcoming onslaught. Even though they don’t get to act from the back row, these members of your party still boost the squad with free health restoration, skill points, and Boost Points at regular intervals.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000622695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622695">Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The result is combat that feels a lot busier but also more dynamic. Maybe someone in the back row has full BP so you swap them in to unleash a super attack and stun an opponent. Or you need the dancer to come out and buff the team before swapping her out with the spear guy who can target the enemy’s weakness. It speeds combat up and also creates a satisfying second layer of party management. For me it hit a sweet spot that the level of in-combat decision making in other <em>Octopath Traveler</em> games hasn’t always managed to.</p> <p>Out December 4 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> seemed like a stop-gap release aimed squarely at existing hardcore fans while they wait for Square Enix’s Team Asano to eventually deliver <em>Octopath Traveler 3</em>. But as an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>sympathizer who’s long been <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-ii-impressions-rpg-partitio-osvald-1850179725">on the fence about the series</a>, my hands-on time convinced me this might finally be the one to break my skepticism.</p>

              <p>This console generation has been notable for many reasons, from the scarcity during a covid-era launch through to the unprecedented scale of failures and studio closures, but one aspect that’s more bizarre to see than any other is the continual <em>increase</em> in prices. Historically midway through a generation we would see prices start to drop—this time, however, we’ve only seen the cost go up. And now in an astonishing move, it’s looking like Sony might be downgrading the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.</p> <p>While currently only affecting customers in Europe, the situation appears to be that the narrower PlayStation 5 Digital’s storage will be reduced from 1TB to 825GB, with the price remaining the same. That’s a price which, notably, has already been increased twice since launch. This is what’s being reported by billbil-kun on the French site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471"><em>Dealabs</em></a>, based on information from <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">certification documents</a>&nbsp;that show the next version of the discless PS5 in Europe, the <span dir="auto">CFI-2116 model, will maintain the current €499 ($580) price, but lose 20 percent of its storage capacity. This is currently only affecting the digital PS5; the version with a disc drive is as yet unchanged.</span></p> <p>That €499 price, it should be noted, is €100 ($116) more expensive than the PS5 was at launch, after two €50 increases since 2020. In the U.S., the console has also increased in price. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-tariff-sony-pro-xbox-unit-sales-earnings-1851780593">Sony warned in May</a> that Trump’s implementation of tariffs would likely cause costs to increase, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">last month that happened</a>. The PS5 Digital, which launched at $400, is now only available as the PS5 Slim at $500 (originally $450), though at least it still comes with a full terabyte of storage.</p>

 <p>Of course, any of this could change at any time. In previous generations, at around the four-to-five year mark in a console’s lifespan, we’d usually be seeing prices dropping on original builds, perhaps alongside a tweaked version at the original launch price. As such, it’s been weird enough to see this reversed, let alone then learning that new versions of the machines might become <em>worse</em> instead of better.</p> <p>825GB is far too little space in 2025. The PS5 Digital originally launched with that as its standard storage, before the “Slim” version replaced it in 2023 and upgraded things to 1TB. But given Sony’s software already takes up a huge chunk of the drive, that only leaves 667GB on an 825GB disc for your use. Given AAA games are routinely coming in around 150GB these days, you’re left with room for maybe four or five big titles? That’s&nbsp;<em>terrible</em>.</p> <p>But console manufacturers are clearly hurting when it comes to hardware revenue, given most are notoriously sold at cost or at a loss, and with tariff confusion and reality deeply hurting markets, there’s obviously a desire to shave costs wherever it’s possible. Putting the price of the console up a third time in five years in Europe is probably too big of an ask, so cutting corners could well be the next option. Which sucks. Big time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Sonic Series Producer has stated that Mario Kart World did not influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds in any way. </p>



<p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds launches this month on September 25, 2025. Ahead of the release, players will be able to try the game through an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-getting-free-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open network test</a> scheduled for mid-September. Ahead of that, the developers have revealed how Mario Kart World had no impact on their upcoming title’s development plans.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-did-not-influence-sonic-racing-crossworlds-development-plans">Mario Kart World Did Not Influence Sonic Racing CrossWorlds Development Plans</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://traxion.gg/sonic-series-producer-was-surprised-by-mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a> (via <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/09/02/sonic-team-boss-mario-kart-world-wont-have-any-influence-on-sonic-racing-crossworlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MyNintendoNews</a>), Sonic Series Producer Takashi Iizuka spoke about Mario Kart World’s impact on Sonic Racing CrossWorlds. Izuka first stated that, like everyone, they are also unaware of the “road map of Mario Kart titles” and were “surprised” when it was released. At the same time, the developers were expecting one to be released soon, as Nintendo “typically” releases a new karting title with new hardware.</p>



<p>However, Iizuka added, “Whether or not Mario Kart was going to be released, our goal was to develop the best kind of Sonic racing title. That hasn’t changed – Mario Kart World won’t have any influence.” Izuka also spoke about the differences between the two games, which include cross-play, a customizable gadget system, characters from other IPs, Travel Rings, and more. </p>



<p>He stated that these features add “depth to the racing and are something other kart racers aren’t doing.” Izuka concluded, saying, “Even though Mario Kart World was announced, it didn’t influence our development plans.”</p>



<p>In other news, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-full-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete character list</a> has been revealed, including launch, season pass, and bonus characters.

And while Helldivers 2 remains immensely popular, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani has indicated that his team has had trouble adjusting the game because the majority of players aren't offering any feedback about it.</p><p>"The vast, vast majority silently play the game--they don't post here or on Reddit," wrote Joriani on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1411450096058368114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-ceo-says-the-vast-majority-of-people-silently-play-the-shooter-which-means-the-devs-cant-just-look-at-reddit-and-what-streamers-are-saying-for-feedback-this-is-a-challenge-for-all-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>).

However, he feels that they represent "the play style of a minority," while also setting "standards for many as they have a platform to broadcast and many who look." Ultimately, Joriani indicated that Arrowhead makes changes and fixes by balancing out external feedback with "a lot of data, metrics. and qualitative data."</p><p>Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, which is apparently attributed to the influx of Xbox gamers.
