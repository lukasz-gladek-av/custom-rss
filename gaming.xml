            <p>
When was the last time you turned the radio on? I imagine for some of you younger readers, the answer is probably never. To be clear I'm not judging you here if that is the case, or even if it's just been a while, it's a format that feels hard to reckon with when its main point - listening to a range of pieces of music - is made borderline moot in the era of streaming services. All of which makes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/omega-point">Omega Point</a>, a game where you control a mech but the only thing you can do in it is change which radio station you're listening to, all the more interesting. <strong><em>A severe epilepsy warning is needed for this game as it has a lot of flashing images</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Omega Point is a new game from indie dev Cathroon, whose work you may have previously seen in <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/the-devil">The Devil</a>. A quick aside, if you haven't played The Devil, and you're desperate for a brutalist retro horror game, make sure you take a look at it alongside Omega Point. Speaking of, back to the point!
</p>
<p>
There is no protagonist in Omega Point, only you, the game starting with your body dissipating into nothingness, leaving you with no choice but to board your mech. This mech is the last surviving Doctrine, a machine that exists at "The Conjunction of Science and Religion." Once you're inside, you flick each individual switch to turn the metal giant on, eventually arriving at a timer and a message that says once it runs out, whoever is speaking will be here for you.
</p>
<p>
And after that? All you can do is explore a ruined world, and listen to the radio. There's rock tracks, chiptune, lo-fi beats, jungle, spoken word, looking at the credits there's at least upwards of 50 different songs to listen to.
</p><p>
With nothing else to do but listen to the radio, you do just that, and it makes this experience of watching the aforementioned timer count down feel a little bit less lonely. It's a curious little game that runs at just over 30 minutes (the timer itself is a full 30 minutes), so it's not a long experience, but it packs a lot to mull over in a short window.
</p>
<p>
There's that classic thing that many a mecha story does of what the pilot's relationship is to their mech in conjunction with feelings over the body. There's also the fact that even in such a desolate world, something as simple as the radio can still persist, each station sharing a small expression of itself for whoever happens upon it. A lot of big feelings for such a short run time!
</p>
<p>
A big recommendation from me for those in search of a short, punchy game that feels fitting for the times we live in. You can pick it up, for free I might add, on <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/omega-point">itch.io</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/above-snakes-review-unexpected-journey-through-wild-west</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/above-snakes-review-a-wild-west-journey-with-an-unwanted-twist.1293123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having never dived into a survival game set in the wild west, I was eager to get my hands on a console version of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="38d42f33-f793-49ff-b317-05bd4cf7961b" href="https://techraptor.net/games/above-snakes" rel="nofollow">Above Snakes</a>.</em>&nbsp;With all the vibes I was looking for, including being set in the desert, having to consistently find sources of clean water for yourself and crops, and building a sweet log cabin, I knew I wanted to see what the title had to offer. This is how I feel, both the good and the bad, in my <em>Above Snakes</em> review.</p>



<p><em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;is a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival</a>&nbsp;world-building game set in the wild west before it was tamed. It offers two modes. The story teaches you the basics, unveils what's special about the land, and unlocks new biome tiles to expand the world. For returning players or those who'd rather have a sandbox experience, all biome tiles will be unlocked in creative mode, but there's no story to play through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ability to change the design of the world through biome tiles is the best thing&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;has to offer. It costs little to delete a tile and be able to replace it, there are a number of different layouts you can select, depending on what you want, and each biome has its own unique resources to collect. The biomes blend well into each other with well-designed spaces and new enemies to encounter.&nbsp;This is what gives the game its replay value.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-trading-post.jpg?itok=-8YvJ6vx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-trading-post.jpg?itok=3MYvRm7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest issue I have with&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;is the story and how it progresses. I was ready to enjoy a full wild west survival game, complete with ranching, catching criminals with a lasso, sourcing water, and surviving in harsh environments. The game does have those elements, but the inclusion of an asteroid that turns people into Lost Souls, aka zombies, really threw me for a loop.&nbsp;Having to face the undead, whether it's skeletons, regular Lost Souls, or the giant version, took me out of the world completely.</p>

<p>The plausibility of the story is also concerning. It's set up where Aiyana and her mother are close. Her mother is where the asteroid hit, where the most damage was done. Yet, there's no urgency in getting to Corpse Creek, learning what occurred to the people there, or even sending a letter to her mother directly. People mention they fled from the town and asking after her mother isn't even a dialogue option. This was very odd to me, and every additional quest taken on added to that feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-giant-lost-soul-zombie.jpg?itok=aFdGZuJi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-giant-lost-soul-zombie.jpg?itok=Ra6rIOJr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of that, the general writing comes off as shallow. Aiyana is supposed to be part Native American, though the specific tribe isn't named. Her encounters with other tribes, especially those that say what their heritage is, are the same as her conversations with settlers. There's no difference in the way she speaks, even though there should be. The instant trust from strangers, while necessary for a game, further chips away at any remaining realism. Settlers and Native Americans were wary of each other, and strangers had to earn trust before being allowed access to people's homes and secrets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controls on PlayStation were smooth and easy to use. Mechanics were easy to pick up, and the first half of&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;felt almost relaxing in nature. Along with the bird song and soft music in the background, I found myself thinking the title was more of a life sim than a survival game. There were multiple times that I almost dozed off, partly due to the relaxing vibe and partly due to the lack of action or progress to be had at that time in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most difficult thing I came across was accurately aiming my bow. It'd often select the nearest target, including animals to hunt, instead of the one with the most aggression towards you. If you move to reposition yourself, you'll lose your target. There were many times that I'd have a Lost Soul bearing down on me and shoot a series of arrows at a tree or kill a rabbit instead. This lack of locking onto a target or prioritizing hostile creatures over can cause you to die. At the very least, I wasted a large number of arrows shooting at nothing important when in combat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-skeleton-combat-watch-tower.jpg?itok=ds4Jtf0l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-skeleton-combat-watch-tower.jpg?itok=mGgw9tX2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Many of the Wanted Board side quests revolve around defeating an outlaw or Lost Souls. General exploration has you running into skeletons, zombies, wolves, and more. Not having a fine-tuned way to target your enemies negatively impacts the battle experience. I avoided combat as much as possible due to this.</p>

<h2><em>Above Snakes Review</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;attempted to be unique with a mash-up of undead and the wild west. If this was initially advertised or included in the general information about the game, I would've had far different expectations for my play experience. Instead, I found myself wanting a traditional wild west survival experience. While my initial time in-game was easy to get the hang of and relaxing, I soon found myself frustrated by a surface-level story that didn't line up with the opening cinematic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;could be enjoyed by a specific niche audience looking for what it has to offer. That audience just isn't me.&nbsp;</p>

Earlier this year, Bungie revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion that I can still only describe now as a head scratcher. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Renegades</a>, a Star Wars inspired expansion (quite literally as it's been made in collaboration with Lucasfilm) that was shown off properly for the first time in a livestream earlier today. Oh, and there's a release date for it too!
</p>
<p>
In terms of the meat and potatoes, actual Destiny portion of it, Renegades introduces the Lawless Frontier, a new co-op game mode that sees you taking on tough missions to build up reputation. Through this you can unlock new Renegade abilities like airstrikes, turrets, a bike. But like, a fancy sci-fi bike. There's also a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, which is directly inspired by Mos Eisley Cantina, which you can see pretty easily just by looking at it.

<p>
It's a weird thing to look at. There are some of the hallmarks of a "Star War" like that not-AT-ST-Walker. Some of the guns make that classic pew pew sound effect that's been etched into the minds of every person that's ever watched a Star Wars movie. Of course there's lightsabers too, mixed with Destiny enemies that sort of look like they could be from Star Wars but not so much that they feel horrendously awkward. It's like Bungie spritzed some perfume and waited too long before they walked into it - the scent is there, but it feels like it was a bit pointless.
</p><p>
I am eternally sceptical of live service games at the best of times, and with this, even as an outsider to Destiny 2, I'm just not sure it'll do what I presume Bungie hope it will. In any case, Destiny 2: Renegades is out December 2nd, so you've not got all that long to find out if it's any good or not.

Here they are:</p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> <li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></li> <li><em>The Last of Us God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em></li> <li><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: WWII</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em></li> </ol> <p>The top spots aren’t shocking. <em>GTA 5</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> are the two best-selling game ever across any platform. <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em> is the fifth-best. Sony’s critically acclaimed first-party blockbusters also rank highly. And then it’s just a sea of <em>Call of Duty</em>. <em>Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Black Ops</em>, good ones, bad ones, it doesn’t matter, they all rank, smothering any greater sense of the breadth, variety, and whimsy of the games released on PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 over the years.</p>

 <p>“Man, this list makes me sad,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lyg7tgphcc2a">opined</a>. “Most people playing games really only play the same few titles huh.” Big sigh. Much agree. Cultural PlayStation juggernauts that didn’t make the list include but are not limited to: <em>WipeOut</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, <em>Tekken 3</em>, <em>Street Fighter 4</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Nier: Automata</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, <em>Persona 5</em>, and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p> <p>Even now, annualized <em>Call of Duty</em> sequels remain yearly best-sellers, cannibalizing much of the remaining market for big-budget console releases. I keep waiting for the wheels to fall off the Activision military shooter machine, not because the games are terrible or I want anyone to lose their jobs but because I think we have enough <em>Call of Duty</em> to last us another quarter century and I bet all of those developers could make new, original stuff that’s really cool, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The original PlayStation console launched in North America on September 9, 1995, making today, September 9, 2025, the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> of the platform in this part of the world. PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/announcing-playstation-30th-memories/">announced</a> a 'Memories' campaign as part of its 30th anniversary celebrations, but a more interesting tidbit about PlayStation's history came from Circana executive director, Mat Piscatella, who revealed that, per Circana's extensive sales tracking data, almost half of the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles for the entire platform's history are Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">posted</a> the sales chart as his own 'happy birthday' to the PlayStation platform, revealing the top-20 best-selling games on PlayStation devices in the United States for the past 30 years as of July 2025 by both dollar sales and units sold. </p>



<p>If we're looking at dollar sales, then 11 out of the top 20 best-selling games on PlayStation in the US are Call of Duty games. If we're looking at units sold, then Call of Duty games take up nine spots out of the top 20.</p>







<p>Interestingly, on the dollar sales side of the chart, the only first-party, PlayStation Studios titles to make the list are Insomniac's games from the last seven years: Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. On the units sold side of the chart, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Marvel's Spider-Man once again make the list, with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and Sony Santa Monica's God of War (2018) being the only other first-party games.</p>



<p>Another interesting entry on the list is Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock making the dollar sales side of the chart in the number 10 spot. Guitar Hero was extremely popular in its day, though surely it's the added cost of having to buy the plastic guitar controller that boosts it to its place on the list.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the top spot for both dollar sales and units sold is occupied by none other than Grand Theft Auto V. For units sold, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) make up the rest of the top five for units sold.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 make up the rest of the top five on the dollar sales side of the chart.</p>



<p>This chart is a clear example of how popular the Call of Duty series is in the United States, and that despite series like The Last of Us, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man being such key components of PlayStation's identity, they are unable to make a dent in the kinds of numbers that Call of Duty is able to pull, year after year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ironwood Studios has announced the first major DLC expansion for Pacific Drive, titled Whispers in the Woods, and it'll launch sometime later in 2025.</p>



<p>The studio revealed the expansion earlier today as the climax of a live stream it started days before, teasing players with a countdown. At the end of the countdown today at 12pm ET, the trailer below debuted.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pacific Drive: Whispers in the Woods | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cXRk1pFRgOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside its debut, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/pacific-drive-expansion-whispers-in-the-woods-launches-this-year/">PlayStation Blog</a> post went live revealing more details about the expansion, which takes players on a new journey into the Olympic Exclusion Zone that can be accessed alongside the game's main campaign. </p>



<p>Whispers in the Woods "<em>explores the rise of a terrifying group of anomaly obsessed fanatics hidden deep within the depths of the forests</em>," per the blog post and Blake Dove, communications and marketing specialist at Ironwood Studios.</p>



<p>"<em>From the very beginning, we knew we wanted to take the mysteries of the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a new direction for this Expansion</em>," added Cassandra Dracott, Ironwood Studios' creative director. "<em>We had heard so much feedback and so many stories about the fear people had experienced in Pacific Drive and in With Whispers in the Woods, we knew we wanted to lean hard in that direction.</em>"</p>



<p>There's a new narrative for players to explore that's entirely voiced, you'll also be finding and collecting new artifacts, and there will be new anomalies for you to face in the OEZ. The artifacts "<em>are the expansion’s gameplay centerpiece</em>," according to Dove. </p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by our quirk system, each Artifact is imbued with a condition and an effect said condition creates. Perhaps every time you jump, your car horn honks. Maybe when your car horn honks it also takes damage. While some may grant you strange advantages, others will add twists and turns to how you play. Artifacts can even play off of each other to create chain reactions</em>."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what artifacts add to the gameplay, and what secrets of the OEZ can be uncovered in the expansion. "<em>We see this release as both for our longtime players and a welcome sign for newcomers</em>," says Dracott. "<em>If you’ve been driving through the Zone since day one, Whispers in the Woods is going to add a brand new, more terrifying take on the Olympic Exclusion Zone. And if you’re just starting out, this expansion marks the best version of the game to date with new systems and content to find and explore.</em>" </p>

            <p>
Keep your hands at 10 and 2, drivers, as Ironwood Studios has just offered up a first look at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive's</a> first big expansion, Whispers in the Woods. Where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game has a sort of Stalker-but-you're-in-a-car kind of feel, this DLC looks like it's fully leaning into some horror vibes. The first half of the trailer has some real '70s era, found footage horror vibes, which feels laser targeted at my artistic proclivities.
</p>
<p>
It's sounding like a pretty meaty expansion too. According to the DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594760/Pacific_Drive_Whispers_in_the_Woods/">Steam page</a>, the full thing runs between 8-12 hours long, with the whole thing fully voiced, complete with new characters and "additional side narrative to discover." I'm quite fond of this ominous line describing the expansion's plot: "They have come to the Zone and left their mark. Travel into the whispering woods of the OEZ - a disturbing vision of the once familiar forests."

<p>
There's new maps and junction types to be found, some fresh parts and cosmetics to kit your car out with designed by this mysterious group, and of course more anomalies and anomaly behaviours. The big addition that's coming with Whispers in the Woods is a new gameplay system called Artifacts. These are mysterious objects that change and affect both you and the world itself, adding a bit of challenge while also being something you'll need to use to not be sent to the scrap heap in the sky.
</p>
<p>
On top of all that, there's more garage stations, route modifiers, garage cosmetics, and a new lot of music from composer Wilbert Roget II - great name by the way.
</p>
<p>
No release date on the expansion, but it is slated to arrive before the end of the year. And the base game is 50% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/">Steam</a>, so now seems like a great time to head out for a test drive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is arguably one of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">worst expansions ever</a>. Some great story beats and cool moments could not salvage one of the most disappointing loot grinds in the history of the game. Less than two months since launching, Steam concurrent numbers for Bungie’s MMO shooter have fallen off a cliff to all-time lows. On Tuesday the Sony-owned studio streamed a deep-dive into what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s last chance for a major rebound: the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion <em>Renegades</em>.</p> <p>Out December 2, the first crossover-themed campaign in the live service game’s history was originally teased back in May. Fans had been wondering just how deep the collaboration would go. Would it just incorporate <em>Star Wars</em> motifs into <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s world, or be a full-on mash-up that would bleed more deeply between the disparate science fictions? The answer is somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>“<em>Renegades&nbsp;</em>merges&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise,” Bungie wrote in its announcement. In practice this seems to mean a sci-fi Western with ties to deep <em>Destiny 2</em> lore that features lightsabers, AT-ST walkers, and lots of <em>Star Wars</em> sound effects, if for no other reason than it all sounds really cool. Also an X-Wing jumpship that is literally just an X-Wing.</p>

  <p><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> will revolve around rising through the ranks of the criminal underworld in a Mos Eisley-like outpost called Tharsis as players confront a new Cabal faction called the Barant Imperium. You’ll perform jobs for competing syndicates to curry favor and unlock new gear and options as the difficulty, rewards, and chaos keep escalating. Following the Drifter’s lead and going rogue, <em>Renegades</em> will ultimately try to tie things back to the mystery of The Nine that kicked off <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s current Year of Prophecy.</p> <p>There’s a lot of ideas that sound interesting, and fun mechanics like a very <em>Helldivers 2</em>-coded option to call down ammo crate drop pods that kill enemies in the process. And there’s also a lot of <em>Star Wars</em> stuff like the lightsaber, which is actually a new weapon called the Praxic Blade that players will collect and customize the parts for across the <em>Renegades</em> campaign and the upcoming dungeon. There will be different colors and even the ability to deflect incoming fire back at enemies like in the movies.</p>

 <p>Will all of this fit together in a way that feels exciting and natural and not like a licensed cash-grab that only further dilutes the mystery and mystique around the <em>Destiny 2</em> universe? I have my doubts. Would I like a mercenary-themed <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign about navigating competing factions and featuring non-linear mission progressions? Absolutely. Do I want to play a <em>Star Wars</em> MMO that functions like a shooter? Hell yeah. Do I want those things thrown into a blender? At this point, definitely not. Hopefully <em>Renegades</em> can prove me wrong.</p> <h2>Fixing <em>Destiny 2</em> starts with<em> <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Ash and Iron </span></em></h2> <p>Today’s mini-showcase was also the latest milestone on Bungie’s “fix <em>Destiny 2</em>” tour which continues with the free <em>Ash and Iron</em> update. It brings back the <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Plaguelands from the original </span><em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and adds a new three-player activity called Reclaim, about golden age tech and the Vex. There’s lots of new gear, more lore drops around Maya, and an event coming later called Call to Arms that will see Devrim Kay finally leave his European Deadzone bell tower. There’s a new exotic mission coming as well with Iron Banner, Festival of the Lost, and more that will be detailed in an upcoming roadmap.</p>

 <p>More important are the fixes Bungie is promising leading up to <em>Renegades</em> in December. The studio wants to make the current power climb faster and improve overall rewards from activities. There will be upcoming buffs for supers and subclasses, alongside a pause on nerfs and balance changes as Bungie tries to right the ship. The “road to <em>Renegades</em>” will begin with making the loot chase more rewarding across the entire game, especially in raids and dungeons and for fireteams of three taking on the hardest activities. The proof will be in how that actually gets implemented, though.</p> <p>Bungie is still trying to tinker around the edges of its new systems implemented in <em>The Edge of Fate</em>. It could be an improvement, or it could lead to even more convoluted overlapping systems that foster bad incentives and boring activity loops. <em>Destiny 2</em> is at the point where it needs drastic overhauls that make it more fun but also much simpler. With 10 years of storytelling wrapped after last year’s <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion, it feels like <em>Destiny 2</em> needs to be content with becoming a casual session-based game rather than a weekly second job and build from there. There’s plenty of interesting stuff coming down the road, but I’m not yet convinced hitting the <em>Star Wars</em> button will be enough.</p>

There are over 1000 pocket monsters now, and odds are that each of them is somebody’s favorite. The series’ most popular critters, like mascots Pikachu and Eevee, tend to take up most of the company’s merchandise, so the Sitting Cuties plushes ensure that everyone has at least one piece of merchandise for even the most obscure little guy by creating a sitting plush of each Pokémon. They’ve been released in waves over the past seven years in order by generation. Today, The Pokémon Company released the Alolan line, meaning we’re now seven out of nine generations in. At this rate, there will be a Sitting Cutie for every Pokémon in the next couple of years. However, this good news also comes with some bad news: TPC is sticking with the inflated price.</span></p> <p><span>The Alolan Sitting Cuties are </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/sitting-cuties"><span>available to order on the Pokémon Center website</span></a><span>, but they run you $16.99. These plushes were notable for being really affordable back in the day, with the original price being $10.99, but the price jumped in 2023. You can still find old plushes for the original price, but they’re almost all marked as sold out. If you can get past the sticker shock, the Alolan Sitting Cuties are pretty cool, but it’s a much harder sell to get people to buy multiple plushes in each drop, as the cost adds up much more quickly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Generation VII has some of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s most elaborate designs, and the Sitting Cuties squish them into a tiny, chibi form that can sit on your desk or shelf, so it’s a challenge to get massive creatures like the Ultra Beasts to fit the visual identity of the line. Nevertheless, they’re still pulling it off. From a design standpoint, it’s interesting to observe how the Sitting Cuties manage to condense these bigger monsters into something that is roughly the same size as Pikachu. If you want to see some of the highlights, click through. Otherwise, try to get your Alolan fave before they sell out or some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>scalping asshole</span></a><span> grabs them.</span></p>

                <p dir="ltr">After several years of plundering Lost Sectors to kill pumpkin-headed bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players will have some new spooky activities to complete when this year's Festival of the Lost rolls around.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie mentioned a few changes coming to Destiny's yearly Halloween event during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">Renegades expansion</a>. Alongside the yearly drops of themed cosmetic armor and special weapons, developers mentioned both a new six-player PvE activity and a three-player PvP activity.</p><p dir="ltr">The six-player activity is called Haunted Altars, and according to Destiny design lead Clayton Kisko, it sees the Headless Ones--huge Halloween-themed boss monsters who sport pumpkins where their heads used to be--finally escaping from the Lost Sectors where they've been holed up for previous festivals. As for the PvP activity, it's called Red Rumble. Bungie didn't provide any details as to what the activities will actually be, but they should shake up the formula of raiding Lost Sectors, which has been the mainstay activity since back before the release of the Beyond Light expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">This year also sees the return of "hocus-focusing," which allows you to pick the loot you'll receive during the event. You'll need Eerie Engrams, which drop from Festival activities, and Candy, the currency you'll get throughout the Festival of the Lost period. Hocus-focusing allows you to receive specific weapons from the Festival loot pool, or to grab Exotic gear, as long as you have the Candy to pay for it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's Festival of the Lost armor for 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside a few new details about Destiny 2's Halloween celebration, Bungie also showed off this year's Festival of the Lost cosmetic armor ornaments, which are themed around pop-culture killers. Players voted between armor sets themed on Slashers and Specters back in January, but it seems as though Bungie combined elements of both groups into the final armor set.</p><p dir="ltr">Hunters can grab armor themed around the look of a ghostly bride (which also blends in some of the Ghost Face-esque look inspired by the slasher from the Scream movies); Titans get a look inspired by hockey mask-wearing murderer Jason Vorhees of Friday the 13th; and Warlocks can dress up as a creature akin to the internet's favorite tall spindly faceless child-stalker, the Slenderman.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, those armor ornaments will be available through the Eververse Store for Silver, Destiny 2's premium currency--so don't expect to earn them through gameplay.</p><p>Bungie ran down lots of details about Renegades during the livestream, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-power-grind-should-get-less-grindy-in-renegades-expansion/1100-6534592/">changes it's making to Destiny 2's loot and Power grind</a>, based on player feedback.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during its latest livestreamed reveal presentation, Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 and its four different models: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-17-officially-announced-with-four-new-versions/1100-6534588/">"impossibly thin" iPhone Air</a> has grabbed headlines, each member of this new generation of iPhone features a pair of new tech additions that mobile gaming enthusiasts will particularly find interesting.</p><p dir="ltr">First is the new Super Retina XDR display, which not only features the Ceramic Shield 2 for better protection, but will also support ProMotion up to a 120Hz refresh rate. NetEase's free-to-play RPG Destiny Rising has been confirmed to be among the first iOS games to utilize the 120Hz tech.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616"></a><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next is the vapor chamber cooling technology, which was also a feature of the Xbox One X. This cooling tech is designed to "enhance heat dissipation and performance" thanks to deionized water sealed inside the chamber, which is "laser-welded into the aluminum chassis to move heat away from the powerful A19 Pro, allowing it to operate at even higher performance levels," according to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/" rel="nofollow ">official announcement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gaming-relevant features found in the new set of iPhones include the A19 Pro chip, which sports a 6-core CPU and GPU architecture that Apple says will "deliver up to 40% better sustained performance than the previous generation." The new N1 wireless networking chip, meanwhile, will support Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread for online multiplayer games.</p><p dir="ltr">The iPhone 17 in all of its forms is set to launch September 19, with preorders scheduled to begin one week prior on September 12.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie debuted the first major look at Destiny 2's coming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, today during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwlUS_JcarQ">a live stream event</a>. It also unveiled and launched the latest update for Destiny 2, Ash &amp; Iron, which is the first major update to the game's current Year of Prophecy.</p>



<p>Renegades was first unveiled earlier this year when Bungie hosted a live stream event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest Destiny 2 expansion that released this past July. Renegades is still planned for release later this year on December 2, but ahead of that launch, we got our first look at gameplay for Renegades, and just how closely it looks to Star Wars, complete with lightsabers, Imperial-style walkers, Star Wars-sounding blasters, and X-Wing fighters.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Renegades, players will delve into 'The Lawless Frontier,' which will include a series of high-risk, high-reward contracts that'll have players undertake smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage missions that can be completed solo or with a full squad.</p>



<p>The missions will take you to one of three planets across six maps that all have a Destiny foundation with a new Star Wars coat of paint to them. It's all part of how Bungie is weaving Star Wars through Destiny in this expansion.</p>



<p>Besides the new Lucasfilm digs coming in Renegades, Bungie also launched the Ash &amp; Iron update today, which has Guardians travelling back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny game.</p>



<p>There's a new three-person fireteam activity to complete, and the rewards pass for Edge of Fate has been given a refresh along with today's update. A new raid will also be added on September 27, with the epic raid for The Desert Perpetual going live.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">Pete Parsons</a>, the now former studio head, left the company and went into retirement after 23 years with the studio. He wasn't studio head for that whole time, but he has been the studio head for all of Bungie's recent woes in the last decade, since he took the role in 2015.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7b1cf58cf8e2/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been putting a procession of 8BitDo controllers through the review process since Switch 2 launched. I've covered their excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">Pro 3 controller</a>, whilst Ollie has been all over the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">Arcade Stick for Switch + Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">Ultimate 2C</a>, which is the budget-friendly version of what I'm taking a look at today - the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless.</p>
<p>First and foremost, for anyone who doesn't gel with the shape of the Pro 3 controller, what you've got here is one that suits those lovely, soft, Xbox-controller-shaped paws you've developed over the years. I know for some this can be a dealbreaker, especially with how the thumbsticks sit horizontally aligned on the Pro 3, so if that has been holding you back, this may be the pad you're after. Things under the hood aren't showing a lot of difference otherwise.</p>
<p>Indeed, my main positive talking points remain much the same as with the Pro 3. 8BitDo has put a lot of emphasis on having the latest tech in its gear recently, and here we once again get all the big 2025 buzzwords from the exciting world of controllers. TMR sticks make the cut — a feature which still usually sees the cost of a controller rocket — and they are a joy, giving you the smoothest sticks around with all of that fancy magnetic magic that goes into making them free from the bane of stick-drift.</p>

<p>For the triggers, we're looking at snazzy Hall Effect magnetic jobs, too. So you've got all the quality included with regard to sticks and triggers, exactly the same as with the Pro 3, which makes for a solid core. The d-pad sticks to the same style as the Pro 3, too, chunky and responsive and sitting out nicely as it clicks through all of its input points.</p>
<p>Sticking with similarities between this and other 8BitDo products, the number one drawback is, of course, that these controllers don't have the ability to wake the Switch 2 up. There have been some rumblings that they're working on a solution, and the pad received an update to make it compatible with Switch 2, so this is something we could see down the line, as some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/admin/edit/news/2025/08/gulikit-launches-new-budget-controllers-with-switch-2-wake-up-support">manufacturers have already managed it</a>. However, for now, I feel like I'm capping review scores for pads that make me walk to my console to an 8 out of 10. Not out of laziness, you understand; it's a function that simply should be there.</p>
<p>If you can make peace with this — if you can somehow work around the pain of turning the console on "manual-style" — well, there isn't really much more for me to follow up with in terms of negatives. If I had to get picky, NFC support isn't there (something that doesn't interest me at all, but it will do some), and I feel as though the extra programmable 'L4' and 'R4' shoulder buttons up top make the pad a tiny little bit clicky and less solid in form than it could be.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel bad at all. In fact, it feels much like the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller 2 from Nintendo</a>, and even beats it out in having nice grippy textures on the back of the pad, but they can occasionally feel a bit loose in comparison to the rest of the inputs. You do get a total of four programmable buttons out of this, mind, with two paddles on the grips, so all in all, a very minor issue.</p>

<p>The Hall Effect triggers can be switched between regular and macro-switch modes and there's some snazzy RGB lighting in the rather unfortunately named "RGB Fire Rings" around the bases of the sticks. I'm not a huge RGB guy, as hard as it may be to believe, but these are fine in my opinion - they give off a warming glow and can be switched on and off and cycled through colours and modes via the 8BitDo software available from their site.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of this software, you need to update the controller, should you pick one up, in order to have it work on Switch 2, so be aware of this and know that you'll need a laptop or whatnot to connect for a small download. Once in the 8BitDo app, you can also then set your lighting to whatever colour you want, switch it off, have it follow and change colours to your touch, and so on.</p>
<p>When both your dongle and controller have updated via the app, you can then connect to the Switch 2, just make sure to hold down Y and the power button when powering it up and you should be connected.</p>

<p>This controller also comes with a big brutalist charging dock, which I have to say I kinda love. Just like the Pro 3's base, here you find your all-important USB-C receiver tucked away in a compartment, and the dock has the same slick little bar of light running along its underside, which is a lovely detail in a darkened room.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, and with regard to battery life, I drained my controller in about 14 hours, and I believe I could have got a bit more out of it if I had turned off the RGB. So, word of warning, it's not the very best battery out there, and those lights make it ever-so-slightly worse.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in terms of specs and price point ($59.99 / £49.99), features, comfort and design, it's all gravy, even if the budget 2C wins in the value department. Yes, it could be easier to update, there's a tiny little bit of clickiness out of the 'L4' and 'R4' buttons, and the battery is weaker than I'd like, but overall this is still a premium-feeling pad, stuffed full of the latest wizardry, at a reasonable price compared to some competitors.</p>

			<p>A new datamine from <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1964735415929229504">RivalsInfo on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/marvel-rivals-could-soon-be-getting-loot-boxes-1598643/">GameReactor</a>, points to Marvel Rivals getting a new kind of addition in Season 4 that's not a new set of characters joining the roster, a new map, or balance tweaks. It's loot boxes, though in-game, NetEase seems to be calling them 'Mysteries.'</p>



<p>RivalsInfo discovered the loot boxes, codenamed under 'Mysteries,' in a datamine for Season 4, but that doesn't exactly mean they'll be arriving in a few days' time when Season 4 launches on September 12, 2025. It just means that they might be coming in a future update, even if it's not the next update. </p>



<p>"<em>In Season 4, logic for the 'Mysteries' player component was reintroduced</em>," RivalsInfo writes. "<em>'Mysteries' is the codename for loot boxes. Within this component, there are multiple references to mystery box logic, such as "cosmic mysteries number" and "BOX_OPEN_HISTORY_CHANGE", which further confirms that it relates to the old loot box system. The image below shows what it might have looked like when the logic was still in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Loot boxes could be coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarvelRivals</a> at some point in the future:</p><p>In Season 4, logic for the "Mysteries" player component was reintroduced.

</div></figure>



<p>As RivalsInfo points out, even if they are introduced, it's not exactly definitive that they'll only be available if players pay real-world money for them. They could also be acquired through gameplay, as is the case with multiple free-to-play titles that have similar systems.</p>



<p>If NetEase does introduce loot boxes, then it'll be interesting to see how it handles their monetization, and reward structures. It could easily create a similar issue that many other free-to-play games deal with, having high-tier rewards locked behind the gamble of acquiring them through loot boxes.</p>



<p>Though if players are vocal enough against them, they might not be introduced at all, or at least altered, or removed entirely, if NetEase realizes it's more of a hassle to have them if players really don't want them.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s loot grind is getting some major changes in its next expansion, including adjustments to make more activities more rewarding and to make gear more viable in the game's new Portal activity scoring system.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced several of the changes in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ?si=ZeoppwP1tjmrSn4-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming Renegades expansion, noting that many of them are responses to feedback from players in the wake of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion. Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with balance changes and adjustments, Bungie also detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">what's coming in the Renegades expansion</a> and mentioned some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-festival-of-the-lost-is-getting-new-activities-check-out-the-armor/1100-6534597/" data-ref-id="1100-6534597">changes to Destiny 2's Halloween event</a>, the Festival of the Lost--and showed of this year's spooky armor sets.</p>
