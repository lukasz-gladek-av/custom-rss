            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-motorsport-games-earnings-report-reveals-grim-outlook/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Motorsport Games’ latest earnings report has revealed a grim outlook for the future of the company. Despite reducing costs and increasing general revenue for the third quarter of 2024, the company is still facing a significant uphill climb to continue.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/static-files/dac01c29-57fd-4ad6-a3dd-04e22275663b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earning’s report</a>, Motorsport Games saw a slight increase in revenue of $1.8 million. That’s a $0.1M increase in year-over-year revenue. The company did have a net loss of $0.6 million for Q3 2024, which is an improvement compared to the $3.5M net loss from Q3 2024. That said, despite some improvements, there is a concern from the company regarding its ability to continue forward.</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, Motorsport Games has just $0.5M in cash with “no assurances” that they can find the liquidity and investments needed to continue.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future,” the company said in its report. “Accordingly, our financial condition raises substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.”</p>



<p>The company’s current deficit sits at $86.3M as of September 30, 2024, and they still owe $0.6M for the 2021 purchase of Studio 397. They are set to lose the ability to sell their NASCAR video games on December 31, 2024 as part of the deal that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the NASCAR license</a> to iRacing. It was also said that the company expects to receive a letter of deficiency from the NASDAQ regarding its compliance for a continued listing.</p>



<p>Even with the concerns, CEO Stephen Hood said that the company will continue the work towards turning things around.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to see an improvement in several key financial performance indicators, highlighting that the business is now in a stable position for the next phase of growth,” Hood said.</p>



<p>This is the latest development for a company that has seen its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-turmoil-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">share of turmoil</a> and issues over the last couple of years. Most recently, they<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-suffers-more-layoffs-as-struggles-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid off more staff</a> while announcing its plans to consider “strategic alternatives” for the company.</p>



<p>“[The] Motorsport Games board of directors and I are in the process of reviewing the options available to us with a view to improve our long-term funding needs in order to produce the great game experiences we have proved that we can offer under our new business structure,” Hood said. “The number of expressions of interest received serves to reinforce our belief in the opportunities ahead.”</p>



<p>Should the company not be able to gain additional investment, they have listed a number of potential alternatives ranging from selling assets and reducing staff further to “discontinuing operations” entirely. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games is currently operating on a reported $100,000 monthly burn rate after multiple cost-cutting measures. For the year, they are sitting at a negative cash flow of $0.7M.</p>



<p>For now, the company continues to work on updates to its simulation racing title Le Mans Ultimate. The latest update in September saw the introduction of a new co-op mod, stave states, and more. There is also a new update coming in December that will add GT3 cars to the game.</p>

<p>I’m no stranger to genuinely odd and, occasionally, terrifying first-person shooters that make you scratch your head—for instance, Vladik Brutal or Cruelty Squad. But today’s release is something for the history books. 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition—yeah, that’s the game’s full title—hereby known as 420BlazeIt 2, is a trippy first-person shooter full of memes and rather tight gunplay. It’s immensely fun!</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Gameplay Reveal Trailer Game of the Year 420 Blaze It 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUI6Oc1BQgE?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare yourself for the long awaited sequel. You will blaze it. You will no scope. You will see some weird af s*** as you fight and xD in 999fps to destroy the Illuminati and rescue the memes. Are you ready for 420BLAZEIT 2????!!1</p>



<p>Normal Wholesome Games is a studio dedicated to one goal: never do what the player expects.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Well, they’ve certainly achieved that goal. I think at one point when Illuminati Mecha Sherk dabbed on me before exploding and falling backward into his swamp, whatever I thought this game was going to be went out the window.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With a 10% launch discount that lasts until November 21, you can grab this whacky FPS on Steam for under $10. For you achievement hunters out there, 420BlazeIt 2 features a staggering 94 achievements to unlock as you progress deeper into the Illuminati rabbit holt. </p>



<p>Furthermore, and rather unsurprisingly, while only a handful of Steam user reviews are currently live for the game, they’re all positive and relatively glowing. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-thrones-sophie-turner-reportedly-in-talks-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-tv-series<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider TV series might have found its Lara Croft. Following reports last month that Sophie Turner was in the running to play the iconic character, it's now being claimed the Game of Thrones' actor has reached the negotiating stage.
</p>
<p>
A live-action Tomb Raider series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-best-look-yet-at-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-animated-series">Netflix's animated adaptation</a>) was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">first reported</a> back in January 2023, with Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge attached as writer. It wasn't until May this year, however, that Amazon <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/prime-video-tomb-raider-series">made the series official</a>, confirming Waller-Bridge's involvement and not much else.
</p>
<p>
Since then, curious minds have started pondering the obvious question: who might Amazon cast as Lara Croft following Angelina Jolie's memorable live-action turn as the jet-setting archaeologist in the early 2000s and, later, Alicia Vikander's more grounded approach to the role. Then, last month, it seems like an answer could be near, with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/tomb-raider-sophie-turner-lucy-boynton-lara-croft-1236161243/">Deadline reporting</a> Sophie Turner (perhaps best known as Game Of Thrones's Sansa Stark) and Lucy Boynton (Mary Austin in Bohemian Rhapsody) were both poised to test for the part.

<p>
And it looks like Turner may have clinched it; Deadline has followed its earlier story with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-amazon-1236173978/">claims</a> the actor is now "in negotiations to star as Lara Croft". So assuming all goes well, Turner could soon be joining the elite club of actors who've played the iconic role either on or off camera.
</p><p>
The Tomb Raider TV series - which Amazon has previously referred to as "epic" and "globe-trotting" - doesn't have anything close to a release date yet, but it'll air on Prime Video when it eventually shows up. In addition to the series, Amazon is also set to publish <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">Crystal Dynamics' next Tomb Raider game</a> and is even planning a new movie instalment. And if that's still not enough Lara for you, Apsyr is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-the-worst-reviewed-tomb-raider-games-is-getting-the-remastered-treatment-and-i-am-here-for-it">releasing Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</a> next year.

The latest guest character is Ghostface from the <em>Scream </em>movies.

The main Ghostface you play as has been transported from the movies to the <em>MK </em>universe. And this is where it gets interesting because according to Brownback, this singular Ghostface killer then partners up with two people from Kano’s Black Dragon Clan. </p><p>In the video Browback called the two helpers “Black Dragon Enforcer” and “Black Dragon Assassin” and explained that these aren’t random anonymous characters, but that the devs actually know who they are.</p><p>“I know who they are...but one of the fun things about <em>Scream </em>is the whodunnit aspect,” said Brownback. </p><p> “You shouldn’t figure out who the killer is till the third act reveal. So for this stream we’re not going to name any names. It’s up to you to look at the clues, the Easter eggs, and maybe try to figure it out for yourselves. Argue amongst yourselves.” </p><p>Brownback didn’t reveal the characters’ identities because that would “very much go against the spirit of the <em>Scream </em>movies.”</p><p>So who are the masked killers in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Kira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perhaps Kira</a></span>, a lesser-known character from the PS2 era of games that loves knives and is kind of wacko?<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Jarek#Mortal_Kombat_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Maybe Jarek</a></span>, who is a very strong brute that you might describe as an enforcer and who has been referenced already in <em>MK1</em>? I assume fans and<em> MK</em> nerds will figure this out within hours of the characters being available. </p><p> Ghostface officially joins <em>MK1</em>'s roster on November 26. However, if you own  the Premium or Kollector’s Edition of the fighting game, you can play as the killer as early as November 19. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those objects include the basketballs you can toss around spawn points in Control matches which, these days, serve little purpose but letting you try to score a basket or two before the game starts. However, back when you could attach Symmetra’s turrets to them, you could then knock them out of the spawn area and into the battlefield. The turrets lock on to foes and fire high-damage beams at any nearby enemy, which means that if you have several of them attached to a basketball, you can knock the ball of death near enemies and watch it drain their health in seconds.</p><p>It’s fun seeing how much of <em>Overwatch</em>’s refinement over the years has sanded away some of the funny and chaotic strategies players once utilized.

Up to this point, developer Compulsion Games hasn't said much about what the actual gameplay of South of Midnight is, so I was eager to check the game out when the studio offered a chance to see it in action. The demo was on the shorter side and, unfortunately, was hands-off, so I still don't know how it feels to actually play South of Midnight. But from what I saw, the game most reminded me of my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>--South of Midnight looks like an action-adventure game from the PS2 era: a far cry from Compulsion Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/contrast-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-136280">Contrast</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/we-happy-few/" data-ref-id="5000-439978">We Happy Few</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In South of Midnight, you play as Hazel, a woman whose home of Prospero is hit by a hurricane. Learning she's a Weaver, a magician-like person who can unravel the corruption affecting a place and suture the fraying ties of the community, Hazel sets off in search of her mother who was washed away during the storm. Hazel can use her magical weaving abilities to tear apart enemies, acrobatically flip through platforms, and solve puzzles. Each major arc of the story sees Hazel uncovering the legend surrounding a creature--sometimes an animal, other times a person--that has achieved larger-than-life, otherworldly status as their past traumas twist them into mythical monsters. Upon deducing how these creatures became what they are, Hazel is tasked with defeating them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> South of Midnight Gameplay Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The setup looks a whole lot like Bridge of Spirits, with Hazel's efforts to explore the trauma and backstories of the creatures that threaten her home resulting in the area being cleansed, much as Kena fought off the Rot and the lingering spirits of the traumatized individuals left behind. And like Bridge of Spirits, South of Midnight takes nods from a culture not often explored in video games--just in this case, it's the American South instead of Bridge of Spirit's Bali (a small province in Indonesia).</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, South of Midnight looks like a modern-day take on the same type of gameplay Bridge of Spirits built on: that of the action-adventure game from the mid-2000s. The demo I watched saw Hazel use combos to take down mobs of enemies, platform between landmarks, complete optional challenges to unlock collectibles, and take on a larger-than-life monster in a boss fight. Again, I have no idea how the game actually plays, but in practice it looks familiar; it looks like a type of game I've played and enjoyed before. What I'm most curious to see is how the gothic-fantasy themes and Deep South setting inform the world design because that--for me, anyway--is what's going to set this game apart from its contemporaries.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399830"></a><figcaption>Hazel is a Weaver, using magic that emulates the act of weaving thread.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399830-weaver.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Where the South really influenced the gameplay was mostly across three things," game director Jasmin Roy told GameSpot. "It was the world itself, how we were going to go through various regions that have different biomes, which means in level design, and different spaces to navigate--all these buildings that are abandoned, things like that. And we went like, 'It would be cool to be able to jump on [buildings] and move around and do things. And that combined itself with magical realism--how you're going to have powers to interact with the fantasy element of the settings. And when you combine those two things together, you start going, 'Okay, I'd like to be able to jump, move, use the strands, manipulate objects, create objects with that fantasy of everything being this traditional arts and craft of weaving.' And then the third thing I know that really influenced [the world] was the mythical creature, folkloric, the giant thing. So that informed how we built the world and how we created mechanics to go around them."</p><p dir="ltr">Roy described South of Midnight as a more linear experience, with the player moving forward from one area to another. "The region informed all the rest [of the game]," Roy said. "And that's how we ended up creating a feature set and the gameplay loop and how it works. That's why we think it's a unique journey and it's all built as a journey. So you are asking, 'Oh, is it the same gameplay loop?' It does fluctuate because it is narrative-driven. So most of the time with the creature, it will play out with, 'Oh, I need to learn their story to go on.' But there are also other different beats of narrative events that will happen because dealing with creatures and regions is not the only thing you'll do in the game to progress. There are other events to be discovered once you get the game right."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399831"></a><figcaption>Two-Toed Tom is a crocodile whose past has transformed him into a monstrously large creature.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399831-twotoe.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Some of the [gameplay] loops do repeat, so I just want to make that clear," studio head Guillaume Provost said. "The experience [of meeting] the creatures pass through multiple beats and [culminate with] filling your bottle--those are loops that do repeat themselves that you do recognize throughout the game's structure itself. But to Jasmin's point, you don't always fight the creatures--there's no fighting. There are different types of encounters that you'll get throughout the game that kind of celebrate different beats that have to do with the story and/or contact your problem that the creatures are going through."</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of [the creatures] are going to focus on traversal," Roy said. "Some of them even focus on narrative beats. It really is a mixed bag. Some of them will evolve into direct confrontations, like we saw with the demo today. But there are other features that do focus on traversal. We have some of that, and we also have some that focus on that. I don't want to reveal them too much because I really think they're really cool. But yes, the idea was that even though the loop was going to be about experiencing their story and interacting with them and beating them, depending on which type of creature you're going to encounter, fighting wasn't always the right word. [Fighting them isn't] always the right thing because [the creatures] do have wildly different stories of things that happen to them."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4399829"></a><figcaption>Some of the mythical creatures Hazel encounters were once human.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4399829-larger-than-life.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"You as a player are there to resolve their trauma or help move past the situation that they're in," Provost continued. "So in certain cases, when it made sense from a narrative [standpoint], structural point of view, there is a combat sequence. For example, when Two Twod Tom eats your house, you get really angry. There's a setup for it that creates the conflict. Hazel, the main character, is not roaming around trying to kill mythical creatures. That's the key takeaway. When there is conflict, there's conflict that's instituted for a narrative construct and reason that makes sense. But in other cases, there are problems with the creature that don't involve conflict. It's better resolved either through narrative [choice] or puzzle-solving or platforming or other types of challenges that actually have to do with specifically the issues of that creature."</p><p dir="ltr">How the studio spoke about trauma was the one qualm I had about the game at the event, given how often "resolve" and "fix" were tossed around. The preview event didn't include an example of how Hazel would do this and the developers were vague on the subject, but I'm always wary of folks talking about trauma as an easily fixable issue when it's regularly an ongoing process. And taking into account that South of Midnight is taking inspiration from the Deep South, a place of long-lasting intergenerational trauma that rarely is just addressed and "fixed," I'm looking at this specific part of the game with an air of caution. Admittedly, the rest of the event showcased that Compulsion has shown a tremendous amount of respect and care toward other aspects of the American South in terms of ambiance, landmarks, music, and language--South of Midnight sounds like a trip to the Deep South--so it's just as possible that the studio has handled the themes of trauma with similar care and simply isn't ready to showcase how those storylines play out yet.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="396580572" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Midnight's mythical creatures and stories of trauma. "They're folktales; they're more universal. In this world, they're legends that [Hazel] ends up coming across after she starts her journey. And then the more she sees, the more it stops becoming surprising for her, and that's the magic-realism angle. Whereas after she leaves the most grounded area, which is where she's from, this little town, her home, and she starts going into what we call the focal arc of the Deep South, and she starts meeting these characters and communities, those people just accept these creatures around them. And those creatures, their story is really tied to the land, to the history of that land. And they would have more, I guess you'd say, high-level allegorical messages behind them, if that makes sense."</p><p dir="ltr">Having now seen a smidge of what South of Midnight has to offer, I'm mostly excited--I loved Kena: Bridge of Spirits so another game akin to that is right up my alley--but I do have some worries about the story that I hope to see addressed. South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/xbox-marketing-campaign<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Xbox revealed a new marketing campaign titled “<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Is an Xbox</a>,” a strategy that focuses on calling various things that are not Xboxes Xboxes in an effort to… well, I hope not sell Xboxes.</p><p>This is all most briefly summed up by an energetic 30-second video that includes many objects, only one of which is an Xbox. See if you can figure out which one!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Xbox - This Is an Xbox" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Senior Director of Xbox Marketing Craig McNary wrote of the campaign in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a></p><blockquote><p>This Is an Xbox invites people to play with Xbox across multiple devices and screens. It showcases the evolution of Xbox as a platform that extends across devices, with bold, iconic, fun visuals and a light-hearted tone.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>(As an editor, I will respectfully stand aside on the capitalization choices here. OK, no I won’t: I would either have done “This Is An Xbox” or “This is an Xbox.” Anyway!)</p><p>The campaign includes branding on busses and billboards globally, partnerships with brands like Crocs and Porsche, and a merch store where you can buy clothing that says “This is not an Xbox” (true: it is clothing) and phone cases that say “This is an Xbox” (false: it is a phone.). There’s even a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/what-is-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quiz</a> that I find offensive as a person with an <a href="https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">educational background</a>, which marks you wrong if you correctly identify things that are clearly not Xboxes as not being Xboxes.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>No, this is a Meta Quest headset. You can tell by the logo, and the fact that it's a headset</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, I get what Xbox is doing here. The company has been moving away from being a console with exclusive games <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-playstation-ps5-exclusivity-indiana-jones-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a while now</a>; as Luke wrote, “The past decade of Xbox's existence has been marked by a general impression the company has no strategy or clear idea what exactly it wants from video games.” Through its acquisitions of studios and companies, putting its games on other platforms, and its <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">messy leaning in</a> to subscription services and cloud gaming that make owning its console less essential (and, I’d argue, even make its subscription offerings less desirable), this new campaign is just the next phase of a clear evolution away from the idea that Xbox is best defined by being, well, a box. It’s not a bad strategy when you consider the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/xbox-series-xs-sales-are-reportedly-less-than-half-of-the-ps5s-with-microsoft-on-track-for-a-repeat-of-ps4-vs-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s sales numbers</a>, and I’d even go so far as to say that anything that threatens to end the idea of the “console wars” once and for all should be considered a public service.</p><p>But it’s kinda weird, right? I am no marketing genius, despite owning a company, but my <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year of experience</a> has taught me that brand recognition is important. And part of people being able to recognize my brand is clearly communicating what that brand <em>is</em>. I’m not sure that calling Meta headsets, Samsung TVs, and Amazon Fire Sticks “Xboxes” does quite what Microsoft thinks it does, given that those are <em>already</em> brands. If the purpose of a marketing campaign is to get me to buy something, I come away from this not exactly sure what I’m supposed to buy: another company’s TV? An ASUS handheld? Maybe this is best seen as a way for Microsoft to claim a stake in existing brands and say no, actually, these are <em>my</em> brands now, like that “Dressed To Kill” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTduy7Qkvk8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flags</a> sketch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All piss-taking aside, the campaign’s essential incoherence <em>does</em> coherently express the <a href="https://x.com/Serrels/status/1810883333909307440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> around Xbox these days. It feels less like a sales pitch and more like the worst kind of captcha, but I won’t say that isn’t how being on the internet and also generally being alive feels these days, so maybe Xbox is just fully embracing the zeitgeist. Best of luck to all involved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-game-studios-announces-diplomacy-era-of-empire-now-available-for-pre-order<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em>. The latest installment in this iconic board game of political machinations will put players in the role of a 19th-century world leader, adding a monarchal twist to the game's established rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/employ-skillful-diplomacy-and-cunning-tactics-in-diplomacy-era-of-empire/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is a complete stand-alone experience for new or experienced players. During a game, players take the role of one of seven world leaders during the 19th century. This includes Britain, France, Russia, Turkey, China, Japan and the Netherlands.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diplomacy-era-of-empire-game-board.jpg?itok=ood8wXGP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diplomacy-era-of-empire-game-board.jpg?itok=y0nAVNNz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there, players must negotiate and outwit one another in a balance of cooperation and competition to gain dominance of the region. Like classic <em>Diplomacy,</em> players must rely upon their own cunning and cleverness to conspire and conquer. No dice rolls are going to save you here. The game is designed for 2-7 players and a single game takes roughly four hours to complete.</p>

<p>For <em>Diplomacy</em> veterans, this version of the game will contain original twists to the established formula, keeping things interesting. Just be sure to inform new players that the betrayals aren't personal.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is the first unique spin on a classic board game by Renegade Game Studios. It is a continuation of the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing partnership</a> with Hasbro to reprint classic board games. It is a partnership that has included <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/robo-rally-transformers-crossover-game-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Roborally Transformers</em></a>, and a <em>GI Joe</em> <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em> game.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is available for pre-order right now on Renegade's store page. It is being sold at an MSRP of $50 and copies are expected to ship in September 2025. A copy of the game will include the following:</p>

<ul><li>A gameboard</li>
	<li>147 Double-Sided Country Tokens</li>
	<li>84 Wooden Army Tokens</li>
	<li>84 Wooden Fleet Tokens</li>
	<li>7 Zip Bags for Storage</li>
	<li>A Rulebook</li>
	<li>Map Pad Containing 20 Sheets</li>
	<li>Quick-Start Rules</li>
</ul><p>Please note that the MSRP does not take shipping costs into account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-york-game-awards-2025-andrew-yoon-legend-award-to-sam-lake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The New York Game Awards officially announced today that industry giant Sam Lake will be the latest recipient of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award. Sam Lake is the Creative Director of Remedy Entertainment, the mastermind behind titles such as Alan Wake and Control. By receiving this award, he will be joining the rank of those who received it prior to him, which includes Hideo Kojima, Tim Schafer, Todd Howard and many more.</p>
<p>In case you aren't caught up on Remedy Entertainment or Sam Lake, he has played a significant role in creating some of the most iconic game franchises out there, including Max Payne, which was released in 2001, to Alan Wake in 2010, a title that received a sequel in 2023.</p>
<p>"What an honor it is to celebrate someone of Sam Lake's caliber during the 14th annual New York Game Awards. You know a Remedy game when you see it, largely due to Sam Lake's impact on the worlds he creates. It's really cool to see how his 20-year career at Remedy has touched so many of our members and interns at the Circle, and we are thrilled to have him join the roster of esteemed game changers previously recognized with the Andrew Yoon Legend Award," says Harold Goldberg, President and Co-Founder of The New York Videogame Critics Circle.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sam-lake-receives-andrew-yoon-legend-award-new-york-game-awards-alan-wake-control-remedy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with IGN</a>, Sam Lake sat down to discuss his feelings about the nomination and Remedy's legacy, as well as some of the upcoming plans for the game studio going forward:</p>
<p>"It's been close to 30 years now. Video games are a form of expression and art. I feel the exciting thing is that there is no set form or kind of street set of rules. We are still a very young medium that keeps on finding new ways and keeps on evolving."</p>
<p>When it comes to Remedy Entertainment in particular, the studio has most recently been working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-whos-the-real-monster/">Alan Wake II DLC</a>, which also provided a bit of a teaser for Control 2, another piece of the Remedy Entertainment Universe puzzle. While there is no set date for Control 2 as of yet, it is a highly anticipated title and is bound to show off more of Lake's and the rest of the team at Remedy's greatness.</p>
<p>For those looking forward to the New York Game Awards, you still have a little while to wait. The 14th Annual Show will be taking place on January 21, 2025, live at SVA Theatre. This is an event that you can attend in person or watch live on YouTube, depending on your preference.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the longest time, you could only find me using Steam. I wouldn’t touch another digital storefront or launcher if I could help it, but GOG inevitably won me over. Now, I have a growing library of classic titles, such as Jade Empire, The Suffering, and World in Conflict—all classics in their own right. Well, it turns out their offerings continue to improve. GOG is launching its game preservation program to ensure titles like Fallout and Resident Evil remain available and functional for players years after release.</p>



<p>As of this writing, the program features 100 unique titles, with an average rating of 4.2 out of 5, and more than 500 game improvements implemented by the restoration team at GOG. Some of the titles in the program include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Theme Hospital</li>



<li>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</li>



<li>SWAT 4</li>



<li>Empire Earth</li>



<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>



<li>Diablo + Hellfire</li>



<li>System Shock 2</li>



<li>Dungeon Leeper 2</li>



<li>MYST</li>



<li>Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete</li>



<li>Jagged Alliance</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Origins</li>



<li>Demonicon</li>
</ul>



<blockquote>
<p>The GOG Preservation Program ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems, even after their developers stopped supporting them. By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support.</p>



<p>In a world of rapid technological change, we see the urgent need to save video games from vanishing. The GOG Preservation Program is committed to keeping beloved classics alive and playable for future generations.</p>



<p>Our goal is for all games, whether recent or classic, to eventually become part of the Preservation Program. For a game to qualify for the Program, our team must run it through many quality tests. If these tests fail, our team updates and improves the game until it matches our quality standards. Only then, we stamp the game with our Preservation Program and grant it Good Old Game status.</p>



<p>There is a long backlog of classic games available on GOG that may already qualify for the program, but our team has not been able to confirm that yet. We aim to support as many games as possible, but it’s not always entirely up to us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To this end, GOG recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/original-resident-evil-joins-gog-sequels-coming-later-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the Resident Evil bundle</a>, featuring the first three classic survival horror titles in a single, functional package that allows modern gaming computers to run and play smoothly. But that’s not the end of the road for the preservation program, as the team intends to add hundreds more titles to the program by the end of 2025, but not before thorough quality assurance checks clear each game.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a>' harrowing side-scrolling survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> is ten years old today. And to mark the occasion, 11 Bit has unveiled Forget Celebrations, a new charity DLC being released as part of the game's continuing "mission to shed light on the civilian cost of war".
</p>
<p>
"Innocent lives are still being lost on battlefields, new conflicts are erupting, arms production escalates to feed war's demand, and civilians and soldiers continue to face unimaginable brutality," the studio writes in its announcement of Forget Celebrations. "With the world bleeding, we believe it is vital to keep pushing for change."
</p>
<p>
In Forget Celebrations, 11 Bit once again returns to the fictional war-torn city of Pogoren, this time to tell the story of Katia, a seasoned war correspondent. "While struggling to write a book on the brutal realities of war," the studio explains, "a missile attack devastates her home, forcing her into an even harsher fight for survival and the recovery of her gathered material."

<p>
11 Bit hasn't announced a release date or price for This War of Mine's Forget Celebrations DLC as yet (and it's so far only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323700/This_War_of_Mine_Forget_Celebrations_Charity_DLC/">confirmed for Steam</a>), but it says all studio proceeds will be donated to its charity partners - War Child, Amnesty International, Liberty Ukraine, and Indie Games Poland - in the "hopes of helping those affected by today's ongoing wars".
</p><p>
This War of Mine has been met with significant acclaim since its release back in 2014, appearing in London's Imperial War Museum and New York's Museum of Modern Art. It was <a href="https://11bitstudios.com/this-war-of-mine-is-set-to-be-added-to-the-core-curriculum-of-polish-schools/">officially added to the Polish school curriculum</a> in 2022, and  was even awarded a Special Recognition Award by Amnesty International earlier this year for its "continued relevance in portraying the harsh realities faced by civilians in conflict zones" and as a "powerful reminder of the crucial importance of international humanitarian law in protecting civilian lives in areas of armed conflict, citing current situations in various regions of the world."
</p>
<p>
In his review of This War of Mine back in 2015, former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robinson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-review">wrote</a>, "[Its] simple message - that war is hell, and that we're all capable of being sucked into its moral depths - might be slightly compromised by its strengths as a game, but at least it's a message carried with a great deal more conviction than other, more bombastic portrayals of conflict. That, for certain, is something to be thankful for."

			<p>At long last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a> has been updated with a proper 4v4 player versus mode where players can choose from the Five Heroes and the Pactsworn to go against each other in fierce battles.</p>
<h2>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 Versus Mode is live with new challenges and rewards</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-adds-dlss-3-and-fsr-2-2-more-dlc-coming-after-siennas-necromancer/">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>,&nbsp;</em><span>released in 2018, has today received the<em>&nbsp;Versus Mode,&nbsp;</em>which will provide players with a new way to enjoy the game. The developer and publisher Fatshark has released the Versus mode with&nbsp;<strong>a </strong></span><strong>4v4 </strong>player mode along with several new features.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Versus is a </em><strong><em>free new Game mode</em></strong><em> for Warhammer: Vermintide 2! It’s an asymmetrical PvP+E experience pitting up to 4 Heroes against our AI enemies and up to 4 Special players, what we call Pactsworn. A match will take place over several rounds, with each team swapping places between playing the Heroes and the Pactsworn each round. To simplify, each round consists of the Hero team playing a regular game akin to Adventure mode, while the Pactsworn players, controlling the Specials, have to stop them.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The co-op title usually allows players to join a team and go against the enemies, but with the 4v4 Versus mode, players can enjoy even more challenging gameplay. Players can choose from the <em>Ubersreik Five Heroes</em> and for the first time, the&nbsp;<em>Pactsworn&nbsp;</em>characters are also available to play with, allowing players to use unique abilities.</p>
<p>The Pactsworn is comprised of&nbsp;<em>Skaven&nbsp;</em>and <em>Rotblood Tribe, </em>which are the in-game enemies introduced after the conclusion of Vermintide 1. Each team can choose the characters from either Five Heroes or Pactsworn to go on a rampage against each other and unlock new challenges and rewards.</p>
<p>The maps from the PvE have been reimagined for PvP. Each character from the Five Heroes will have three careers to master, and throughout the course, they will offer players new progression systems containing new challenges and rewards, which are exclusive to the Versus mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Versus PvP Mode | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lpzON3pVSO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The developer has promised to offer another free update. This will be the&nbsp;<em>Verminous Dreams&nbsp;</em>DLC, which will contain three levels. The first level will be released on December 9, followed by the other two in early 2025. The DLC will be available across all platforms, including PC, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.</p>

I assume it will be the usual mix of dueling egos and knowing video game dunks, but hopefully there’s some more trenchant, contemporary criticism mixed in. <em>Mythic Quest </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855">still has one of the best jokes</a></span> about gaming ever made. </p><p>For those who haven’t yet taken the plunge on Apple’s video-game-flavored riff on shows like <em>Community</em>, it’s about the charming but dysfunctional studio behind a hit MMORPG in the mold of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and the ways they self-sabotage one another while working through their personal foibles and attempting to grow past their character flaws. It’s a perfect example of Apple TV’s narrow, lowkey success with original programming that is very good and almost nobody is watching. People can start remedying that in the meantime by catching up on seasons 1-3. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Creature-collector games have never looked like this before, but I hope it's a blueprint for the future.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The creature-collector genre is a space first and foremost dominated by Pokemon, then filled out with many games inspired by it. Lots of kids who grew up on the massively popular IP via the card game, anime, and its many video games are today developers looking to add their own spin on the format--some of them to modest or better acclaim, like TemTem, Cassette Beasts, and Palworld. I enjoy such games, but most of them tend to be uninterested in achieving a vision of a game I've had in my head for years--to no fault of their own, of course. It's <em>my</em> vision, not necessarily theirs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beastieball/" data-ref-id="5000-590692">Beastieball</a>, a new creature collector from Wishes Unlimited--the team behind heartfelt indie darlings Chicory: A Colorful Tale and Wandersong--seems serendipitously built from the ground up as though its studio read my mind. Finally, there's a Pokemon-style game that consciously washes its hands of some of the genre's more uncomfortable implications of animals.</p><p dir="ltr">I've written about the intersection of animal rights and gaming before, and many readers who previously overloaded my articles with negative comments were, from one perspective, right on the money. Where one may be concerned with animal rights, they need not extend their concern to virtual animals, since these are not living beings. To that, I both previously offered and once more render a resounding <em>duh.</em> But it's never been my point to argue for the liberation of Pokemon, Pals, or, in this case, Beasties.</p><p dir="ltr">Rather, my focus remains on <em>portrayals </em>of animals in games. How we present ideas through our media often affects how we view similar subjects in the real world, even if we can't always sense the changes taking shape. If I watch a lot of movies, read a lot of books, or listen to a lot of podcasts, all espousing a particular point of view, how long will it be until I start to believe it's true in real life? One needs only to look at how YouTube algorithms or the "manosphere" have, in many cases, Roganized a generation of (usually) white guys. My concern with how we gamify animal exploitation is not centered on freeing virtual animals from their imaginary shackles; it's about hoping to promote portrayals that reject the tropes we so often see in games--where animals are little more than crafting resources, transportation vessels, and supply chains. If we reconsider how animals are portrayed in games, it would have a knock-on effect in real life for some number of players. That's how progress happens, and Beastieball is a sure sign of it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782" data-ratio="0.56063618290258" data-width="1006" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399782"></a><figcaption>The simple change from dogfighting to volleyball erases a lot of the genre's typical, more awkward implications.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399782-screenshot2024-11-12175309.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So as to not bury the lede here, I'd enjoy Beastieball for much of what it does, even if it did those things the way Pokemon or any other major creature collector game does them. But by making a concerted effort to harmonize its story universe and its gameplay mechanics, it's revealed an exciting new, animal-friendly path ahead for games like it. None of this means you should feel bad for liking Pokemon. At the same time, it feels really good to like Beastieball.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon's central mechanic is its turn-based combat system, which has been around for so long that it can be easy to overlook that it's essentially in-universe dogfighting, a practice few would endorse in real life. There's long been debate about whether or not the creatures actually like fighting each other the way they're made to when captured by human trainers. Some say they enjoy it, and only resist capture so that the trainers can prove their worth. This doesn't seem to be in the text, but even if we accept it as true for the sake of discussion, the fact that a mistreated creature can't choose to leave their trainer suggests these creatures are closer to indentured servants than companions.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon does gift some of its prominent creatures with personalities--Ash’s Pikachu most of all, of course. But for the most part, the series' lovable monsters are defined only by their breed. The story is naturally focused on Ash and his entourage of Pokemon trainers. It's a story of human triumph in which the creatures are tools to achieve a goal. Beastieball goes to great lengths to ditch all of these notions and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780" data-ratio="0.56107249255214" data-width="1007" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399780"></a><figcaption>Beasties form bonds and unlock additional moves during their volleyball matches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399780-screenshot2024-11-12174625.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For one, its turn-based combat system is recontextualized as volleyball. It's said that the Beasties adore the sport, and they'll actively seek out trainers with whom they can tag along to meet other Beasties and play volleyball--called beastieball in-universe. There's no hint of Beasties causing harm to one another. Such a simple reimagining of the genre's key mechanic can help players of all ages, but especially younger, often more impressionable players, experience a creature collector that doesn't require the cognitive dissonance of believing you both love your creatures and eagerly send them into street fights.</p><p dir="ltr">Given how Pikachu is both Ash's companion animal and fiercest soldier, this depiction breaks down quickly. Pokemon asks us to accept that this is just how its world behaves. Fair enough, I suppose--the series has never been too concerned with self-reflection--but even better is <em>not</em> asking that of players, which is what Beastieball does.</p><p dir="ltr">Beastieball goes beyond just that, though. The entire world of the game exists in harmony with this example; it's clear that slight alterations in the genre's tropes were consciously made to get away from them. Beasties who play together a lot can become close friends and teach each other moves, and this process is depicted with the pair gleefully meeting for an epic celebration that expresses love and appreciation. Rather than force a Beastie into a Poke Ball-like object, they can be recruited via you discovering their unique recruitment conditions, like winning a game in a certain way or performing specific moves. And the Beasties you recruit trail behind and beside you, freely joining in on your adventure, like dogs on a walk rather than pets locked in a crate.</p><p dir="ltr">As you fill out your Pokedex-like Beastiepedia, details are filled in that often have nothing to do with gameplay mechanics. These short biographies feel heartfelt, as though their writers mean to celebrate the animals for their traits and personalities the way a museum would. It's not all there to help you dominate your competition and beat the game. A lot of it is pure enrichment via lore that sees its starring critters as unique beings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781" data-ratio="0.5609514370664" data-width="1009" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399781"></a><figcaption>Townsfolk view their Beasties as companions, not belongings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4399781-screenshot2024-11-12174638.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even people around the open world will remark on their Beasties in such a sweet way. A woman I met early in my travels went on about how she feels her bird-like Beastie is unique from others in their family, and explained how that is. Beasties aren't merely tools or even breeds. They're individuals, each of them spoken of not as "it," like a chair or a doorknob, but "he," "she," or "they," like beings with their own wants and needs.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite such similar story structure and gameplay mechanics to Pokemon, Wishes Unlimited's game disposes of the parts that require mental gymnastics. Though you still want to be the very best (like no one ever was), to catch them is not your real quest. Its story is actually about saving a Beastie habitat from closure, and the adventure you go on is all in service of returning to your town with the resources to save a space that means so much to the local people and Beasties. This is not a tale of conquest; it's a story about community.</p><p dir="ltr">This has long been a genre where we often, consciously or not, ignore the uncomfortable implications of a story's universe. But Beastieball proves you can have it both ways. In the broader sense--the one that will ultimately determine the game's staying power--it's an awesome creature collector that will surely scratch the Pokemon itch so many never quite satisfy. But by bringing the studio's now-trademark air of emotional sincerity and attentive kindness to a genre where it's often lacking, Beastieball is the creature collector I always wanted but wasn't sure I'd ever get.</p>
