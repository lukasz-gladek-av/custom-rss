            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, and it'll offer information on Switch games coming to the console throughout the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), tomorrow's Direct will offer "roughly 40 minutes" of info on Switch games coming this year. It'll air tomorrow at 10am Eastern (that's 7am Pacific).</p>
<p>One thing that tomorrow's Direct decidedly will not offer, however, is information on the Switch's successor; the X post states clearly that "there will be no mention" of whatever the Switch 2 turns out to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-direct-june-2024.jpg?itok=PnrwoSye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-direct-june-2024.jpg?itok=RE06QGdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>be featured during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct? Time will tell.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we already knew that the Switch 2 wouldn't be making an appearance during this summer's Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Back in May, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">promised a Switch 2 announcement</a> sometime before April 2025, but he also said that announcement wouldn't be made during the summer Direct.</p>
<p>As such, if you're hoping to hear about whatever comes after the Switch tomorrow, you'll be disappointed, but that doesn't mean the Direct won't have lots of info for you. The Switch has plenty of games on its 2024 slate, after all.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2024, releases like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed"><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>are set to launch on Switch, and we'll presumably hear about some games we don't already know about as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch-nintendo-direct.jpg?itok=Dj3KlJe7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch-nintendo-direct.jpg?itok=aow9c6f7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to delve back into&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2&nbsp;</em>next week?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, no discussion of a Nintendo Direct - or, indeed, of any presentation nowadays - would be complete without one thing, so let's acknowledge the elephant in the room, the specter that haunts all gaming discourse.</p>
<p>Will we see&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>during tomorrow's Direct? It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">been a while</a> since we heard anything concrete from Team Cherry about the game, after all, and a <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">classification in Australia earlier this year</a> sparked fresh rumors that a release date might be imminent.</p>
<p>Let's not get our hopes up, though. There are plenty of games out there to get excited about without worrying about&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, even if its absence is causing me pain on a daily basis. Check back tomorrow for everything that's revealed during the Nintendo Direct!</p>

            <p>
The perpetually scarlet-faced and jovially maladroit folk of Embracer have done their usual vaudeville comedy routine of spinning around with negative-dollar signs in their eyes and trampling on another game development studio - in this case, Pieces Interactive, creators of the recent Alone In The Dark reboot. The Swedish studio's <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/">website</a> is now a tombstone, bearing the dates 2007-2024. Oopsy-daisy!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pieces were acquired by Embracer in 2017 as part of a decade-long acquisition binge which came to a rude halt in early 2023, when the reported collapse of a multiple-billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal obliged Embracer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">cut their operations to the bone</a>. In the past financial year, Embracer have given over 4500 employees the chop, closed 44 studios - including Volition and Free Radical - and binned off 80 projects. Among the subsidiary organisations that have survived the cuts are Gearbox, which Embracer have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-borderlands-devs-gearbox-to-rockstar-parent-take-two-for-460-million-in-shares">flogged to Take-Two</a>, and Saber Interactive, which Embracer have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">sold to a new company launched by a few of Saber's original founders</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In late March, Embracer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">grandly announced</a> that they were done throwing studios into the sacrificial volcano, but evidently, there's always room for one more. In late April, Embracer revealed plans to divide their remaining tabletop gaming, free-to-play and premium video game businesses into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">three smaller organisations</a> that are focused on specific markets and platforms and which, crucially, do not have the word "Embracer" in the title - all presided over by the investment firm run by Embracer CEO and cofounder Lars Wingefors.
</p>
<p>
Nu-Alone In The Dark aside, Pieces were the creators of Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice, Leviathan Warships, Robo Surf and Kill to Collect across PC, console and mobile. They also worked for hire on several Magicka DLCs and Magicka 2, together with Titan Quest expansions Ragnarök and Atlantis. I wasn't that familiar with their work before writing this, sadly, but I will always raise a flagon of goodwill to anybody who's done anything Magicka-related. Here's hoping all those affected by the closure find their feet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-back-half-2024-announced-june/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The June “Not E3” season has almost come to a close, following big shows from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Keighley</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation</a>, and more, but one more straggler still has to show us their wares – Nintendo. Switch owners have been eagerly awaiting a Nintendo showcase of some sort, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-nintendo-direct-this-week-journalist-claims-said-to-air-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors flying one would be arriving soon</a>, but the company itself has remained mum on the prospect. Well, today Nintendo finally lifted their veil of silence, announcing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> for tomorrow, June 18.</p>
<p>Nintendo has specified that the show will focus on games coming out in the back half of 2024, and will run around 40 minutes long, making it fairly meaty by Nintendo Direct standards. What we won’t see is any information about Nintendo’s successor to the Switch – that’s likely coming later in the year or possibly even in early 2025.</p>
<p><em>“Join us for a Nintendo Direct livestream focused on Nintendo Switch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.”</em></p>
<p>As for what might be shown during the Nintendo Direct, as always with the company, it’s hard to say, but we can do some educated guessing. It seems quite likely we’ll finally get a first real glimpse of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>, as I suspect that will be the Switch’s final big holiday game before Nintendo moves on to new hardware. There have also been various <a href="https://wccftech.com/known-leaker-backs-years-long-zelda-twilight-princess-switch-port-rumor-while-possibly-mentioning-new-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of Zelda remakes and remasters</a> floating around, and even talk that Star Fox may be coming back in some form.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Direct goes down tomorrow (June 18) at 10am ET. So, excited to see what Nintendo has been cooking up? What do you hope to see? Personally, I would temper expectations somewhat – again, the original Switch only has about half a year still in the spotlight, so there’s only so much they can announce for it. Still, as long as we finally see Metroid Prime 4, I’m happy.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-review-right-tool-for-job</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-review-%E2%80%93-the-right-tool-for-the-job.903369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-review-right-tool-for-job<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to beloved toy properties, <em>GI Joe</em> is synonymous with vehicles and tools. It is inextricable from the series' military fantasy roots. The right men with the right tools at the right place ready to stop evil. To that end, <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is a natural sourcebook for the franchise's RPG outing.</p>
<p>This book is a decent supplement given its small page count. It provides new player options and a solid swathe of GM tools, covering larger-scale campaigns. While some of those rules are given more attention than others, the book as a whole is essential if you want to get more out of your games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-unit-camp-artwork.jpg?itok=1XwOBfGu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-unit-camp-artwork.jpg?itok=G2V0O9p6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, how do you figure out what gear is available here?</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Gi Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is 127-page <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/essence20-field-guide-to-action-adventure-review">Essence20</a> supplement for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-roleplaying-game-review"><em>GI Joe Roleplaying Game</em></a>. It contains new player options, including new Origins, Influences, and Role Focuses for both Joe and Cobra PCs. It also contains brand new weapons, weapon upgrades, and vehicles pulled from across the franchise's history.</p>
<p>Lastly, it contains helpful GM rules and resources, including alternate rules for equipment requisition, setting campaigns in different time periods, as well as optional rules for vehicle-focused scenarios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-vehicle-upgrade-screenshot.jpg?itok=1KUJ6sm5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-vehicle-upgrade-screenshot.jpg?itok=cVizWedX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Got attached to your MOBAT? Now you can upgrade it.</figcaption></figure><h2>What New Equipment Options Are Introduced in<em> GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>Out of <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear's</em> five chapters, two of them are completely dedicated to new gear and vehicles.</p>
<p>In keeping with <em>GI Joe'e</em> army aesthetic, these weapons and gear upgrades are a blend&nbsp; of plausible military kit and sci-fi weirdness. There are rules for strobe attachments, ergonomic grips, and concealed weapons for covert ops. Upgrades that sit alongside stats for piezoelectric explosives, molecular reducers/enlargers, and (no, really) the mythical sword Excalibur.</p>
<p>As for defensive options, this supplement introduces a new battledress option: body armor. Functionally, body armor provides temporary health for your character. Given that Essence20 is a low-health system, that extra point of health can mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
<p>What makes body armor even better is that it can complement any player loadout. Any PC can take and equip two forms of battledress as long as one is body armor. Better still, body armor has dedicated traits and equipment. Kevlar vests, thick leather jackets, even complex bodysuits made of experimental supermetals are all available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-influence-screenshot.jpg?itok=s7Zrp-nS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-influence-screenshot.jpg?itok=pvEeCe22 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There is even an influence on going analog. And it is amazing.</figcaption></figure><h2>What New Player Options are in <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>In keeping with <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide To Gear's</em> emphasis on equipment, the new player options are tech-centric. The Leadfoot Influence gives you bonuses in high-speed vehicle chases. The Futurist Origin provides free equipment for you and your squad and lower high-end gear requisition skill tests. The general perk Destructive Overcharge lets you turn certain weapons and kits into ad-hoc explosives.</p>
<p>But the biggest tech influence comes from the new Role Focuses. The Chameleonite Commando uses nanotech to change their appearance, making them master infiltrators. Drone Pilot Infantry gets a drone that increases utility and power with the player. Tech Officers are experts at coordinating team tactics with on the field tech savvy. Notably, they can treat Driving and Targeting skills as Smarts and Speed Essence skills. Disruptor Rangers are master saboteurs and survivalists, capable of exploiting gaps in enemy battlements. Freebooter Renegades are modern-day pirates and privateers. Highly situational, but devastating on their home turf.</p>
<p>Neutralizer Technicians are battlefield hackers, capable of disrupting important tech and rapidly disassembling complex electronics. Lastly, Strafer Vanguards combine their powerful defensive shields with low-altitude air support.</p>
<p>Generally, if you know your campaign is going for a technothriller vibe, these Role Focuses are a perfect fit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-armadillo-screenshot.jpg?itok=eQGavTa0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-armadillo-screenshot.jpg?itok=tQiceWPx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to break out the big guns.</figcaption></figure><h2>What New GM Tools Are In <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>The <em>GI Joe Roleplaying Game's</em> gear requisition mechanic is a wonderful translation of characters getting ready for a mission. Assessing what will be necessary, planning ahead with some general tools, or requesting something disruptive or explosive just in case. It is James Bond getting gadgets from Q or the <em>Mission Impossible</em> crew planning a heist in TTRPG form.</p>
<p>As it stands in the core rules, it can be limiting for GMs. As exciting as missions and campaigns can be, the system falls into familiar beats. Briefing, exposition, make requisition skill tests, deploy, play out mission. What if players deploy deep behind enemy lines, scrounging for equipment <em>Metal Gear</em>-style? What if players want to upgrade their tools, making their kit an extension of their character?</p>
<p><em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> provides these alternative rules and more. There are rules for swapping out requisition skill tests for a requisition budget, letting players buy gear for a mission. There are rules for equipment requisition by division. Is your character's service background in Demolitions? You automatically get certain weapons, consumables, kits and battledress associated with that skillset.</p>
<p>The most mechanically dense is the <em>Metal Gea</em>r-esque long-term deployment rules. They include charts and skill tests for scavenging and repairing gear based on size and time constraints.</p>
<p>Overall, these new requisition rules are great. They can help either speed up or add extra granularity to certain missions and campaigns as well as limit or expand player options. Want to do a GI Joe take on <em>The Great Escape</em> or <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>? The tools are here.</p>
<p>As for new vehicle combat rules, they are light but effective. These range from accounting for 3D vehicle movement to adjusting battlemap size for vehicle-focused encounters. One of these variant rules I find most creative is Group Specialization Tests. If a team is all manning a vehicle and want to perform a complex maneuver that uses different skills, the driver rolls a D20 and the teammates roll their respective skill dice, treating the entire test as a specialized roll.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-historical-period-excerpt.jpg?itok=Ob-JUVC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-historical-period-excerpt.jpg?itok=9o66AFic 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>History is a great resource for entertainment. This is no different.</figcaption></figure><p>The biggest idea in <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is the chapter dedicated to different time periods. Mechanically, it may be the most threadbare section of the book. It discusses historical technological advancement but provides few suggestions for how that tech can be expressed in-game.</p>
<p>The research cited is all compelling, and the book addresses potential changes to the contents of field kits and battledress. Just don't expect transformative charts and rules if you're planning on having the Joes and Cobra duke it out in WW1 or the Cold War.</p>
<p>But if you're a fan of far-future adventures, the supplement has you covered. There are rules and suggestions for cybernetic enhancements and nanomite infusion powers.&nbsp; These range from technoswarms that can disintegrate objects to active combat and defense bonuses. There are even futuristic Threats in the chapter, all of which illustrate how dangerous nanotech can be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-vehicle-combat-artwork.jpg?itok=oe1HoD4b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-vehicle-combat-artwork.jpg?itok=dVF1Gy9H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buckle up, this is going to get bumpy.</figcaption></figure><h2>Should I Pick Up <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide To Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>While it is low on pages and uneven with its content, <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide To Gear</em> is a solid supplement. It streamlines and expands some of the game's more complex rules while giving players and GMs plenty of material.</p>

<p>The tone that Peterson wants to set for this book is set early in his Foreword, "No book published today could hope to give a complete picture of the making of D&amp;D." Peterson cites issues with the 'fragmentary evidence' from its early periods, fanzines that are notoriously difficult to work with, and the very nature of Gygax and Arneson creating a lot of this game in collaboration not only with one another but with their players and being influenced by external resources.</p>

<h2>You Can Start At Anytime</h2>
<p>The story of <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> begins with Gary Gygax, a "32-year-old high school dropout, married with five children." Working as an insurance underwriter with a passion for wargaming and high fantasy fiction.</p>
<p>At this point in his life, he's already hosted the first Lake Geneva Wargames Convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. This convention is what fans of Board Games and TTRPGs call GenCon.</p>
<p>This book takes us through the journey of Gygax's initial inspirations as well as the different players who were taking different rulesets, iterating on them, or merging them with other games to create all-encompassing systems.</p>
<p>After being taught how Gygax's Fantasy Supplement was adapted to better fit Black Moor, you get to see how Black Moor's updated rules were fed back to Gygax to allow the process to continue to expand.</p>
<h2>Then And Now Aren't So Different</h2>
<p>I was enthralled reading about how 'wild west' the landscape was as systems like <em>Chainmail </em>and <em>Braunstein </em>were getting handwritten updates or fan-made companion rulesets back during the early days of TTRPGs. So many stories are told of different gaming groups or cities having variations on rule sets because they fit the play differently.</p>

<p>It's also impossible not to compare how things were to the current landscape of the TTRPG space, now boosted by the power of the internet.</p>
<p>Gygax submitting supplements about dragons or a homemade <em>Fantasy Supplement</em> to expand on the setting options isn't all that dissimilar to the kinds of zines that indie RPG creators are making or expansions/updates for first-party <em>D&amp;D</em> published content that is sold on websites like DriveThruRPG.</p>

<p>The most impressive aspect of <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> isn't in the text recounts of events. A lot of these you'll be able to find in any other in-depth history of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. What makes this book so special is that after getting a few paragraphs of text about the <em>Chainmail Fantasy Supplement </em>or the <em>Greyhawk </em>supplement you'll then be provided with scans of the entire document.</p>
<p>Every page you open up to gives the sense of being able to look at a document behind a plexiglass enclosure at what would be a museum of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, while the written text is a bit more akin to the plaque that you'd see on the side.</p>
<p>Examples of the supplements are incredible, but some of the real gems in this book are draft copies of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> including pages describing the different Cleric levels by experience with Gygax's handwritten notes scratching out previous level names and replacing them with new ones.</p>

<p>These kinds of printouts do take up the majority of the space within the book, the first draft of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> stretching from page 84 to 182 only to lead directly into a Twin Cities draft as well as the Mornard fragments.</p>
<p>If you are after that narrative history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> where a concrete story is woven with edited first and secondhand accounts then this might not be the book for you, but if you want to see the exact documents that were being used to run RPGs fifty years ago or even the handwritten correspondences between Gygax and Arneson this book is a treasure trove.</p>
<p>This 'museum' like approach to providing readers with high-quality scans of all of the documents also lends itself well to a coffee table book approach (even if it's the size of a coffee table) as you can pick it up, flick to any page and learn something new whether you land on information from Peterson himself, or end up inspecting a page highlighting the characteristics of a Reptile in Blackmoor.</p>

<h2><em>The Making Of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Upon first pulling this massive tome out of it's shipping box I was somewhat daunted about all of the information contained within. Once I began reading through it was hard to put it down.</p>
<p>Peterson has done an incredible job not just in providing a timeline and context to the major inspirations and developments that led up to the creation of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> but has nailed the monumental task of immortalizing high-quality copies of so many different documents.</p>
<p>With letters between Gygax and Arneson, hand-marked drafts of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and full printouts of completed versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and its original supplements this book lets any die-hard fan of <em>D&amp;D </em>and TTRPG history keep those pieces for themselves to peruse through at their leisure.</p>
<p>If you're after a history of <em>D&amp;D</em> with a hard narrative throughline you might not get as much out of this resource-dense book, but if you have an interest in viewing the documents as if you were there while history was unfolding then every page of this book will bring you interest.</p>
<p>For the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fanatic, this might be the greatest offering of the 50th anniversary celebration.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons contains within it an incredible recounting of the inception and history of Dungeons &amp; Dragons crediting all of those involved while providing hard documents of what it was like to play at the time. This is a must have for D&amp;D history nerds! (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="MOypv4">Nintendo will broadcast a new Nintendo Direct presentation on Tuesday, June 18, a showcase focused on Switch titles coming in 2024, the company said in a news release on Monday.</p>
<p id="YkTf6D">The Nintendo Direct will run for about 40 minutes and will start at 10 a.m. EDT/7 a.m. PDT. The showcase will stream on Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendo">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a> channels. Nintendo tempered expectations in its news release: “There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.”</p>
<p id="7woMCO">Nintendo only has a couple of Switch games with confirmed release dates at the moment: <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD </em>and <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>. Of course, the company may have a few surprises in store. Nintendo still has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050473/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> on its schedule, and it’s rumored to be sitting on a handful of remakes and remasters of its past games.</p>
<p id="5Hj38E">Confirmed not to appear during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">June’s Nintendo Direct is the company’s next console</a>. In May, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said, “We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.” The company reiterated that message in Monday’s news release — no console news.</p>
<p id="fzew6A">The “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23633001/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2024-backward-compatibility">Switch 2</a>” is reportedly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24075215/nintendo-switch-2-delay-2025-reports">coming sometime in early 2025</a>, and we may not hear official details from Nintendo on that next-gen console until this fall or winter. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, Nintendo finally confirmed concrete details for the anticipated June Direct showcase, now scheduled for June 18, 2024.</p>



<p>The post reiterates that this livestream will focus on games “coming in the second half of 2024.” It will premiere at 7 AM pacific time, and the event will last “roughly 40 minutes.” </p>



<p>Fans can wait for the event thanks to YouTube’s premiere feature. This sometimes features a revealing description. However, this one only includes the same information as the post. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The event description on YouTube also confirms again that “there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.” </p>



<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously confirmed</a> this when announcing that the Direct was coming this month. </p>



<p>However, Furukawa has said that Nintendo plans to reveal the Switch successor sometime <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during this fiscal year</a>. Nintendo also confirmed that the next Switch device will not be a completely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-new-switch-console-isnt-a-brand-new-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new type of console</a>.</p>



<p>There is currently no update on the games coming to the Nintendo Direct this June. Fans are already speculating on the potential lineup. </p>



<p>For example, mobile card game Pokémon TCG Pocket was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announced-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2024</a> last February. However, the next major installment in that franchise is likely reserved for the new Switch device, since Legends Z-A is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/17/the-a-quiet-place-game-breaks-its-silence-with-first-reveal-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/26/a-quiet-place-video-game-announced-for-2022">announced almost three years ago</a>. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>

<p>The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year <em>A Quiet Place Part II</em> hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="408" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although the shutdown of the Nintendo Network this past April meant people couldn’t play 3DS and Wii U games online anymore, a subset of fans challenged themselves to see how long they could stay connected in specific games until they’re forcibly ejected. As of June 16, that total number has dropped from three to two after the final <em>Splatoon</em> on Wii U player revealed they lost their connection.</p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">In April, Twitter user Lcd101 somehow managed to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-dedicated-splatoon-wii-u-player-is-still-online-even-with-matchmaking-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stay online in the first <em>Splatoon</em></a>. They obviously couldn’t play any multiplayer matches since the matchmaking servers were down and there was no one else to play with, but they could still access the in-game shops and view news updates. Their streak had to end eventually, though, and that’s just what happened according to <a href="https://x.com/Lcd101/status/1802122263111581696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Twitter post</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is your Captain speaking. After 68 days online, my connection to Splatoon has been terminated. In my move, I accidentally lost connection to my router.<br>I’d like to thank everyone for this inkredible support. Even though I may be crying now, you’ve kept me going every day. <a href="https://t.co/xlpQogAXIW">pic.twitter.com/xlpQogAXIW</a></p>— Captain Lcd101 (@Lcd101) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lcd101/status/1802122263111581696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="898" data-injectable="true">Lcd101 managed to hang on for 68 days until their connection dropped, which is a ridiculously long time. Some may not see the point behind such a feat, but if anyone decides to chronicle <em>Splatoon 1</em>‘s history in the future, Lcd101’s accomplishment is going to get a mention. “Words cannot express how amazing it’s been to wake up every day and see you cheering me on. You’ve made me the luckiest squid (or octo) online and I’m just so thankful for all of your love. I’ve made so many friends over the last two months, friends that I hope to keep forever,” <a href="https://x.com/Lcd101/status/1802122528103756146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they wrote</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="594" data-injectable="false">Just last month, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-month-later-and-three-people-are-still-connected-to-the-3ds-and-wii-us-defunct-online-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> player</a> also lost their online connection, meaning there are only two people left still connected to the Nintendo Network. According to <a href="https://x.com/GaffsNotLaffs/status/1802127720567947332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Gaffs</a>, those players are Fishguy6564 on <em>Mario Kart 7</em> and SlitherySheep on <em>Super Mario Maker</em>. I, for one, am definitely intrigued to see how much longer these two will stay online. Could they make it to the end of June? Maybe all summer? Whatever the case, a very passionate subset of Nintendo fans is hooked on this saga and there will certainly be a sense of melancholy once it comes to a close.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew a Nintendo Direct was coming this month. It was just a matter of which day it would take place. Now, with all the hype from Summer Game Fest simmering down, Nintendo’s made its move and confirmed an exact date and time for its own summer showcase.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">Said Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow on Tuesday, June 18 at 7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST, and is scheduled to run for 40 minutes. Unsurprisingly, Nintendo hasn’t said exactly what sort of games you can expect from the Direct, but it has reaffirmed that there will be no mention of its next console. It <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already stressed this last month</a>, but sometimes a reminder is necessary.</p> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">This Direct is expected to cover Nintendo’s plans for the second half of 2024, which are otherwise non-existent. Aside from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/luigis-mansion-2-hd-announced-for-summer-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-will-let-you-tackle-challenges-in-classic-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a></em> for the summer, Nintendo has no big titles confirmed for the rest of the year. Even without any details about the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s called), Nintendo could also tease its plans for early 2025.</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">There have also been rumours of third-party related announcements for the next Nintendo Direct. A popular one is that we’ll finally see more of the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> HD-2D remake, and it’s also speculated that the first two games are seeing remakes based on <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this teaser tweet from Square Enix</a>. Earlier today, another rumor spread of <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1802631710708027771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">something <em>Ace Attorney</em> related</a> making an appearance, with some theorizing it will be for a collection of the <em>Ace Attorney Investigations</em> duology.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-exclusive-first-interview-with-%E2%80%9Cstream-big%E2%80%9D-author-nathan-grayson.903336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-stream-big-book-nathan-grayson-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Noted Aftermath co-owner Nathan Grayson, who may or may not have also written this introduction, has written a book. It contains words, pages, a table of contents – the works. It’s called <em>Stream Big: The Triumphs and Turmoils of Twitch and the Stars Behind the Screen</em>, and you can <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder it now</a>. In a show of graceful magnanimity, Grayson has granted Aftermath a world-exclusive first interview about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hello, Nathan! Rumor has it you've written a book! First off: what is a book? Aren't we just here to talk about a longer, more expensive blog?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You ask what a book is, but I want to pose a different question: What <em>isn't </em>a book? What can't a book do? It can travel with you, keep you company in times good and bad, spirit you away to realms previously unimagined. Everyone should buy more books -- and <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mine, specifically</a>.</p><p>In seriousness, though, I thought a lot about this while writing my book – <em>Stream Big: The Triumphs and Turmoils of Twitch and the Stars Behind the Screen</em>, which you can <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder NOW</a> -- as I didn't want it to just be a series of glorified articles. My goal was to tell the story of Twitch as a platform, community, and culture through the lens of the people who use it, to take a series of semi-disparate tales and use them to paint a holistic picture. So while each chapter focuses on a specific streamer, major players weave in and out of each others' stories, which are all pivotal moments in their careers (as opposed to the sort of profile piece you often see online about a specific creator, where the main thrust is basically "Person Exists"). In short: It's a book. Please clap.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Without giving us so many details that we then don't read the book, which we can do after we <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order it TODAY</a>, what is the story of Twitch that you found through writing? What did you learn or come to understand about Twitch through this process?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> First and foremost, the story of Twitch is the story of its community. The service started out deeply intertwined with its user base -- many of the company's first hires came straight out of livestreaming's primordial soup -- and that's always been its main selling point. The reason livestreaming took off in the first place is because even janky, pre-Twitch attempts could create this instant connection between an individual and their viewers. Chat was a game changer (and in many ways remains one; just look at how Twitch continues to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/05/twitch-gaza-protests-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transform coverage of major global and political issues</a>). </p><p>Twitch is by no means perfect, but it’s one of the few places online where people go to have actual conversations. That’s the essential spark that makes the whole machine work. This led to many early innovations in what eventually became the creator economy: the idea of spending money to subscribe to a creator you appreciate, the notion that playing video games on camera can be a real job with a schedule, obligations, and even the risk of burnout.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Twitch’s story is also very much a tale of what’s happened to the internet at large. It couldn’t just stay a cool little place for passionate people to gather.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But Twitch’s story is also very much a tale of what’s happened to the internet at large. It couldn’t just stay a cool little place for passionate people to gather. The community became a commodity, one which Amazon ended up purchasing in 2014. The Amazonification of Twitch was relatively slow, but over time, it transformed the site and its priorities. Twitch needed to make money. It took all sorts of stabs at this, many of which did not gel with its users desires and demands. This led to numerous conflicts between Twitch and the community, which – as you saw while, uh, editing my writing – dominated headlines for a handful of years.</p><p>This is not to say Twitch’s early days were perfect. But there was a palpable sense of belief in the platform itself back then. A community member turned (now-former) Twitch employee coined the slogan “bleed purple” around a decade ago. Twitch users and employees used to say it all the time, almost like they were in a cult. Nobody feels that way anymore. Twitch is a corporate vehicle. It, like so much of the rest of the internet, will never be the thing it started out as again.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That sort of raises the question to me of: is Twitch, for lack of a better word, "over"? The early narrative around Twitch of "you could make a living as a streamer" no longer feels as viable as it once was, if it ever was. And through its various transformations over the years, it feels like it's become an institution, with the problems of any institution, plus a whole bunch of unique problems. Maybe this is a perception just shaped by the drama-heavy coverage things on Twitch often get these days, but does Twitch still... matter? Why should I care about the story of how it got where it is?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it definitely still matters! Despite viewership ebbs and flows -- it definitely peaked in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic -- Twitch’s overall numbers remain astronomical. More than that, though, Twitch culture continues to drive the internet at large. Twitch creators say things that reverberate onto YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc and shape their cultures as well. On top of that, creators are no longer bound by a single platform. Pretty much everyone is everywhere these days, and many consider Twitch to be an essential tool in their tool belts. It’s possible to stream on the aforementioned other platforms, but nowhere is as optimized for it in terms of features and community as Twitch is. I think the days of Twitch aspiring to reach the same heights as YouTube or what have you have long since passed, but it has carved out a potent niche. Unless Amazon screws things up catastrophically in pursuit of profits over all else – something it could still very much do – that will probably remain the case for some time to come.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Should I read this book if I don't know anything about streaming, or the Twitch stars you write about? Or, if I am, say, my 15-year-old nephew and know everything about these Twitch stars, will this book teach me anything new?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So I tried to walk an incredibly fine line and write a book for both of the audiences you just described. When I first pitched it to publishers, I positioned it as a book that’d be perfect for Twitch-obsessed young people and parents who desperately wanted to know what the heck a Twitch was. Some time has passed since then, and I think pop culture at large has a better grip on Twitch’s basic mechanics now, but my book always sought to answer a slightly different question: Why do people like Twitch? Why do people <em>care </em>so much about it?</p><p>In pursuit of that, I chose to focus on the people who use Twitch – streamers and viewers – first and foremost, to tell stories that even uninitiated audiences would find relatable. Technology transforms people to a point, but more than that, I think it gives us new lenses through which to view ourselves. Twitch is a place where universal themes – labor, solidarity, celebrity, gossip, drama, achievement, responsibility (or lack thereof) – play out on a daily basis. People are still people whether they’re doing a normal job like working in a grocery store or streaming on Twitch. They have similar wants, needs, motivations, and even dreams. I tried to write something that conveys that.</p><p>That said, I also went super deep into specific streamers’ lives and histories! If you are a big fan of any of the streamers I chose to focus on, you will probably learn something about them that you didn’t already know. I traveled to their homes and places of work, I interviewed their friends, families, fans, critics, and employees, I dug into public records and police documents. There’s a reason why “Behind The Screen” is part of the title: I’m not just recounting what people already saw. There’d be no point in writing a book if that’s all I aimed to accomplish. Twitch is a place where it’s easy to think you see everything – that you truly know your favorite creators. My book aims to authoritatively dispel that notion.</p><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;I traveled to their homes and places of work, I interviewed their friends, families, fans, critics, and employees, I dug into public records and police documents. There’s a reason why 'Behind The Screen' is part of the title: I’m not just recounting what people already saw. There’d be no point in writing a book if that’s all I aimed to accomplish.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Speaking of all that work, I'm sure every new day brought some new twist that meant you had to revise the book a lot. Was it hard to write a book about this constantly-changing scene, instead of a bunch of articles that can move faster and be updated? How did you decide when to stop?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It was VERY HARD. I had to revise certain chapters a ton. If you follow Twitch closely, you can probably guess which ones! Figuring out when to stop was really tough. After a certain point, I kind of had to draw a line in the sand and say, “That’s it. This is where this chapter ends,” because otherwise I could’ve kept revising some of them forever. In most cases, though, I tried to bring things to a close at natural points where the pivotal moments I chose to focus on were tapering off – where both streamers and audiences had either learned a hard lesson or chosen to move on. As I note in the book’s opening, streamers’ lives are messy and complicated; they’ll have likely lived multiple additional chapters by the time my book comes out. But I hope I can at least provide the most complete possible telling of the moments I chose to focus on.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Was it hard to get the people you write about to agree to talk to you for the book? Did your previous work into this space as a journalist help or hinder that at all?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It helped a lot! To be honest, it was the only reason I was able to write this book at all. Content creation is not a space that has a good relationship with journalism. Some of this is structural: If you’re a content creator, you get to tell your own story on a daily basis. Why bring in a middleman? But also, journalism around the space – shaped by the SEO content mill era of websites – tends to be sensationalistic at best, ridden with errors and falsehoods at worst. (This is not to discount work done by other very, very good journalists in the field. It's just to say that there are far too few, and they do not get the resources they deserve from their respective publications.)</p><p>I’m fortunate in that I was given time and space at both Kotaku and The Washington Post to develop Twitch into a beat that I took seriously, one with demonstrable utility to streamers: I could translate their experience to mainstream audiences. I was able to help legitimize a field that many so-called Adults refused to take seriously. And it’s one that I think <em>deserves </em>to be taken seriously. Streamers shape the thoughts and viewpoints of millions of people. They build spaces that make some feel, for the first time, like they belong. Some streamers are better at this than others, but regardless, it’s hard work – work that is presided over and, to an extent, exploited by Amazon. Not to get all lefty about it, but the best thing we can do for each other as workers is recognize that we’re all part of the same struggle, that we’re all squeezing blood from the same few stones. I hope people come away from my book with a greater understanding of that.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Is there a story or anecdote in the book we might never have heard before? A world premiere, if you will?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I go pretty deep into the early days of what would eventually become streaming – when people were homebrewing ramshackle esports casting setups using broadcasting equipment they bought at Best Buy – in a way that’s pretty interesting. I certainly didn’t know about any of that stuff before I started writing the book.</p><p>There are also some pretty gnarly untold stories about both swattings and burnout in there, about the short and long-term impacts those things have on people. Streamers try to keep a lot of that out of the public eye, but they’re still human beings. They are still impacted just like anybody else would be, sometimes on a daily basis.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Preorder now!</p></blockquote></figure><p>I was also in touch with creators through some of their most difficult moments: Amouranth getting out of an abusive relationship, Dream’s community rebelling after he was accused of grooming minors, Code Miko fighting to keep her company from going under, Keffals getting stalked across the world by Kiwi Farms (and later going into rehab for drug addiction). There’s a lot I ended up seeing that others didn’t. Most of it is… rough. I tried to convey it all as sensitively as possible.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Lastly, we beat the drum a lot about not pre-ordering video games, but it's a pretty different situation in publishing. Why should we <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the book</a>?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m a first-time author, but as I understand it, books live and die by preorders. Preorders teach the Amazon algorithm to prioritize specific books, and even though my book is very critical of Amazon, I, as an author, am to a degree reliant on it. Preorders also signal to the publisher that the book could be a Big Deal, which means they’ll devote more resources to selling and promoting it. Resulting buzz can then lead to larger orders from retailers, which is obviously a good thing. Also, more broadly, preorders are often counted as sales, meaning that if you get a bunch of preorders ahead of release, your book then looks like it’s selling incredibly well – and potentially charting – during its first week. Ideally, that leads to continued sales, hopefully forever. Basically, the whole thing is a chain reaction that starts now.</p><p>If we’re drawing a specific comparison to video games, what you see before a game comes out is not always what you get. Games change dramatically during development, and publishers don’t do a great job of cluing prospective buyers into that process. My book is done! Unless something absolutely bonkers happens to one of the streamers featured in it, there will be no need for additional revisions prior to release. It is what it is! It’s good, I promise! <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preorder now</a>!

		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind Games have revealed A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a quiet and sneaky horror game that’s set to release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can get a feel of from the trailer, every moment in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be about trying to survive and navigate the world while staying as quiet as possible. You’ll also note the need to use an asthma pump and a handheld noise meter. Of course, this is animated as opposed to gameplay, but it’s indicative of the elements you’ll need to juggle. The game will follow an original story, casting players as a young women struggling to evade the nightmare monsters, as well as overcoming family conflicts and inner fears in this spin-off from the popular film franchise.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this reveal has come at the exact right time, just a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of A Quiet Place: Day One.</p>


<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. From the trailer, this would be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game – here’s hoping for some Alien: Isolation vibes.</p>
<p>What’s not immediately is how this relates to the A Quiet Place game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/a-quiet-place-video-game-2022-trailer/">first confirmed to be in development back in 2021</a>. That game was also to be published by Saber, but had developers iLLOGIKA and EP1T0ME attached. Certainly Saber has held onto the video game license while being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/embracer-has-officially-sold-off-saber-interactive/">sold off by Embracer</a>, but this game is from a different developer. We’ve asked for clarity on this point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quiet-place-road-ahead-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind have announced&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em>, a game based on the popular movie franchise. It's launching later this year.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine if you've seen the movies,&nbsp;<em>The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>will task you with sneaking through a variety of environments while trying not to make any noise.</p>
<p>The story told here will be entirely new, so you won't be retreading the events of either of the already-released movie installments, nor will you be playing an adaptation of the upcoming prequel&nbsp;<em>Day One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=qsI48I5i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=PluGyxh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ever wondered how you'd do against the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place</em>? Well, wonder no more.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place&nbsp;</em>aren't exactly known for being pushovers, it doesn't sound like you'll be able to engage in any form of combat in Stormind's game.</p>
<p>Rather, you'll be sneaking around each environment, scavenging for tools and distracting the monsters to help you pass by unnoticed. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Outlast</em>, then you'll know what kind of ballpark you're in here.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of journey you're in for. Suffice it to say that if you're looking for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style action horror shenanigans, you ain't gonna find them here.</p>

<p>Developer Stormind Games has a history with horror. Although the studio's most recent game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Batora: Lost Haven</em>, it's also known for psychological horror jaunts&nbsp;<em>Remothered: Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>and its followup&nbsp;<i>Broken Porcelain</i>.</p>
<p><em>Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/5495/remothered-tormented-fathers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broadly positive reviews</a> on its release back in 2018, but&nbsp;<em>Broken Porcelain</em>'s reception was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/10349/remothered-broken-porcelain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly more frosty</a> a couple of years later. Our own reviewer rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-tormented-fathers-review-twisted-experience">enjoyed</a> both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-broken-porcelain-review">games</a>, though.</p>
<p>At any rate,&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced the date and time for its next Direct showcase.</p>
<p>Those wanting to hear more about what the Mario maker has in store over the coming months can tune in on 18th June, at 3pm. The Direct will be available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kX3BkD5PVUM">Nintendo's YouTube channels</a>.</p>

<p> Back in May, Nintendo officially discussed what the world has dubbed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> for the first time, stating it would make an announcement within this fiscal year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">not during its June presentation</a>.</p> <div>

        <p>And why early access was so important.</p>

Baldur's Gate 3 will receive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">official mod support in a forthcoming patch</a>, which Larian CEO Swen Vincke said will be a handover moment to players.

</p>
<p>
Speaking at BAFTA's An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 after the game received multiple wins at this year's awards, Vincke discussed development of the game and Larian's long term support.
</p>
<p>
"One of the big things for us, and the one that we're really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur's Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things," said Vincke. "And I think that will be the point where we're going to say 'ok, now it's yours fully'."

</figure>
<p>
He admitted the team hasn't finished development of mod support yet and that it's been "hard trying to make that work". The release of the update, though, won't mark the end of support entirely, but "you will see the level of support diminished to really critical bug fixes" and for now "we're still working as if the game was just out".
</p>
<p>
When asked if he was looking forward to this "final handover moment", Vincke replied with an emphatic "yes". 
</p>
<p>
"We're working on our new thing, we're super excited about the new games," he continued. "We're creative spirits also, we don't want to keep on doing the same thing, we really want to move forward and do new things."
</p>
<p>
We know already it's likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-next-game-likely-early-access-launch-too">Larian's next game will also be released in early access</a>, as director of publishing Michael Douse previously stated.

</p>
<p>
Vincke spoke further at BAFTA about the importance of early access for Baldur's Gate 3's development.
</p>
<p>
"The biggest thing that came out was it allowed us to course correct," said Vincke. "There were mistakes that we were making and the players were telling us 'this is a mistake, you shouldn't be doing this'.
</p>
<p>
"We try to listen and do as much as we can, where we think it makes a lot of sense. So that I think was instrumental in BG3's success."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SA902342.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>BAFTA/Dan Fearon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But how do developers know what feedback is actually useful? "A lot of it is on gut feeling," said Vincke, admitting some elements can be analysed through data. "At the end of the day it's really how do I feel like a player about the game. I think if you do it any other way, you will just be paralysed, you won't be able to do anything. If you're going to try to do it by committee, then it's just going to be the most mediocre things that you can have. You have to follow your gut and say 'what game do you want to play?' And then it actually comes very easy, you just have to hope that that's the game that other people want to play also."
</p>
<p>
He added: "You also have to take into account there are many, many people in the universe with many many opinions. So it's impossible to cater to everyone. You don't necessarily always have to listen to the majority if you really believe in what's inside of the game."
</p>
<p>
So is early access the future of game development? At the least, Vincke said he would "heartily recommend it", but admitted four years of early access was "actually quite long" as players can get tired over that time. 
</p>
<p>
He continued: "You really shouldn't approach it with the attitude 'oh it's just early access'. There are players playing this that care. So you should treat them with respect."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">Baldur's Gate 3 won five awards at this year's BAFTAs</a>, including Best Game. A recording of An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 will soon be up on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@bafta">BAFTA YouTube channel</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">Larian recently opened a new studio in Poland</a> as development on its next project ramps up.

            <p>Fallout has seen a renewed spike in popularity following the release of Amazon's TV adaptation. However, despite this, Bethesda doesn't feel under pressure to rush a new game out to placate fans.</p>
<p>Speaking with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard acknowledged that the Fallout series is probably at its most popular, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">franchise boasting some record player numbers over recent months</a>. Howard went on to state the studio gives "a lot of thought to franchise management" when questioned specifically about the future of Fallout as a whole.</p>
<p>"I spend a lot of time thinking about franchises I love... so, for us, it is sort of game planning out - number one, making sure Fallout is relevant in the world, and well, I think, clearly it is," the studio exec said. </p>

</figure>
<p>"People are hungry for even more. We've never stopped doing Fallout work. A lot of that work goes on, obviously, in Fallout 76." At this point, he mentioned its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-skyline-valley-update-strikes-right-at-the-heart-of-what-you-love-about-single-player-fallout">new Skyline Valley update</a>, saying the team is "really excited with where that game is at".</p>
<p>But, what about other Fallout games in the future? "Obviously, I can't talk about those right now," Howard said. "But, I would say rushing through them or 'we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we're doing in 76', you know, we don't feel like we need to rush any of that."</p>
<p>Howard believes Amazon's Fallout TV show fills a gap for the series' fanbase "in terms of the franchise and storytelling". He said he still understands the community's "desire for a new mainline single-player game", but noted "those things take time".</p>
<p>Said Howard: "I don't think it's bad for people to miss things, as well... we just want to get it right and make sure that everything we're doing in a franchise - whether it's Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield - that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>The developer said his preference is often to hold things back for as long as possible, saying his "perfect scenario for games" is to "announce them and get them out as quickly as possible" - a point he has made before.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the studio's Elder Scrolls 6 reveal in 2018. However, according to Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">Elder Scrolls 6 was only announced when it was because "the pitchforks and torches were out"</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wishes he had announced The Elder Scrolls 6 differently</a>.</p>
<p>"I probably would've announced it more casually" today, Howard said in August, admitting he had "asked [himself] a lot" if he regrets revealing the game when he did.</p>
<p>That being said, The Elder Scrolls 6 still looks to be Bethesda's next big RPG release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Fallout 5 is also confirmed</a>, but won't arrive until afterwards.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in his conversation with MrMattyPlays, Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Starfield will be getting at least one more expansion after Shattered Space</a> releases later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> has had a long journey to get to where it is today. It’s a project that’s been in limbo for over a decade since it was originally announced in 2010. It’s been canceled multiple times, and the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine didn’t help.</p>
<p>But we’re closer to it coming out since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-still-rough-but-promising">last time we saw it at Gamescom</a>, and I was lucky enough to try a demo of the game at Summer Game Fest Play Days, and it was a surreal experience that immersed me into its world.</p>
<p>The demo introduced me to the protagonist, a man on the mission who acts as if he has nothing left to lose. Despite any warnings, he needs to dive deeper into the Zone to learn more about some artifact, and that’s where our story begins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Stalker 2 </em>is an immersive first-person shooter, and it leans into supernatural horror elements. I started off with a pistol and knife, and I had to scavenge for any other equipment and ammo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game started me in the Zone, a place suffering from the aftermath of a second alternate-history Chornobyl disaster. The local wildlife has been irradiated and irreversibly mutated, and I ran into a few of these creatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, the real monster in any of these sorts of stories is our fellow man. Some military group is also looking for the same artifact my character is learning about, leading to some gunfights in dark places.</p>

<p>Overall, the gunplay here feels a little bit floaty and weightless, which is at odds with the rest of the movement. Running and turning felt a little heavy and intentional, inherently slowing down the general pace of the game. But when the guns feel a bit like peashooters, the experience doesn’t quite mesh well.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2</em> seems like the sort of game that will really encourage exploring and looting anything that isn’t nailed to the ground. Ammo was scarce, and I found lots of new weapons to switch to just by searching enemy bodies or rundown homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of story and dialog though, I was mostly hooked into the mystery of the world and the protagonist. I haven’t seen much of the other <em>Stalker </em>games, so I’m likely missing some context. But considering the franchise has been quiet for a couple years, I’m likely not the only person who could experience it for the first time through <em>Stalker 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s something eerie in the air in the Zone. The protagonist wants to keep digging deeper into it to figure out the secret behind some weird artifact he found, despite someone else telling him to leave before things get worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But is it the Zone itself that’s somehow getting worse? Are the other soldiers going to be the problem? It always feels like something is lurking in the shadows, making the atmosphere tense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it’s hard to say how <em>Stalker 2</em> will shake out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-date-revealed-and-pre-orders-available-now">when it releases on Sept. 5</a>, I think there’s enough here to keep me interested in seeing more. It has an interesting narrative hook with a compelling setting, and there’s a dystopic open world to explore.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-is-coming-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a new filing spotted <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bankier</a>, CI Games is working on a sequel for Lords of the Fallen, due for release in 2026.</p>



<p>All of the information from the filing has been translated from a Polish version. So, it does warn that it “may contain certain discrepancies.”</p>



<p>Via translation, the new filing does not confirm a concrete release date. However, it does mention that CI Games signed a contract with Epic Games for the exclusive rights to release it on PC. </p>



<p>These rights appear to extend “for the entire product life cycle,” implying the sequel will not come to Steam. The first Lords of the Fallen was available on Windows.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Lords of the Fallen sequel, currently going by Project 3, will also be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S platforms. </p>



<p>Versions of the game for PlayStation and Xbox are “currently in development.” So, these ports might be available at launch, like its predecessor.</p>



<p>The previous Lords of the Fallen game launched in 2023 to mixed fan reviews on both Steam and Metacritic. Publisher CI Games faced layoffs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-publisher-ci-games-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in January 2024</a>, as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-developer-ci-games-lays-off-30-more-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> in May 2024.</p>



<p>However, the developers did muster <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final update</a> on Lords of the Fallen 2023 last April, titled Master of Fate. This major update introduced new questlines, skills, improved balancing, and more.</p>

"While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close."</p><p>This likely comes as welcome news to fans of the soulslike genre created by Miyazaki and FromSoftware, who seemingly have games even better than Elden Ring to look forward to in the future.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close. It's getting close.</p></div><p>Miyazaki didn't share what elements were missing from Elden Ring, because "it's hard to say without giving spoilers for [his] next idea or [FromSoftware's] next games," but did say the slightly tragic reality that he never gets to experience the wonder of his own games is one thing holding him back.</p><p>"I think one thing that's not necessarily missing, but makes it difficult to achieve my ideal, is that when I play it, I know everything's going to happen," Miyazaki said. "I already know everything that's going on. So in terms of enjoying the game from a player's perspective, I'd love to not know that, and for somebody else to make my ideal fantasy game, please, if possible. Then I can enjoy it just as a player."</p><p>Players will get to experience that feeling once again when Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion launches on June 21, 2024.</p><p>Just like previous FromSoftware games Dark Souls and Bloodborne, however, accessing the DLC isn't as simple as selecting it on a menu, as players must tick off a handful of obscure feats beforehand, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-publisher-warns-fans-they-have-less-than-two-weeks-to-beat-mohg-so-they-can-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc">including beating an optional boss</a>.

Many fans are therefore waiting with bated breath for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-and-new-trailer">release of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, which will likely add hundreds, if not thousands, of new secrets and story threads to be discovered.

CD Projekt Red declined to comment on the alleged leaks when contacted by IGN.</p><p>The moon is an established hub in Cyberpunk 2077 lore and can be visited fairly simply for those with enough money. It features as a significant plot point in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review">Cyberpunk Edgerunners</a> animated series but is only touched on briefly in the game, though off-planet locations are teased in a handful of missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The leaks allegedly come from the stream of stolen data <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-stolen-data-leak-videos-bug-montage-third-person">hackers obtained from CD Projekt Red in 2021</a>. Other content including a scrapped third-person build appeared at the time but these references to moon missions, if real, are the first to emerge in a long time.</p><p>It's no secret CD Projekt Red scrapped a wealth of post-launch content for Cyberpunk 2077 after it launched in 2020 with myriad issues, however, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-multiplayer-mode-was-cancelled-following-its-turbulent-launch">a multiplayer mode that will never see the light of day</a> (but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-considering-adding-multiplayer-to-cyberpunk-2">maybe in Cyberpunk 2077's sequel</a>).</p><p>CD Projekt Red thus switched its focus to fixing Cyberpunk 2077 though eventually released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> as its one and only expansion. This arrived after the game-changing Update 2.0, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/All_Cyberpunk_2077_2.0_Updates_and_Changes">completely revamped Cyberpunk 2077 with features such as a new perk system and improved AI</a>, and was followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-21-patch-notes-include-metro-system-romantic-hangouts-and-new-vehicles">another big update in 2.1</a> but only minor changes afterwards.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Nintendo has finally announced its next Nintendo Direct showcase, and it's very soon--like, <em>tomorrow</em> soon, June 18. As the first Nintendo Direct in many months and the one scheduled during peak Not-E3 season, it should be big. Here's how to watch the Nintendo Direct on June 18 and what to expect.</p><h2>How to watch the Nintendo Direct</h2><p>The Nintendo Direct presentation will be available on Nintendo's official YouTube and Twitch channels, and we'll have it embedded right here on this page so you can watch it all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kX3BkD5PVUM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Nintendo Direct start time</h2><p>The Nintendo Direct is scheduled to begin at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Tuesday, June 18.</p><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Nintendo has said the broadcast will be 40 minutes long and focused on Nintendo Switch games set for release in the second half of 2024. There will be no <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> news during the event. More specifically, Nintendo said "there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" at the show.</p><p>In terms of which games might appear during the Nintendo Direct, the company did not mention any by name, but we could get a quick update on Luigi's Mansion 2 HD (even though it's out next week and not technically a game releasing in the second half of 2024). Another possibility for what could appear is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4</a>, which was announced a long time ago. Who knows, maybe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> will show up, too, even though it's not scheduled to release until 2025.</p><p>Given the show runs for 40 minutes, it's expected that this Nintendo Direct will be a meaty one filled with games, so fans are understandably excited for it. Just don't expect any news on the next Nintendo console, as the company is no doubt saving a bigger reveal for sometime later on.</p>

		<p>Pieces Interactive, the studio behind this year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a> remake, has been closed by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>The news comes from a statement posted to the Pieces Interactive website, saying “Thanks for playing with us” and that “Our last release was the reimagining of Alone in the Dark.”</p>


<p>Unfortunately for Pieces Interactive, while it had grand ambitions to emulate the Resident Evil remake revival and brought in some popular actors to lend their performance and likenesses, Alone in the Dark failed to meet expectations, both in terms of critical reception and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/24/alone-in-the-dark-and-outcast-reboots-both-underperform-for-embracer/">“softer than expected” sales</a> after the game’s eventual March 2024 release. The studio has already been hit with layoffs a month later, but is now being completely closed by Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Pieces produced a number of original games, such as Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice and Leviathan Warships, and work-for-hire games that included <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/06/03/magicka-2-review/">Magicka 2</a>. The studio was acquired by Embracer in 2017 and initially worked on expansions for Titan Quest – Ragnarök and Atlantis – before getting the opportunity to reimagine survival horror classic Alone in the Dark.</p>

<p>They join the long list of studios closed by Embracer Group over the last year – 44 studios have closed including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/11/free-radical-design-shutdown-timesplitters-cancelled/">Free Radical Design</a>, Onoma and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-shut-down/">Volition</a> – amid layoffs that have affected over 4,500 employees. Embracer has also sold off studios and sub-groups, such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/embracer-has-officially-sold-off-saber-interactive/">Saber Interactive</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/embracer-sells-off-gearbox-to-take-two-for-460-million/">Gearbox</a>, and announced a plan to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/22/embracer-group-plans-to-split-into-three-separate-companies/"> split into three separate entities</a>.</p>

(Given FromSoft has acknowledged there are leaks, it would suggest there’s some validity to the claims.) After a certain amount of goading, the anon account uploaded a better quality, much longer video of what they purport to be the final boss fight. Although adds, “My friend sux so I have no idea. He told me this was the final boss, but it wouldn’t surprise me if he missed something.”</p><p>Elsewhere the same account has posted three-minute videos of significant fights with named characters in the subject lines, thus removing surprises even for those who don’t click past the spoiler warnings on the clips. (I don’t know a thing about <em>Elden Ring</em>, and so don’t mind at all that I’ve seen this stuff, if you were worrying. It might as well be in Klingon.)</p><p>So, be warned. A lot more of this will start to appear as Friday approaches, so if you’re looking to truly protect yourself, just set up a VPN that blocks all web traffic but for <em>Kotaku</em>. We promise we won’t ruin a thing.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Saber Interactive has just released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91zi75E_SA8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer</a> for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, which included a release window for 2024.</p>



<p>The new game, based on the popular A Quiet Place horror film series, will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>The trailer features first-person exploration gameplay, ending with a jump scare. It also states that the footage was captured in-engine.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer description says that “the road ahead is paved with sound decisions.” This play on words could simply refer to survival mechanics, or possibly that player decisions can impact the story. </p>



<p>Developer Stormind Games, mentioned at the beginning of the trailer, did work on the choice-driven adventure Batora: Lost Haven.</p>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead also has an <a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a> with further details. It confirms players will “strive for silence when hiding from, and sneaking by, horrific creatures who hunt using only sound.”</p>



<p>It also reveals that this will be a new story set in the universe established by A Quiet Place, rather than a direct adaptation. The plot will center on “a young survivor trying to navigate the new, eerily tranquil, post-apocalyptic landscape.”</p>



<p>It may also have open world elements, since players can “discover your own path through the world by observing your environment and leveraging the tools in your surroundings.”</p>

                <p>So far, 2024 has been a brutal year for the video game industry, and it's not showing any signs of letting up. Now, Galvanic Games, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizard-with-a-gun-launches-a-day-early-to-avoid-clash-with-diablo-4s-steam-debut/1100-6518427/" data-ref-id="1100-6518427">Wizard with a Gun</a>, is the latest studio to shut down.</p><p>Galvanic Games founder and president Patrick Morgan shared the news on social media. And he noted that despite the fact that Wizard with a Gun was well-received, the game's sales weren't high enough to save the studio.</p><p>"It is with a heavy heart that I announce the closure of Galvanic Games," wrote Morgan. "Despite the promising start of Wizard with a Gun, sales are not strong enough to sustain our studio. The last year has been particularly tough for games.

                <p>Ten years ago this month, the retro side-scrolling action game Shovel Knight made its debut. To celebrate the anniversary, Yacht Club Games live-streamed an event that featured two big announcements. The first was a new definitive version of the game, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. And the second piece of news was confirmation that a Shovel Knight sequel is also in development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbpEXPSvFtc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Shovel of Hope DX is coming to Steam, and it features a number of enhancements that weren't present in the original Shovel Knight. To start, gamers can choose between 20 playable characters, from Shovel Knight and Shield Knight to their adversary, the Enchantress. Those aren't simply cosmetic changes, as each character has their own abilities and play styles. The game is also adding a rewind function, as well as 300 cheats that can be applied for a unique gameplay experience.</p><p>Additionally, Shovel of Hope DX will include Challenge Stages, Custom Knight, and the Battle Ghost Arena, as well full Stereoscopic 3D. Online and local multiplayer options are also supported.</p><p>As for the sequel, Sean Velasco, a designer for Yacht Club Games, said that it will feature "groundbreaking innovative gameplay mechanics," before adding that it will bring Shovel Knight "into an entirely new dimension of gaming." Velasco also hinted that clues have been left in previous Yacht Club Games titles that will shed some light on the Shovel Knight sequel.</p><p>Neither the Shovel Knight sequel nor Shovel of Hope DX have release dates yet. However, Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX can be added to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2661310/Shovel_Knight_Shovel_of_Hope_DX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">your wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>Back in 2021, Saber Interactive announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-quiet-place-is-becoming-a-single-player-story-driven-horror-adventure-game/1100-6497384/" data-ref-id="1100-6497384">making a video game based on the film series A Quiet Place</a>, and now the game has been officially unveiled. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a new atmospheric horror game from Stormind Games and Saber, and it's set for release in 2024.</p><p>The eerie announcement trailer shows that the game follows the formula of the film series, which is that players must remain quiet to prevent the aliens from detecting them. The Road Ahead is set for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Road Ahead doesn't re-tell the story of A Quiet Place or A Quiet Place 2 (or the upcoming prequel Day One) but instead tells an original story inspired by the movie series. Players take on the role of a young survivor attempting to make their way through a very scary post-apocalyptic world.</p><p>Stormind Games previously made Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered series. Back in the 2021 announcement, Saber said it was partnering with the developers iLLOGIKA and EP1T0ME on a game based on A Quiet Place. So it's not immediately clear if this is that game or something else.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320010" data-ratio="0.55685618729097" data-width="1196" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320010"></a><figcaption>A scene from The Road Ahead</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320010-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.04am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4320013,1300-4320014,1300-4320015,1300-4320016" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320013-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.10am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320014-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.16am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320015-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.25am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4320016-screenshot2024-06-17at9.10.31am.png"></figure><p>As for the film series, the prequel, Day One, releases in theaters later this month.

The story and conceit was created by writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, and the film project gathered steam when John Krasinski--who was better known for his comedic work on The Office--came aboard to co-write and direct.</p>
