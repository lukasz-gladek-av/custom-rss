                <p dir="ltr">Vlambeer has provided a major update to Nuclear Throne for the first time since November 2017, adding support for 60/120fps modes, a new controls menu, and various aspect ratios. So far, these features are part of the beta build for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike</a> shooter. The company plans to bring them to everyone in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Nuclear Throne beta build was announced <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/nuclearthrone/announcements/detail/528724684296945992">on Steam</a>, with directions on how to get into the game's beta. However, all players of the top-down shooter should see the updates eventually, with Vlambeer promising to "bring these improvements and more to the main game." Intriguingly, <a href="https://x.com/Vlambeer/status/1937966326447833330" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>, the company noted that there are physical versions of Nuclear Throne available for Switch as part of the post thread. This could maybe hint at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 update</a> for the game that allows for 120fps on the hybrid system.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Nuclear Throne can be found on PC, PS4, PS Vita, Xbox One, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-nintendo-switch-games-are-out-now-after-dire/1100-6465717/">Switch (it arrived in 2019)</a>. The game started in Steam Early Access in 2013 before fully launching in late 2015. The new beta build improvements may also tease possible versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though Vlambeer hasn't stated anything official.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the reasons for the long break in updates for Nuclear Throne is probably partially because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/acclaimed-dev-vlambeer-is-surprise-shutting-down-o/1100-6481685/">the studio effectively closed down in 2020 after 10 years</a>. However, almost a year ago, Vlambeer returned after co-founder Jan Willem Nijman bought the name outright, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24121948/nuclear-throne-vlambeer-studio-ownership" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>. With the company's second act, Nijman noted he aimed to "preserve the classic Vlambeer games, and make sure they stay playable far into the future." Vlambeer is also known for Ridiculous Fishing, with Ultrabugs in the works.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is more likely to be held back by software limitations, some of them shared with its predecessor, than hardware limitations.</p>
<p>Speaking in the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassells commented on some of the Nintendo Switch 2 software limitations that could impact game performance. Among them are the FAT32 and exFAT file systems, which both the original Switch and the new generation system use. These dated file systems have all sorts of drawbacks over other file systems, such as the 4GB file size limit of FAT32, which leads to issues such as forcing developers to use smaller files, which can limit texture quality, or dividing files into chunks. Regarding this, the Alderon Games founder finds it baffling that Nintendo continues to use these dated file systems, as they also pay a licensing fee to Microsoft to use them with no concrete benefit. PlayStation consoles, for example, use their file systems based on Linux free file systems, and so have none of the limitations of FAT32 and exFAT.</p>
<p>This isn't the only software limitation the Nintendo Switch 2 has that the other consoles don't. While developers can work around the file size limit, Nintendo puts another limitation on top of it. Unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo keeps a strict limit on how many times a game can write data on the NAND to prevent it from dying too soon, which is thoroughly checked in the rigorous approval process for both new games and updates. According to the Alderon Games founder, this is a limitation forced by the company's choice of cheap NAND, which poses the question of whether these limitations are worth the little Nintendo saves on these chips. Additionally, these limitations become even worse if other factors are considered, such as the system reserving a lot of resources for the OS and GameChat, and the massive usage of encryption and DRM, which is not surprising, considering Nintendo's stance on hacking and piracy.</p>
<p>Though this will likely become less of an issue down the line, the Alderon Games founder also lamented the lack of Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which only a few developers own. As such, many developers who want to continue supporting their games on the new system have to do a lot of guesswork and hope the build they are submitting works flawlessly on it.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Flaw Could Affect Millions, AMD Zen 6 Nears 7GHz, Switch 2 | Alderon Games | Broken Silicon 315" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjR1uk9LI9c?start=3335&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While some of these limitations could impact games more down the line, they are not exactly a problem right now for users, as the Nintendo Switch 2 is proving to be extremely successful, and has shown what it can do in the hands of expert developers such as CD Projekt Red with the Cyberpunk 2077 port.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-republic-games-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-writer-chris-avellone-teams-up-with-ex-quantic-dream-dev-for-mature-rpg.1229082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Avellone, a legendary industry writer who's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, has joined <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>&nbsp;writer Adam Williams' Republic Games for a "mature" fantasy RPG.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-joins-former-quantic-dreams-writer-at-republic-games-to-work-on-ambitious-project-inspired-by-golden-age-of-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Avellone has been added to Williams' team, and while his position in the company is unclear, it's likely that he'll be working as a writer on the project.</p>

<p>Avellone himself says he's the one who asked Williams to join Republic Games; he says that he loves both the "design principles" and the "narrative construction" Williams is building for the project, and that being on the "ground floor" of the game is "amazing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=-8Huog4T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=BsGBYDi9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chris Avellone's industry credits include&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Williams says that Republic Games' first title will be an RPG with a "rich, interesting story", and that it'll feature "lots of meaningful choices, branches, and endings".</p>

<p>The game will revolve around "a totalitarian regime seeking to crush a rebellion", and there will be "competing factions" the player can join. You'll have the "freedom to create the hero - or antihero - [you] want to be", according to Williams.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the game will feature a "deep undercurrent of prophecy and the supernatural", and that it'll also revolve around "full, classic RPG gameplay" that will incorporate "combat, character creation, recruitable companions, romances, and more".</p>

<p>The goal with the as-yet-unnamed game, Williams says, is to "combine that 'golden-age-of-RPGs' design with next-level interactive storytelling". It all sounds pretty ambitious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=2bE6Ph32 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=FKk5jwtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adam Williams has worked as a writer on Quantic Dream's&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Avellone's journey in recent years has been a rocky one. In 2020, multiple women <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-removed-from-games-over-assault-allegations" rel="nofollow">accused him of sexual assault</a>, and although he was later cleared of the allegations, his name hasn't popped up on many major releases since those claims were leveled at him.</p>

<p>For now, Republic Games' ambitious-sounding RPG remains unannounced. Hopefully, we'll get a full reveal in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

He’ll commend you for being humble, then explain how to begin the journey, offering you a map of the Wayshrines.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d555b14c36f054a3b2d53adcb1ef804" data-recommend-id="image://7d555b14c36f054a3b2d53adcb1ef804" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The handdrawn map showing the wayshrines of the Knights of the Nine in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The handdrawn map showing the wayshrines of the Knights of the Nine in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d555b14c36f054a3b2d53adcb1ef804" data-recommend-id="image://7d555b14c36f054a3b2d53adcb1ef804" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The handdrawn map showing the wayshrines of the Knights of the Nine in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The easiest way to do this is to pull up the map on a separate screen, perhaps your phone, and then do your very best to mark the general location on your in-game map.

<p>2022's excellent indie RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chained_echoes">Chained Echoes</a>' DLC, 'Ashes of Elrant', is coming to Switch on <strong>7th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>After being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/indie-rpg-hit-chained-echoes-announces-ashes-of-elrant-dlc">announced earlier this year</a>, publisher Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger today shared a brand new trailer for the story-based DLC today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006">on Steam</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-launches-august-7">Gematsu</a>). Ashes of Elrant was originally planned for Q2 of this year, and August is a <em>little</em> out of that window, but the studio (founded by Matthias Linda) admits that while the DLC was ready, the various translations weren't, so they decided to hold back.</p>
<p>The upcoming DLC sounds absolutely huge and includes a brand new land to explore, over 40 new enemies, a new playable character, more than 15 new music tracks from composer Eddie Marianukroh, new minigames, and new equipment.</p>
<p>Other than the trailer and those little bullet points listed above, here's what else we know about the DLC from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3350260/Chained_Echoes_Ashes_of_Elrant/">its Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ashes of Elrant</strong> takes place right before the end of <strong>Chained Echoes</strong>. While you and your clan are preparing for the final fight, a new call for help reaches the Crimson Wings. This mission will reveal more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past. What challenges await you in a new land where nothing is as it seems?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this sounds like a must-play if you loved the base game, which we did. We'll be suiting up in our mechs all over again this August, then.</p>

That’s the question on everyone’s mind following the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release of Ver. 1.1.2 on June 25</a></span>. The update is very small, with only a few patch notes. The most controversial one reads: “Adjusted courses selected in ‘Random’ when selecting next course in a wireless ‘VS Race.’” That’s apparently Nintendo-speak for “you’re playing the game wrong.” </p><p>See, <em>Mario Kart World</em> is divided into two types of stages. There are the familiar ones like Mario Bros. Circuit and Bowser’s Castle, and then there are the interstitial courses that connect each of these stages in the open world. Each Grand Prix consists of a mix of both, with races on the tracks themselves and also the routes racing between them. They make sense for the game’s new knockout mode, but can otherwise upend the flow of a race. </p><p>Players were getting tired of needing to do that in online vs. mode, too.<em> Mario Kart</em> fans are a competitive bunch and wanted consistency, plus some of the connective tracks are kind of boring. People quickly discovered that if everyone in a lobby selects “random” for the track, <em>Mario Kart World</em> would automatically default to a regular three-lap version of a track. Everyone started doing it. There were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1le7vdy/the_current_state_of_mkw_online/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1le7vdy/the_current_state_of_mkw_online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memes about it</a></span>. <em>Mario Kart</em> fans essentially created their own version of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> fans’ “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ssbwiki.com/No_items,_Fox_only,_Final_Destination&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/No_items,_Fox_only,_Final_Destination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Items, Fox Only, Final Destination.</a></span>” </p><p>Apparently Nintendo did not like that, taking roughly a week from when the workaround hit peak meme status in the community to pull the emergency break. “They addressed this in the most Nintendo way possible,” wrote one player on Reddit. “You WILL play as we intend and you will like it!” “Please understand,” another <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqqkh/the_entire_community_rn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1lkqqkh/the_entire_community_rn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>, “Like.

If <em>Mario Kart World</em> were on Steam it would be getting review bombed right now.

These magical artefacts aren’t just for show either, as they will provide positive blessings for guests when well maintained… but watch out, those who don’t look after these intriguing curios will find they curse guests instead!</p><p>To discover these new magical exhibits on your expeditions, you’ll need to hire Fantasy Experts from Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue or Bard classes, each of whom possess their own stats. Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack? Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut. Whatever the obstacle, “Fantasy Finds” will challenge you to hire a varied party of fantasy experts with their own strengths and talents to ensure you successfully return home from expeditions with new magical exhibits.</p><p>That’s not all, as “Fantasy Finds” will also weave its fantasy magic throughout your museum with three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors and you’ll even see your expedition helicopter joining in the fun, thanks to a fresh paint job ensuring it fits the medieval fantasy mood. You can even buff your museum staff with Mythical Gear exhibits which can be equipped or put on display, providing bonuses such as protection on nearby exhibits or even job security to fend off being fired.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

We spoke to Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman to find out.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A viral hit made in South Korea">A viral hit made in South Korea</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman tells us that Peak took shape during a game jam between Aggro Crab and Landfall. It's a tidbit both teams had already shared, but what we didn't know is that the entire production essentially took place during a month-long retreat in Seoul. Three members of the Aggro Crab team flew out to the South Korean capital to meet with four Landfall staffers, mimicking the process Landfall undertook when developing its previous release </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/frontier-yanks-generative-ai-portraits-from-jurassic-world-evolution-3-after-fans-revolt" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frontier pulls generative AI portraits from Jurassic World Evolution 3 after fan backlash</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every waking moment was either working on the game or talking about the game over KBBQ and soju. We locked in. We did have to learn each other’s work styles. Like how [Landfall lead designer] Wilhelm types only the letter 'f' for every git commit message because 'it's the fastest key to press on the keyboard.' Things like that," says Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Collaboration was very natural, which was something I had to get used to as someone who's used to more rigorous production. People would just add whatever felt important or funny on a given day to the game, but with everyone's level of experience, there was a lot of trust in each other that those decisions made sense."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4bUA3UHajXE?si=Hirt6_Nf4hhA6lVX" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vast majority of production took place during that four-week period starting in February 2025, which meant both teams were able to add polish "at a slower pace" when they touched back down on home soil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaman explains there wasn't the need for a hard budget because it was obvious </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wouldn't cost much compared to a traditional indie project. That said, he estimates Aggro Crab and Landfall spent less than $200,000 overall—which he notes is "pretty doable" for two studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/riot-shutters-hypixel-studios-and-cancels-hytale-after-a-decade-in-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">Riot shutters Hypixel Studios and cancels Hytale after a decade in development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was mainly just a couple months salaries and the Airbnb, flights, and food for Korea," he adds. The biggest challenge, says Kaman, wasn't financing or actually building the title, but rather agreeing on a direction for their initial concept. The team had taken to chatting over Discord before flying out to Korea, and that led to some combative discussions they've since come to blame on the fallibility of the written word.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we wanted to make a game about lost scouts but there were so many directions the mechanics were being pulled in. We got into a few arguments in Discord, worried that if we didn’t get it right, we would end up stuck in Korea making a bad game we didn’t really believe in," he continues. "To our surprise, things clicked shortly after meeting up in person, where we figured out this is a game about free-form climbing and managing afflictions on your stamina bar. This led to a phrase we would say often: 'text is evil.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us&quot;">"This level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scope creep is another evil familiar to most developers, but Kaman explains Aggro Crab and Landfall swerved the issue by agreeing they would ship whatever they made in Korea.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/zenimax-union-workers-ratify-historic-contract-with-microsoft" target="_self" data-discover="true">ZeniMax union workers ratify historic contract with Microsoft</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To clarify, the game jam IS the game," he explains. "By the end of the month, the core gameplay was basically done and all that was left was to hook up the rest of the user experience, add meta-progression elements, and sneak in the banana peel. We avoided scope creep by having a built-in ship date: midsummer. I'm here now in Sweden to visit Landfall for the annual Swedish celebration, and we spent the first week of the trip putting the finishing touches on the game and launching it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was essentially in the bag, Aggro Crab and Landfall had to decide how to market and sell the title. That required both studios to place their trust in their community managers, who had spent years nurturing communities on TikTok, YouTube, Twitter, and Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We knew we'd be able to reach our audience," says Kaman, who explains the confidence both studios had in their community managers' ability to connect with their playerbase was partly why they chose to unveil and launch </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the space of five days.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You only really need to announce early to build up enough hype for that initial spark, but if you already know you’ll have that, then it’s just up to whether the game is good enough to turn that spark into a raging campfire," he adds. "We couldn’t have predicted this insane of a response of course! I think the large launch discount (38 percent) and the inherent virality of the game also helped make it easy to convince your friends to all pick it up"</span></p><p>Image via Aggro Crab / Landfall</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing pricing in more detail, Kaman says launching for less than $5 made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a very tantalizing "impulse spend." He explains that most players were pleasantly surprised at the scope and depth of the title considering the low price point and confirms the both studios subsequently broke even in a matter of hours.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We thought if we were lucky it would eventually do half as well as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We broke even in the first few hours. Now that a week has passed we're at 1.6 million copies. It's absolutely bonkers and none of us expected it," Kaman continues. "We are freaking out. We knew we had a decent shot of success because of our platforms but this level of attention has been completely unprecedented for us. We’re attributing this win to the Power of Friendship."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indeed, this is the second viral hit Landfall has delivered after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-nets-8-8m-players-in-two-months#">sold 2.2 million copies and attracted 8.8. million players in two months</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The reason for the discrepancy in those numbers is simple: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched as a free-to-keep title for a full day. That lead to around 6.2 million people downloading the co-op horror title in 24 hours and over 200,000 concurrent users on Steam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Landfall and Aggro Crab considered doing something similar with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Peak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but ultimately decided it would be tough to replicate the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We found out recently that a lot of games have tried [that same approach] since [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Content Warning</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launched] and failed to hit the same level of success. We were anxious about whether we’d get results without a bold strategy like that, but this probably resulted in way more revenue than if we had done the free day," notes Kaman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Landfall and Aggro Crab are sharing the spoils, Kaman explains both companies are taking cuts as co-publishers of the game. Each individual who worked on the project is also receiving their fair share. That sounds pretty peak to us.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Sony is being sued in a Dutch class action lawsuit over artificially inflated prices on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has been filed by Dutch non-profit organisation Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument on behalf of 1.7 million Dutch PlayStation users.</p>
<p>The organisation has accused Sony of "abusing its dominant position in the console market for at least a decade", according to a press release shared with Eurogamer. Due to the increased prevalence of digital sales and digital-only consoles, the organisation claims Sony has a monopoly over digital sales - what it has dubbed a "Sony Tax".</p>
<p>The lawsuit is part of the organisation's <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/">"Fair PlayStation" campaign</a>, which it launched in February and attracted over 20,000 participants in its first week.</p>
<p>"Many people have noticed they're increasingly being pushed towards 'digital-only' consoles since the arrival of the latest PS5 generation," said Lucia Melcherts, chair of Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument.</p>
<p>"These consoles work exclusively with digital games rather than physical discs. Yet economic research shows that consumers pay on average 47 percent more for a digital version of a game compared to an identical physical copy - even though Sony's distribution costs are significantly lower."</p>
<p>In April this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of its PS5 console once again</a> in multiple countries, including the UK and across Europe. Now, the PS5 Digital Edition costs £40 or €50 more, which Sony blamed on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p>
<p>"The fact that Sony dares to raise prices by double digits without offering anything meaningful in return speaks volumes," said Melcherts. "Sony is the sole provider of digital content on the world’s most popular gaming console. With more than 80 percent of Dutch console owners using a PlayStation, Sony is free to make decisions with little regard for competitors, developers, or consumers."</p>
<p>In the summons sent to Sony by Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, there are two core accusations: the exclusion of competition, and the exploitation of consumers and game developers. The organisation claims PlayStation players are entirely dependent on Sony and its prices due to its closed ecosystem, while developers have limited commercial freedom with Sony setting prices.</p>
<p>Due to this "imbalance", Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument claims consumers are paying a premium - resulting in estimated damages in the Netherlands of up to €435m.</p>
<p>A first hearing will take place later this year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">legal claim made in the UK in 2022</a> by ex-managing director of Which UK Alex Neill, filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal. It claimed Sony was in breach of competition law due to a 30 percent commission on digital games and in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/5bn-lawsuit-over-unfair-playstation-prices-may-continue-tribunal-rules">lawsuit was then given the go ahead in 2023</a>, and <a href="https://woodsford.com/woodsford-funded-5bn-class-action-against-sony-playstation-gets-go-ahead-in-uk-competition-appeal-tribunal/">earlier this year was given the green light to proceed to trial</a>.</p>
<p>Others in the industry have also received lawsuits over perceived monopolies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite recently returned to iOS devices in the US and Europe</a> following a lengthy battle between Epic and Apple over the latter's restrictions on purchasing methods. Meanwhile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition">Microsoft settled a lawsuit from players attempting to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> due to a perceived monopoly over the industry.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-in-netherlands-over-sony-tax-and-its-perceived-monopoly-on-digital-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>You survived a killer before, and somehow, you've found yourself in another hunted situation. You keep trying to save the others, but what's hunting you is too quick, and as before, you're the only one left. Once again, you are the final girl.</em></p>

<p><em>Final Girl</em>, by Van Ryder Games, was an acclaimed Kickstarter launched in 2020, based on their already successful <em>Hostage Negotiator</em>&nbsp;system. Since its release, it's had 2 more Kickstarters, each combined into a series of releases. In this review, we will look at the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box, which incorporates everything from Series 2 available at retail into a single handy storage box. If you want to know how to play <em>Final Girl</em>, check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, because in this article, we'll just be looking at the Series 2 contents&nbsp;and what our favorite parts of it are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=kDZp_mlO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=6HZZt47C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box isn't incuded in the Series 2 Ultimate Box, but is in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, or can be picked up seperately for use with the Series 2 Ultimate Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Rules To Survive A Horror Movie Sequel</h2>

<p><i>Final Girl</i>&nbsp;is a modular system that begins with the <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box, which has the core rules and components. To play, a core box is combined with a feature film box, like Happy Trails Horror or Slaughter in the Groves. These feature film boxes include a unique killer, a unique location, and 2 final girls to choose from, which can all be mixed and matched with other feature film boxes in any combination of final girl, location, and killer to diversify your games as your collection expands.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box doesn't include a <em>Final Girl </em>Core Box. So if you don't have the Series 1 Ultimate Box, you will need to pick up a Core Box separately. This is to avoid duplication, as the Ultimate Boxes are designed for players who want everything. If you want to try out <em>Final Girl</em>, pick up a Core Box and a feature film to test the experience first, and then if you love it, then the Ultimate Boxes are going to be for you.</p>

<h2>What's Your Favorite Scary Movie Sequel?</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box contains a huge amount of content. We'll detail here what each item contains and talk about our favorite products from the Ultimate Box below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=z_KZBf1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=Bfc8Rn1V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the Core Box, the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a load of upgrades and content add-ons.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props</h4>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props includes a load of upgraded and extra components for <em>Final Girl</em>. It includes deluxe tokens for the horror track, bloodlust, and time, and solid plastic tokens for final health. It also includes a desperation dice, which you can choose to roll once per game instead of a red die for a 5 in 6 chance of an extra success, but a 1 in 6 chance of immediately losing. If you lose because of the desperation die, you can look up how you died in the included book of desperate deaths.</p>

<p>4 promo final girls are also included in the box, Layla, Agnes, and 2 tie-in characters from the upcoming <em>The Dark Quarter</em> game, Julia and Constance. They don't get special envelopes or miniatures in this box though, they come in the Series 3 Ultimate Box (I would have liked to see it all packaged up in this box together). Some new rules are also added for the characters, with signature action cards, which can be added to the game and function like normal action cards, and a choice of ultimate dice, which can be taken instead of unlocking your final girl's ultimate ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=Crh8IQoX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=k6dbWSHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes 5 new feature film boxes, with new locations, killers and final girls.</figcaption></figure><h4>Final Girl Feature Films Boxes</h4>

<p>The Series 2 Ultimate Box, like the first one, contains 5 feature film boxes, for a total of 5 locations, 5 killers, and 10 final girls (with 5 additional final girls and another killer we detail above and below) that can all be mixed and matched between sets. Each box also contains miniatures for the killer, to upgrade from the token in the core box and vehicles (that you can access with cards in the item and event decks), to upgrade from the tokens included in each feature film box. We'll discuss each feature film box below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Into the Void</strong></p>

<p>Into The Void is <em>Final Girl's</em> take on Alien, with the USS Konrad as the location, which has key card required access cards to move between parts of the ship, and the Evomorph as a killer that evolves over the course of the game. Ellen and Jenette are the final girls in this film box, with Ellen's ultimate always letting her find what she needs, and Jenette getting extra uses out of limited items. I love that this set includes the Super Loader (and miniature in the Ultimate Box) for enhanced combat damage when looking to take the fight to the Evomorph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Panic at Station 2891</strong></p>

<p>Panic at Station 2891 includes Station 2891 as a remote location that has a helicopter on a timer as the only way to save victims. It also includes indoor and outdoor spaces that use the rule for frostbite, should you or the victims stay in the elements too long. The Organism is the killer in this set, and it has 3 different variations. 3 victims may have been assimilated, and as many as all 3 could be an Organism. The final girls are Uki and Kate. Uki's ultimate is to always be considered to have the Guard card that can reduce damage, and Kate jumps back to full health when revealing her ultimate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: A Knock at the Door</strong></p>

<p>A Knock at the Door has the Wingard Cottage as its location, which gives you access to crafting mechanics to combine items into more powerful weapons. The Intruders are the killers here, with 3 killers on the board, with only the active killer performing actions, until an All Killers card is drawn. Ava and Ginny are the final girls here, with Ava's ultimate letting you reroll a blank (1) horror roll, and Ginny's ultimate boosting her actions for the rest of the game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Once Upon a Full Moon</strong></p>

<p>Once Upon a Full Moon takes a fantasy turn with the Storybook Woods as the location, which is much smaller than other locations, and requires you to cross poorly built bridges or find the raft. The Big Bad Wolf is the killer, and has 2 different modes, track and slay, with actions depending on which mode they are in. The fantastically thematic Red and Gretel are the final girls in this set, with Red's ultimate letting her move if an enemy is within 2 spaces, and Gretel's ultimate converting a blank (2) horror roll to a star by discarding action cards.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Madness in the Dark</strong></p>

<p>Madness in the Dark takes place at the Wolfe Asylum location, which has risk-reward medicine and drugs that can help you against the killer. The killer in this set is the Ratchet Lady, who can turn victims into maniacs to help her hunt you down. Veronica and Heather are the final girls, with Veronica's ultimate resetting the time to 7 at the end of the planning phase, and Heather's ultimate letting her reroll 5 or 6 on the horror roll, and boosting her attacks for each success.</p>

<p>The game mat bundle includes 2 neoprene game mats that have space for all the game areas, including the killer and location boards, horror and time track, and card deck areas, and comes in a thematic VCR-style box. These mats are slightly different from the Series 1 mats, and have more spaces for cards and components, but at the cost of things being a little more cramped together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=gA5Owel1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=1pricLq8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Following the same format as the&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box, the Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a whole host of extras to add more depth to your games.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Bonus Features Box</h4>

<p>Along with the Feature and Core boxes, the Ultimate Box includes 2 other sets, the first is the Bonus Features Box, which includes several books:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Feature Films Rulebook&nbsp;- This handy book features all the killer and location looseleaf rules inserts from each of the Series 2&nbsp;feature films, along with some achievement sheets for each, and works the same way as the Series 1 book.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Gruesome Death Books - These 5&nbsp;books for each location contain gruesome details of kills for each terror card and some general death details, for each of the Series 2&nbsp;killers across the Series 2&nbsp;locations.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Lore Book Series 2 - The lore book contains background details for all of the Series 2&nbsp;killers and final girls, along with some detailed setup for some linked scenario games</li>
</ul><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Cast and Crew Box</h4>

<p>The other bonus set in the Ultimate Box is the The Series 2 Cast and Crew, which is a handy storage box for some additional components, and to gather up all the final girl stat cards and their secret envelopes (which you can open for a bonus card once you complete a game with that final girl). The box also contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl </em>Miniatures - All of the killer miniatures are housed in their respective feature film boxes, but all of the final girl miniatures are here.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Terror from the Grave (vignette) - This fantastic little box contains a killer (zombies) but doesn't include a specific location (and as with all killers, can be used with any location you wish). It also includes a new final girl (who also has a miniature in this box), Patsy, whose ultimate allows her to spend 2 time to deal 2 damage.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Zombies Miniatures Pack - These miniatures replace the tokens in the Terror from the Grave vignette pack.</li>
</ul><h2>A Bloody Combination</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box further adds an insane amount of variety in locations and killers, if added to the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but still stands alone and can simply be added to a Core Set if you just want to play the Feature Films in this box. Having to pick up the Core Set separately makes sense, as does the miniatures for the 2 tie-in final girls from <em>The Dark Quarter </em>(which I love, as the final girls are powerful and the tie in is handled well), but not having the miniatures and secret envelopes for the other 2 extra final girls who's promo cards are included feels off, and having to buy the Series 3 Ultimate Box to get them doesn't sit well. If you're a huge fan of <em>Final Girl</em>, you're probably picking it up anyway, but for something called the Ultimate Box, it doesn't feel very ultimate.</p>

<p>Aside from that, some of the content here is fantastic. Into the Void and Panic at Station 2891 are incredible, with thematic locations and killers, and the zombies from Terror from the Grave are fun. But it's Once Upon a Full Moon that's my favorite part of the content. The fairy tale horror includes my favorite location, killer and final girls so far.</p>



<p>If you've read the above and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, you'll know that I'm a fan of the <em>Final Girl</em> mechanics and the sheer depth of variety that a single Ultimate Box can give you. Having 2 Ultimate Boxes just increases that, but will also stand on its own (with the addition of a Core Box with the Series 2 Ultimate Box).</p>

<p>I love the originality of the core horror feature films in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but the Series 2 Ultimate Box is easily my pick of the 2, with Into the Void and Panic a Station 2891 being great experiences, but Once Upon a Full Moon being my favorite. The missing miniatures and sealed envelopes for 2 promo final girls sours it a little (they're in the Series 3 Ultimate Box), but the 2 tie in characters from A Dark Quarter are fantastic (but you will have to pick up a copy of that game for the miniatures - which we'll review when released).&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-update-new-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-three-more-old-school-worms-games.1229001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>on consoles, bringing three more retro&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>titles to the collection, as well as a new cheat code that will be familiar if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the "Backworms Compatible Update" adds the SNES and Genesis (or Mega Drive for some regions) ports of&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, as well as the Game Boy Advance game&nbsp;<em>Worms World Party</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, this update brings the legendary "Boggy B" cheat code for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, which will unlock all of the game's content. This one was added by request of the community, and you can toggle it within the collection's options menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=Ok-hYrk8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=no_y-84N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>now has new&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>games for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, since this is an update specifically for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, this extra stuff isn't coming to the PC version of the game, which is still just the old-fashioned classic&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon&nbsp;</em>release from the mists of 1999.</p>

<p>It's nice to see Team17 still working on updating&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</em>, but it does feel like a shame that the PC version isn't getting the same love. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if the community's voice becomes loud enough to change that.</p>

<p>If you've never played&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>&nbsp;(or its console re-release), it's a classic 1999 strategy game that sees teams of worms battling it out for supremacy using a variety of comically dangerous weapons, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worms-rumble-release-date-playstation-pc-crossplay-beta-announced-" rel="nofollow">many</a> of its franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">stablemates</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>re-release packs in not only the original game (plus modern hardware improvements, natch), but also a digital&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>museum and documentary, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the game.</p>




<p><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009765" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition/9nh5hhr5w9wx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Worms-Armageddon-Anniversary-Edition-2655288.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

More isolationist and feral than other Druid groups, the Druids of the Sharval Wilds unleash primal fury upon their foes, brimming with the chaotic energy of mother nature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521866" data-ratio="0.56260720411664" data-width="1749" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521866"></a><figcaption>Diablo Immortal's Druid is more primal and chaotic than the one seen in Diablo 2 or 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When it came to making Diablo Immortal's Druid stand out from earlier versions, Blizzard looked to the real world for timely inspiration. There's a reason Diablo Immortal's version of the Druid uses wildfire-inducing fire magic and earthquake-creating earth magic, two elements that can spiral out of control and wreak havoc on the surrounding environment.</p><p dir="ltr">"At Blizzard generally, not even just on this team, we talk a lot about what is the right time for this class, what is the right time for this zone?" Diablo Immortal senior narrative designer Ryan Quinn said in an interview with GameSpot. "Knowing that we're going to this densely wooded place where Druids and witches fight over how to share the land…not to channel too much of the fact that I live in southern California, but a wildfire seems very, very poised to create tension and conflict in that environment."</p><p dir="ltr">While the class maintains many of the familiar aspects of the Druid that fans of the class from previous installments will be familiar with--elemental spellcasting, shapeshifting abilities, and animal companions--how Diablo Immortal's Druid actually looks and plays will be quite different. The class puts an emphasis on constantly transitioning between forms, whether it's diving into the fray as a werebear, repositioning and crowd-controlling enemies as the new stag form, or dissolving into a swarm of dive-bombing ravens.</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn said Blizzard knew this new version of the Druid needed to feel different. Part of realizing that goal came in the form of the Druid's new shapeshifting abilities, going beyond the usual werebear and werewolf forms.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to do stuff that's a little more diverse, we didn't want to just do predator forms," Quinn said. "And we wanted it to look and feel more chaotic."</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn used an example of how earlier in development, the Druid simply transformed into a single raven. But that didn't feel powerful enough, so the team instead opted for the Druid to transform into an entire flock of ravens. That line of thinking can be seen throughout the Druid's toolkit, where each ability feels like it's ready to spiral out of control.</p><p dir="ltr">It also translates to the Druid's gameplay. Blizzard's goal was to make Diablo Immortal's Druid more agile than previous versions, lead systems engineer John Yoo said, with an emphasis on constantly shapeshifting.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to encourage people to have dynamic play by swapping in and out of forms, using abilities," Yoo said. "We wanted it to feel very, very active."</p><p dir="ltr">Players don't have to always be swapping in and out of forms and can be successful just playing as more of a straight spellcaster or sticking to one form, Yoo said. While sticking to one playstyle will be "viable," Yoo said those who want to push the class to its limits and maximize their damage will likely want to change forms depending on the situation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861"></a><figcaption>In addition to shapeshifting, Diablo Immortal's Druid can wield primal earth and fire magic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For fans of older versions of Diablo's Druid, there are still some throwbacks to what fans already know. Diablo Immortal's Druid can use fire magic, like in Diablo 2, and has similar summonable companions, like direwolves (although Yoo said the team did experiment with summonable direboars instead). Quinn said since Diablo Immortal takes place between Diablo 2 and 3, the team is always aware of the legacy preceding the mobile ARPG. With that in mind, Blizzard looks to strike a balance when it comes honoring what came before while also making room for new ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">"Occasionally it is take the familiar thing [in] a very familiar direction," Quinn said. "Sometimes, it's just add. Take the familiar thing, but bolt something new and cool onto it that doesn't contradict it. And sometimes it's whole cloth invention."</p><p dir="ltr">One example of that philosophy in action is the return of the Druid's Oak Sage ability. Previously seen in Diablo 2, Oak Sage is back in Diablo Immortal. Instead of a more passive aura like in Diablo 2, the Oak Sage in Diablo Immortal is instead punched up and depicted as a friendly forest fae that boosts players' health and defense but also attacks enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to push the boundaries, make our Druid feel different from other Druids," Yoo said. "While we wanted to keep the inherent theme and nature of the Druid, no pun intended, we still wanted to make it unique, fresh, and distinctly our own in Diablo Immortal."</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of the Druid is just the latest in a series of updates outlined in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-2025-roadmap-reveals-another-new-class-is-on-the-way/1100-6530052/" data-ref-id="1100-6530052">Diablo Immortal's 2025 roadmap</a> Blizzard has dubbed the Epoch of Madness, all of which continue to explore the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-biggest-boss-battle-yet-is-fittingly-against-diablo-himself/1100-6528355/" data-ref-id="1100-6528355">defeat of Diablo last year</a> and the power vacuum left in his wake. A fourth major update currently shrouded in mystery, titled The First &amp; Last King, is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4, meanwhile, continues to evolve, as Blizzard looks to update the ARPG's endgame. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Season 8 overhauled Diablo 4's endgame bosses</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">Season 9 brings permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sega is now the official gaming partner of McLaren Racing, in a multi-year collaboration with Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with Eurogamer, the partnership promises to "fuse the worlds of motorsport and gaming and engage audiences of all ages both on the grid and screen". It's unknown exactly what this will entail, but it's all part of Sonic Team's 2025 "<a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue into 2026, Sonic's 35th anniversary year, as well as the McLaren Formula 1 team's 1,000th Grand Prix race.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time the two companies have joined forces. Back in 1993, the European Grand Prix was held in Donington Park in the UK and was known as the Sonic Grand Prix. McLaren F1 driver Ayrton Senna won the race and received a Sonic the Hedgehog trophy.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Sonic the Hedgehog to the McLaren Racing family," said Louise McEwen, chief marketing officer of McLaren Racing. "This partnership brings together two iconic names in speed, and opens up our team to a wider, younger global audience. Sonic is a character with incredible heritage and a passionate fanbase, and we are very excited to celebrate our partnership at McLaren Racing Live: London."</p>
<p>The McLaren Racing Live event will take place in Trafalgar Square from 2nd - 3rd July.</p>
<p>The collaboration underlines Sega's key release for the year, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The next in the racing series, it features mid-race portals to other worlds to shake up gameplay, as well as including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Hatsune Miku, Persona's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve in its roster of racers</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a Sega Arcade racer, with the mechanical depth and tightened controls you'd expect from that lineage," wrote Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. "It's also a mad party game to boot."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 8.0 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> today for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, adding several features and new content. The main addition is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siege Mode</a>, a new PvE mode that expands on the existing Operations mode to include endless enemy waves that can challenge even the strongest teams. When players are overwhelmed, they can call for reinforcements. They'll engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring a different strategy. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing the resources needed to summon either elite Space Marines or the formidable Dreadnought, which can drastically shift the balance of power on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Compared to the build previously available for testing on the Public Test Server, Saber Interactive has reworked the wave timer limit so that, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can become very short on higher waves, there is now a timer for the entire session. Each time players beat a wave, the timer increases.</p>
<p>The developers of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 have also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves, meaning that enemies will become stronger more quickly after the 15th wave. These changes will ensure players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Additionally, the timer may be entirely removed in the future. Moreover, an option has been introduced to disable bot spawning in Private Mode.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 also received some major technical improvements for the PC version. There's now an experimental ray traced ambient occlusion feature (RTAO) that can be toggled on in the graphics settings, and NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is now fully supported, delivering better visuals with the latest transformer model and faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>

<p>There are also many other balance tweaks and additions in the patch. Last but not least, Saber said they are preparing a significant update to the customization system, which will let players reuse chapter champion armor parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping, and technical restrictions). This will be in a future update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 7 million units sold, and the developers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-gets-august-release-date.1228977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Umami Tiger and publisher Deck13 have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the upcoming story expansion DLC for the JRPG-inspired throwback&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will launch across all platforms on August 7th, and that's also when you'll be able to purchase the soundtrack for the DLC if you're musically inclined.</p>

<p>As Umami Tiger (which is essentially just a moniker for solo dev Matthias Linda) says,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled to arrive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025" rel="nofollow">in the second quarter of the year</a>, but "game development is complicated".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=PzOgomru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=vvQzRXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Echoes</em>'&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is arriving in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Linda says that while the DLC itself was ready for release at the end of Q2, "translations were not", and more testing was additionally needed in order to "iron out the last small issues" with&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;you'll get for your money (since&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>isn't a free DLC), it'll add "more of what you enjoyed so much" the first time around.</p>

<p>You'll be getting a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf, a vicious fighter with plenty of damaging moves to test out. Additionally, you can look forward to new areas to visit, as well as "over 40 new enemies and bosses" to battle.</p>

<p>More music will, of course, be added to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC, and you can also expect new gear to collect and new minigames to try out. All in all, if you liked&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, you'll probably want to give this a look.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a throwback JRPG inspired by classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>and SNES-era&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>games. Developed by solo creator Matthias Linda, the game takes you to a "fantasy world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits".</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can take a look at our very own Isaac's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/chained-echoes-review" rel="nofollow">review from back in 2022 right here</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ok, so you remember how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> arrived on PC and immediately there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">more smutty mods</a> than you could shake a fleshy stick at?</p>
<p>Well, the new Zone Kit modding tools <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> got as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">yesterday's big patch</a> have done something similar, but with memey jank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd expect given the Zone Kit takes up a very small 700GB of your hard drive and only came out the other day, there aren't too many mods out there that make use of it. However, taking a glance at how its <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2?date_live=Last+year">Mod.IO</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1643320/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> pages are building up at this early stage, there are still a number of works that'll, er, transform your zoning experience.</p>
<p>Homing in on Mod.IO specifically, 19 of the 61 mods currently up on there are by the same author, Sanekum, whom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-artist-kickstarts-the-zone-kit-modding-scene-with-a-flood-of-glorious-nonsense-mods-featuring-shrek-cj-and-you-guessed-it-thomas-the-tank-engine/">PC Gamer</a> note looks like they could be GSC 3D Artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sanekum">Aleksandr Silantev</a>.</p>
<p>That 31.15% (I have double checked the maths) of the total Stalker mods on the platform include the likes of <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/swampboss2#description">Shrek</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/cj-bloodsucker#description">CJ</a> from San Andreas cameos, but as a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-i-saw-her">serious</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">journalist</a> I'm interested in keeping things <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>. To that end, Sanekum offers the chance to pick up an <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/rpg-melee-combat#description">RPG grenade</a>, or an even deadlier <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/melee-nettle-branch#description">nettle branch</a>, and attempt to beat to death some <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sherman-boar#description">Sherman tanks</a> that've been drafted in to replace boars.</p>
<p>What do you mean that's not <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>? Clearly the Sherman tanks are being operated by the boars, who've just been magicked inside of them and given the sort of army training required to operate an armoured fighting vehicle with their little hooves. In the same way that <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sidorovich-handgun#description">this mod</a> which turns a mini-Sidorovich into a handgun makes perfect anatomical sense.
</p>
<p>Aside from those, a fair few of these early Mod.IO works for Stalker look to be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1312">existing</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/634">things</a> from places like Nexus Mods being <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/weapon-reposition-project-tacticool#description">ported</a> <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/main-menu-animated-ferris-wheel-4k60fps#description">across</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be cool to see what Stalker's notoriously enthusiastic modding community can get up to once they've had time to buy an entire new PC just to ensure they've got the space needed to install the Zone Kit and a chance to play around with it properly. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-some-nettles-defeat-wild-pigs-in-sherman-tanks-thanks-to-stalker-2s-new-modding-tools-you-can-find-out]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> has seen a big boost in players after launching its first new class, but complaints over monetization have continued especially after developer Fatshark released a version of the Arbitrator's default helmet with its visor up for $5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-warhammer-40000-darktide-battle-for-tertium-update-goes-live-alongside-new-class-the-adeptus-arbites">Battle for Tertium update</a>, which arrived alongside the new Adeptus Arbites class DLC, reworked the core player experience to provide a new, clearer narrative focus for the co-op first-person melee / shooter hybrid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. It’s designed to “ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level,” Fatshark has said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big draw for veteran players was the release of the Adeptus Arbites class, and it appears to have done the trick. This $11.99 DLC looks like it’s sparked the interest of players who have stuck with the game since its troubled launch, as well as convinced lapsed players to dip back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch, Darktide hit a peak concurrent player count of just over 43,000 on Steam, the highest it’s been on Valve’s platform for over two years. And this doesn’t even paint the whole picture of the game’s success, given it’s also out on console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement provided to IGN, Product Marketing Manager Rodrigue Delrue said Fatshark had noticed the uptick, but failed to say exactly how many were playing Darktide across PC and console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen a high level of engagement across all platforms, even if we don't have exact numbers to share at this time,” Delrue said. “What’s important is that the community remains active and passionate, and we’re incredibly thankful for that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/ss-ab7a23b22d0485c18ca39f259f38bef8d1f9d745-1920x1080-1750940682493.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Arbitrator's default helmet has its visor down. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is one sticking point: monetization. Darktide’s Adeptus Arbites DLC launched alongside a fresh round of premium cosmetics, bought with the in-game currency called Aquilas (the Aquila is the ancient symbol of the Imperium of Man in the Warhammer 40,000 universe). And within that monetization debate, one item in particular has set the community off: a helmet with its visor up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This helmet, specifically for the Arbitrator, is identical to the default visor-down helmet you get with the new class. So, you’re paying 900 Aquilas (approx. $5) just to lift your visor up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/screenshot-2025-06-26-125015-1750940732879.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Arbitrator's patrol helm with raised visor costs $5. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d imagine, this hasn’t gone down well with some Darktide players. “We've reached the current peak of Fatshark greed,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1ljb3we/i_think_weve_reached_the_current_peak_of_fs_greed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one thread on the Darktide subreddit</a>, upvoted 3,000 times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it’s bulls**t that this wasn’t just included alongside the otherwise identical default visor-down helmet,” said one player. “Just give me a button push that lets me do this,” suggested another. “I’m just glad the visor up isn’t default and they make you pay for down,” joked one fan. “You mean I have to pay extra to actually see my character’s ugly face? I was buying skins to cover it up.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put the complaints about this cosmetic and Darktide’s monetization generally to Fatshark, and Delrue explained the studio needs to sell items in order to continue working on the game, but took the feedback on board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cosmetic pricing is always a balancing act,” Delrue said. “As a live service game we want to be able to keep working on the game while respecting what players feel is fair value. We appreciate when these topics are brought up, these conversations help us better understand what the community values and helps inform how we approach cosmetics going forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, how much longer will Fatshark continue to work on adding new content to Darktide, which is approaching its third birthday? Delrue pointed to the studio’s continued support of the even older Warhammer game, Vermintide, as evidence of its commitment to its players, and even confirmed more new classes are on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since launch, we’ve continuously supported Darktide with free updates — and that commitment isn’t changing,” Delrue said. “As we’ve shown with Vermintide, we’re in this for the long haul. Players can naturally expect ongoing support, including new classes and additional free content as the game continues to evolve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Remember the turtles? Well, well…), gorgeous pixel art and finally a fishing minigame. Which isn’t mini. Trust us.</p><p>The “<a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>son Wings” are needed once more!</p><p>“Ashes of Elrant” takes players to a new land, away from Valandis. It is set right before the final fight of <em>Chained Echoes</em> so you can prepare yourself for meeting your beloved heroes once again. The Clan of the Crimson Wings has to answer a call for help from the land of Elrant. A land where nothing is as it seems.</p><p>Fans will learn more about the background story of Valandis and also get a deeper look at the characters and their motivations. And with the White Wolf also someone really, really special within the history of Valandis will join the cast.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 launch games ranked" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/807a505b22ace/switch-2-launch-games-ranked.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">Switch 2's software lineup</a> at launch was filled with various known quantities, the breadth and quality of the games featured at the system's 5th June debut made for a very strong offering - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-switch-2-have-nintendos-best-launch-line-up-ever">perhaps one of the best of any console launch ever</a>.</p>
<p>We've done our best since the hardware's launch to review as many of its games as possible, and you can find our verdicts in the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2">S2 reviews</a>. Today, though, we're turning to you to answer the question: <em>What was the Switch 2's best launch game?</em></p>
<p>The ranking here includes every Switch 2 launch game in the West and is based on User Reviews in our database. With a catalogue of games this strong, even the ones towards the bottom may still be very, very good, and you may be surprised where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — the first-party jewel in Switch 2's crown — ends up, too.</p>
<p>So, let's see what we've got at the bottom, shall we?</p>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="25 to 21" id="top-25">25. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Under no circumstances is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, we struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">24. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> is a thoroughly competent, cosy game of cooperative gathering and crafting. It’s not much of a looker, and its ideas aren’t mind-blowing, but it’s all good stuff thanks to its robust controls and easy-to-grasp loop.</p>
<p>We're not sure we’d want to be stuck with it on a desert island, but it’s good company for several happy hours with a friend – especially a less experienced gamer.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">23. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on Switch 2 fixes all glaring — and not so glaring — issues with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">the Switch 1 version</a> of the game. This is a huge package of activities; from battle royale to survival game, racing, creative modes, music festivals, and more besides. It's a lot, and it now runs at 60fps with crisp, clean resolutions all round.</p>
<p>Mouse mode controls are a revelation, loading times are hugely improved, graphics look very nice indeed, thanks, and, well, I reckon this is now the best way to play this one, regardless of a slight downgrading in visuals.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">21. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Arcade Archives 2: Ridge Racer (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>While it lacks the additional content seen in the PS1 port, the original arcade iteration of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> remains a landmark release in the history of the racing genre, and it's just as gripping and playable today as it was back in 1993.</p>
<p>The ability to compete for high scores online adds massively to this version's staying power, and while its long-term appeal does have a fairly low ceiling, it's easily worth the modest asking price just to experience the primal satisfaction you get from pulling off a perfect power slide.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="20 to 11" id="top-20">20. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Whether you should take a punt on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> for the Switch 2 will depend on whether you already own it on Switch 1 or not. If you don’t, it's perhaps Sonic's best 3D game, and this is undoubtedly the best way to play it on Nintendo systems.</p>
<p>If you do, however, you should think twice about double-dipping. It’s already a splendid game on Switch 1, and with no upgrade path or new content, you're missing out on very little if you skip it. Personally, we'd wait for a sale if you absolutely cannot live without those 60 frames per second.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">19. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a> is a solid update of one of Square’s finest modern turn-based RPGs. Its combination of a flexible job system, dynamic combat, and unexpectedly interesting story makes for an adventure that no fans of the JRPG genre will want to miss out on, especially any such fans that enjoyed Team Asano’s more recent work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> duology.</p>
<p>That in mind, there isn’t really anything <em>new</em> in this remaster that justifies the price of a double dip—if you already put a lot of time into this one on the 3DS back in the day, we’d caution you to first consider just how badly you want to spend your money on what ultimately amounts to little more than a nice visual bump.</p>
<p>All the same, Bravely Default was and still is a great RPG; if you haven’t had the chance to give this one a shot yet, this port is a great way to see what the fuss is about.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> is a stunning collection of games that sees Agent 47 at his absolute best. With multiplayer aspects woven seamlessly and smartly into the mix, tons of ways to approach every mission, and some of the best level design in the biz, this is a bonafide belter, no questions asked.</p>
<p>However, this Switch 2 port — as things stand at launch — does need some work to fix its stuttering issues, especially in docked mode, as they are just a little too notable for comfort. Still highly playable, but with some performance problems, then. Let's hope we see improvements in the form of a patch or two ASAP.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">17. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a> was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, as well, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">15. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2 is a cracker, and in portable mode, it could well become my preferred way to play this fantastic entry in Capcom's storied franchise. The only fly in the ointment with this port is 30fps fights in World Tour. It's a shame, and it's 100% gonna be a dealbreaker for some.</p>
<p>But if you can overlook that, the rest of what's here is crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped. All other modes are fully featured and running at 60fps, and online works a treat.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">14. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition">NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Awakening Complete Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>A little more resolution is always going to be useful in a strategy game, and that's true for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition">Nobunaga's Ambition Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>This 'Complete Edition' builds on the Switch 1 foundation by adding a half dozen new scenarios and all the previously released DLC, plus Mouse Mode functionality and 4K support giving you a better look at the battlefield and more precise control over your campaigns.</p>
<p>If you liked the base game on Switch, the Switch 2 additions enhance the experience in exactly the way you'd expect and hope, arguably fulfilling the game's potential on the handheld hybrid where it struggled before.</p>

<p>At first, this doesn't quite feel like the reinvention of Mario Kart that people wanted or expected, but the more time you spend in the open world and racing with friends, you’ll uncover a mechanically rich kart racer full of secrets and joy. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> refines and expands the formula in meaningful ways while upping the charm in many others.</p>
<p>Few games have brought as much laughter as this one since launch. If you need a pick-me-up, Mario Kart World is sure to bring a smile, and it feels like a perfect start to Switch 2's life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Landfall and Aggro Crab have announced another big sales milestone for indie climbing sim&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, and the two studios have also released a sneak preview of what you can expect for the game in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam update</a>,&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has hit the two million sales mark, which means that the game has picked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-1m-sales-first-week" rel="nofollow">since Monday</a>. That's pretty impressive stuff.</p>

<p>In terms of what's next for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, Landfall and Aggro Crab say they're "now looking into possible updates", and that while no information is available about what will be contained in these updates yet, the two studios are paying attention to the community's feedback in terms of changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/peak-sales-2m-volcano.jpg?itok=E6r9c4Ku 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/peak-sales-2m-volcano.jpg?itok=sGEO9-8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone in just a few extra days.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the two studios, "bug fixes and stability" are still the priority over anything new, so you shouldn't expect anything huge just yet. However, Landfall and Aggro Crab do say that more localization is coming soon.</p>

<p>As well as future updates, merchandise for&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>is also in the works; Landfall and Aggro Crab say they didn't expect&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>to take off the way it did, but that thanks to the community's "excitement", some "pretty great things" are afoot for&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>merch.</p>

<p>More bug fixes and stability tweaks are, of course, also on the way for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>. Issues the two studios are aware of right now include disconnection and reconnection problems, performance and optimization hitches, and audio issues, plus more.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, it's a physics-y climbing sim along the lines of games like&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>A Difficult Game About Climbing</em>.</p>

<p>You and your friends (or just you, but the game is best experienced alongside others) will scale a treacherous mountain to reach the top, and each day, the mountain's layout will change, providing a fresh challenge every time.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

I finished it. I reached its terrible ending after pushing through countless bugs, horrible performance issues, and so many boring phone calls. And yet, after all that, if you were to ask me, “Who was <em>MindsEye </em>designed for?” I wouldn’t have an answer for you. Maybe it was designed for people who like to gawk at wastes of money and talent?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197585" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="120" data-playlist="197585,197589,197586" data-current="197585"><div><p>A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23106.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cpr-mini-game-hot-fix-coming-1851784478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cpr-mini-game-hot-fix-coming-1851784478"><em>MindsEye</em></a></span> is far too linear to be a good open-world game, and yet it’s also too big and boring to be a fun, fast-paced linear action game. Instead, <em>MindsEye </em>is a collection of various ideas, some good and many bad, molded roughly into the shape of video games you’ve played before, but missing most of what made those games good. It’s bad, yes, and in the worst way possible. It doesn’t swing for the fences and fail in a fashion you can respect and which might at least make it memorable. Instead, it’s a very expensive, below-average, somewhat pretty but totally bland...<em>thing</em> that is completely forgettable and dreadfully boring. </p><h2 id="h85248"><a id=""></a>So, what is <em>MindsEye</em>?</h2><p>Here’s the basic setup for <em>MindsEye</em>: You play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a weird cybernetic implant in his brain. During a mission, things go south and a lot of people die, which is mostly blamed on Diaz and his implant. Years later, he gets a job at Silva Corp, the company behind his implant. They are set up in Redrock City, which is this game’s version of Las Vegas, complete with a big dome in the middle of the place. Diaz wants answers from Silva Corp, and eventually his quest for the truth becomes entangled in a plot that involves AI, an evil general, rich tech bros, interdimensional beings, and super robots. </p><p>That might sound cool. Maybe even exciting? Sadly, <em>MindsEye </em>somehow turns this bonkers plotline into one of the dullest things I’ve played in years. </p><p>You want to know what I spent most of my time doing in <em>MindsEye</em>? It wasn’t fighting baddies using the game’s unremarkable cover-based combat system which feels ripped directly out of <em>GTA V</em>. Nor was it causing chaos in big chase scenes against police or robots. Instead, about 60 percent of this game is spent driving to locations and calling people to chat about what happened, what is going to happen, and what will happen after that. It’s the most tedious way to deliver exposition and build out the world. </p><p>And sure, <em>GTA </em>games often do similar drive-and-talk sequences, but they’re usually very short and are sprinkled throughout bombastic missions that take place in highly interactive open worlds. By contrast, in <em>MindsEye</em>, you can’t even steal random cars during missions. At one point, my car got stuck on a rock so I went to steal a parked vehicle. Can’t do that. I shot at a car and the driver got out. I went to get in. Nope. Then one of the characters on my phone call yelled at me for taking too long to drive to the next boring cutscene. </p><h2 id="h85249"><a id=""></a>A beautiful but boring playground</h2><p>To developer Build A Rocket Boy’s<em>&nbsp;</em>credit, <em>MindsEye</em> looks wonderful. Character models are high quality, textures look great, and the lighting in some areas is very realistic. It all runs like crap, especially if more than a few cars are on screen at once, but Redrock City is rendered quite well. Driving around the place during the game’s 12- to 15-hour campaign, I spotted people camping, abandoned locations, police helping people out of a car wreck, and so much more. </p><p>It’s a real shame that there’s no reason to actually <em>explore</em> the city during <em>MindsEye</em>. You can’t even start shooting cops to get a wanted level. It’s a fabulously rendered playground that’s about as interactive as a picture of Las Vegas on your phone.</p><p>When you finish <em>MindsEye </em>you get a final cutscene that doesn’t answer any of your questions or resolve any of the game’s, like, six dangling plot threads, and then you get a post-credits scene that—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">especially following the horrible reviews the game’s received and reported layoffs at the developer</a></span>—feels very presumptuous to have included. Yeah, I’m sure, we’ll be getting more <em>MindsEye </em>one day...</p><p>I mean, I guess we will, because the game includes (or will include) user-generated missions set in Redrock City using <em>MindsEye’s </em>assets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">The plan is for PC players to make new missions and game types</a></span> and so on, and then for the devs to pick the best and share them with everyone. For now, though, it’s just missions made by the team behind <em>MindsEye</em>. These missions sometimes appear in the campaign, letting you take a break from talking to people while you drive for five minutes to instead shoot some “gangbangers” as a merc or fight off cops to learn more about how criminals live. I uh, didn’t like any of these missions, and I’m not expecting many fans are going to be designing stuff for me to play in the future. </p><h2 id="h85250"><a id=""></a>Here’s your reward: A bad open world</h2><p>Once you wrap <em>MindsEye </em>and roll your eyes at the terrible ending, you unlock an open-world mode that lets you freely explore Redrock City. However, you’re stuck playing as a weird dude in a gas mask, and the city is filled with the most boring, cookie-cutter missions you can imagine. It feels like something added at the last minute because the folks involved knew people would complain about not having an open-world mode. </p><p>Here’s how slapdash this mode is: Your character makes the same noises as Jacob, and it doesn’t even have a map to look at when you pause the action.</p><figure id="" data-id="043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-recommend-id="image://043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-recommend-id="image://043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What do you do in this mode? You mostly drive to highlighted spots, shoot 20 people, grab a thing, and bring it back. Or maybe you drive through 40 checkpoints in races that go on way too long. None of these missions have voice acting or new music, or introduce new features. It feels like playing a weird, unfinished mod of <em>MindsEye </em>someone made. And this is your reward for beating the game. Congrats! You can drive around a boring city with no radio stations to listen to and bad missions to complete. Oh, and you still can’t steal most cars in the world, instead being forced to drive around in a white hatchback. </p><p>Like I said at the top, I have no idea who this game is for, and I don’t think it will find an audience. Perhaps after months of updates, <em>MindsEye</em> will run better and feature fewer bugs. But that won’t change how boring, bland, and utterly unremarkable this game is. <em>MindsEye </em>is a bad game that isn’t even so bad it’s good. It’s just bad, and it will probably be forgotten in a few months, only remembered briefly when the game’s servers are shut down with little warning. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108]]></content:encoded>

No sooner had we introduced you to its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-funcom-is-already-testing-a-radical-change-to-the-pvp-deep-desert-experience"><u>Public Test Client and news that the studio was trialling extending the PvE zone of the Deep Desert from about 10% of the map to 50%</u></a>, Funcom has dropped an update to confirm that the change will be rolling out for all players from today, June 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map," Funcom confirmed in its latest <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>patch notes, below</u></a>. "This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future," the team said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It follows an AMA in which the studio told players frustrated by the endgame experience that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>"formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>. Previously, players branded the endgame as "toxic" due to griefing even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>patching out the ability for players to squish other people with their Ornithopter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame," said creative director Joel Bylos. "Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wondering, yes, Control Points and Shipwrecks will continue to be PvP "throughout the entire map," which means you will find "localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin." Work has also begun on changing the Ornithopters; equipping a rocket launcher module will now decrease the top speed of your Scout Orni by 20%, and Assault Ornis by 10%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the patch has been applied, players will also be able to report other players’ messages from the text chat or report them by using the Inspect menu.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dune: Awakening Patch Notes 1.1.0.17</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Deep Desert</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening</u></a>, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert. Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map.<ul data-cy="list"><li>This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE.</li><li>Control Points and Shipwrecks will, however, continue to be PvP throughout the entire map, which means you will find localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin.</li></ul></li><li>To retain the Risk vs Reward setup for the Deep Desert:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The density of resources increases the further north you go. This includes high-density clusters of valuable resources.</li><li>The largest spice fields will also spawn in the north.</li><li>The majority of Control Points will exist in the northern part.</li></ul></li><li>As part of these changes, we have made some balancing adjustments in the Deep Desert:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The lower half of the Deep Desert now offers PvE loot that is balanced toward shared loot and PvE activities. You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a “first come, first served” basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.</li><li>Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones.</li><li>The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.</li><li>The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.</li><li>The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.</li><li>The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.</li><li>The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you’re not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you’re not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Vehicles</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.<ul data-cy="list"><li>For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.</li><li>For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.</li></ul></li><li>Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.</li></ul></li><li>Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).<ul data-cy="list"><li>Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand. The workaround is to try to get on top of the vehicle to interact with it. This will be fixed in the very next patch.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Visiting</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We removed the restrictions when visiting other sietches. Before this change, players had their “home” sietches, and could visit other sietches in their world but couldn’t claim land. Now, any player can go to any sietch in their world and claim land wherever they want.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Technical and stability</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased game stability.</li><li>The latest NVIDIA driver was added to the GPU driver check at the game launch.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Other</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have introduced Player Reporting, allowing players to now report other players’ messages from the text chat or report players from the Inspect menu on players.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">FIXES</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Technical and stability</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>As a continuous effort, we have closed several exploit vulnerabilities.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a specific type of network issue would cause players to be stuck in an infinite loading screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some players could experience a client freeze when traveling between Deep Desert servers.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Combat</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players performing a melee attack could get obstructed by corpses lying on the ground.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">User Interface</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where the guild faction alignment was not localized on the Guild Overview tab.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could encounter a black screen if they skipped the cinematic at “The Wreck of the Hephaestus”.</li><li>Fixed an issue where several Sandbike research schematics failed to mention the Imperial Testing Stations as the primary source.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Travel</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an issue where players could use an ornithopter pilot service to fly from the cities to Hagga Basin if they had arrived in a city with their ornithopter.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Miscellaneous</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>You will no longer lose learned emotes when respec’ing your skill tree.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.

The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, just two days later, Funcom's already testing some pretty radical changes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all comes as Dune: Awakening unveils its <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-public-test-client/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Public Test Client</u></a>, where players can try out the latest patch and features in exchange for accepting builds may have bugs or be a little unstable. As part of efforts to make the endgame more enjoyable, the PvE area near the shield wall has been expanded to cover row A, B, C, D and half of E within the Deep Desert. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare that to how the PvP and PvE are balanced now where <em>only</em> row A is PvE, and that's essentially switching <em>half</em> of the Deep Desert from PvP to PvE. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/that-was-quick-funcom-is-already-testing-a-version-of-dune-awakening-where-the-deep-desert-is-only-50-percent-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> points out, this doesn't necessarily mean this will be applied in the final game — trying out  new ideas is what test servers are for, of course — but it does at least indicate that Funcom was serious about revising the endgame experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.

The survival climb from dehydrated peasant to powerful warlord of Arrakis is a joy almost every step of the way, and the story and worldbuilding filled this nerd with absolute joy.
