            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One week on from the big content update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, adding the new Stella Montis map and more to the game, Embark Studios has released the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, focussing on bug fixes, balance changes, and with a little surprise for good measure.</p>
<p>There’s a few nerfs here, which Embark will need to be rather cautious in leaning on too heavily, as demonstrated by many previous multiplayer games. From the PvP angle, the Venator has been chewing through other players at close range, so its fire rate upgrades have been dropped significantly. Meanwhile, PvE focused players will be disappointed by the explosive damage nerf, which Embark felt was hitting too many parts of larger enemies and making things like the Hullcracker too effective – which you’d want it to be, given how awesome that name is.</p>


<p>Beyond that, it’s mainly bug fixes – stopping ARCs from going outside of maps, fixing a few crashes, and the like.</p>
<p>here’s the full ARC Raiders 1.3.0 patch notes:</p>






<p><b>Deadline</b><wbr></p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Venator</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note: </b>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Explosive Damage</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note:</b> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<hr>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dam Battlegrounds</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Spaceport</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Blue Gate</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Stella Montis</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.<wbr></li>
<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.<wbr></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone within the game's first week on sale.</p>

<p>As announced on social media,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1991397741881356657" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 500,000 sales</a> across all of the platforms on which it's currently available. Given that it's a niche soccer RPG, that's a pretty impressive number for the game's first seven days.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>game in some pretty illustrious company as well; it's sold the same amount as indie hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">"anxiety horror"&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">cozy RPG&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=NvsFBLDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=8TIT053i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has sold half a million copies since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is Level-5's second major hit this year, following the release of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>back in May.</p>

<p>That game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up half a million sales</a> in its first week as well, and it went on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">pass the million mark</a> before a month had elapsed, so here's hoping that the studio's latest will achieve the same result as well.</p>

<p>It's certainly been a long and strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was announced all the way back in 2016 under the name&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven Ares</em>,&nbsp;and in the years between then and now, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, receiving a couple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">name changes</a> along the way.</p>

<p>This is the latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>series, and it follows the journey of new protagonists Destin Billows and Harper Evans, with a story taking place a quarter of a century after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>If you're interested in seeing where that lengthy journey ended up, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/231308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9nvx87zg7wsc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch</a>.</p>

              <p>LEGO make for wonderful gifts during the holidays. The catalog of sets LEGO offers is unthinkably vast, ranging from capturing memorable moments across our favorite media like that of Star Wars or Marvel all the way to simple sets aimed more at adults designed for display. Think those LEGO flower bouquets every slightly nerdy millennial has in their living rooms. This set here leans a little closer to the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">LEGO has a buildable cat on sale right now for 20% off. Not just any cat—a tuxedo cat.</a> This will make the perfect gift for any tuxedo cat owner this upcoming holiday. They’ll put it together and think, “it looks just like Tux!” (every tuxedo cat owner seems to name theirs Tux for some reason. Well anyway, right now this 20% discount will end up shaving $20 off the standard $100 price tag. That brings it down to just $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Holiday Gift for Cat Owners</h2>
<p>This lifelike LEGO cat model is built to actual size, standing over 12.5 inches tall and made from 1,710 pieces to bring to life its distinctive black fur and white underbelly. It makes a wonderful gift for anyone with a passion for animals, art, or design, but especially for cat owners. Particularly those who own a tuxedo cat themselves.</p>
<p>The set is interactive. The cat’s features are all adjustable so you can display yours to your liking. Rotate the head or adjust the ears, paws and tail. You can even reconfigure the cat to have it’s mouth be open or closed. And yes, when it’s open, there is a little pink piece in there so you cat can blep.</p>



<p>Even the eyes are swappable. The set comes with a pair of yellow eyes in addition to a pair of blue eyes, so you can make it match your own cat. Or go for the stunning heterochromia look with one yellow and one blue.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">Ahead of Black Friday, you can grab this tuxedo cat for display from LEGO for a solid $20 off over at Amazon.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[One of Escape from Tarkov’s Endings Will Cost You $6.2 Million]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-tarkov-endings-cost-you-6-2-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-endings-will-cost-you-6-2-million.1359238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is now a fully released game, with Battlestate having pushed out the 1.0 version of the popular extraction shooter on November 15. One of the biggest selling points of the new version is that it has a story that players can work through to attain one of four endings, all of which are notoriously difficult to reach.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, one Escape from Tarkov creator revealed that they’d reached one of those endgame scenarios, and that getting out and escaping from Tarkov via that particular route was going to cost them a whopping <strong>500 million rubles</strong>, which is around $6.2 million.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-endings-are-nails">Escape from Tarkov’s Endings Are Nails</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, warned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-story-will-have-four-endings/">only a small percentage</a> of Escape from Tarkov players would ever successfully reach the game’s ultimate ending. The four endings that have been set up mark a major milestone for the extraction shooter, but many of the game’s fans won’t see them.</p>



<p>We now know why.</p>



<p>In an image uploaded on social media by Tigz, a popular Tarkov creator, it was revealed that one of those endings requires the player to hand over a whopping 500 <strong>million rubles</strong>, which is a staggering, dizzying amount of cash. It’s equivalent to $6.2 million, and the player will need to acquire those funds while spending on everything required to… Well, <em>acquire those funds</em>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For the average player, this ending is almost impassable and unobtainable, as making that much money in Escape from Tarkov takes an immense amount of time, even if you’re a skilled player.</p>



<p>The point of Escape from Tarkov now is to be much more persistent, so it’s probably doable, but it’s a monumental grind that will wear most players down to the bone.</p>







<p>In the comments under the post, some users joked about the objective. One noted that it would be ‘Just a couple thousand good Scav runs.’ While another criticized it, writing, ‘Not even a fun quest or anything, just grinding, what a disappointment.’</p>



<p>Do you think you could stump up half a billion rubles to get out of Tarkov? Let the community know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you could.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Do F1 Skins Come To Fortnite? Release Date, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/f1-skins-fortnite-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-do-f1-skins-come-to-fortnite-release-date-explained.1359232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An F1 collab is speeding its way into Fortnite, giving the community a chance to immortalise another of the world’s most popular franchises. If you’re wheelie excited about this high-octane crossover, the official release date for the Fortnite and F1 content crossover is below and waiting in the pit lane.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s collaboration possibilities are endless. We’re not at the end of Chapter 6 yet, and we’ve already gotten wind of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Battle Pass leak, revealing Back to the Future content</a>! Before we get there, though, it’s time to take this to the track.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the F1 Skins release date in Fortnite, and what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-f1-skins-release-date">Fortnite &amp; F1 Skins Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Full gear. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can expect to see the new F1 Skins arrive in Fortnite in-game on Thursday, November 20.</strong></p>



<p>The content arrives on this date as it coincides with the real-life 2025&nbsp;Las Vegas Grand Prix! All 10 F1 teams will feature in the drop, and you’ll be able to buy the content of your choice from the Fortnite store, as usual.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-f1-skins-amp-content-is-coming-to-fortnite">What F1 Skins &amp; Content Is Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The ‘F1 Cosmetic Team Set’ is the headline addition as part of the exciting Fortnite and F1 crossover.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what F1 had to say on the collab:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[It] will include branded <strong>Outfits</strong>, <strong>Gliders</strong>, and <strong>Pickaxes </strong>that feature bespoke team branding from all 10&nbsp;Formula 1 teams. The Outfits and cosmetic items are inspired by the current F1 teams, and players can also get Formula 1 branded ‘<strong>Back Bling</strong>’, plus an ‘<strong>Emote</strong>’ to celebrate Victory Royales in style.</p>




</blockquote>



<p>You can only imagine the confusion of the F1 consultant writing up this statement, likely trying to work out what Back Bling is, but they summed it up nicely. It’s all the usual skins, Gliders, Pickaxes, and more, that we’ve become accustomed to with all collaborations.</p>



<p>It’s also unlikely that Epic will suddenly drop the V-Bucks requirements for these bundles. Expect to part with a hefty wad of Fortnite cash if you want to sport a smart Red Bull Outfit or drop into the game with a Mercedes-embroidered Glider.</p>



<p>Who is your F1 team of choice? Is there any gear that will be a must-buy for you when it drops? Share your allegiance to the world via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Official Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is once again expecting big profits despite an expected slowdown in licensing revenue from blockbuster video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as 2024's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Games Workshop and Amazon finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3 is also in development.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/tradingupdate201125" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading update</a>, the Nottingham, UK-based tabletop wargame company said it now expects revenues of at least £310 million for the six months to the end of November 2025, which would amount to a 15% rise from the same period last year. Pre-tax profit is expected to be about £135 million for the half year, up from £126.8 million last year. Shares in Games Workshop were up 12.8% on the news this morning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s despite expected licensing revenue of at least £16 million, which would be down from the £30.1 million reported during the same period last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale, and, according to Saber Interactive exec Tim Willits, changed everything for the studio. Even Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from Space Marine 2, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">protagonist Titus is now leading the charge on the next narrative expansion of the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop said it was on the hunt for the next blockbuster Warhammer video game</a>, but CEO Kevin Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between. “We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games,” Rountree said at the time. “Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Games Workshop had warned that Donald Trump’s tariff plans could damage its profits by up to £12 million, but it seems the impact has yet to significantly dull financial performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s primary business is of course the sale of tabletop wargames and their miniatures, with an expansive bricks and mortar retail business providing a foundation for the hobby. In July, Games Workshop said that a “cute looking pipistrelle bat” was “delaying our work on our new temporary car park.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-the-warhammer-hobby-are-in-great-shape-but-the-company-has-two-problems-right-now-trumps-tariffs-and-a-cute-bat-that-is-delaying-work-on-a-new-car-park">Yes, really</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Uli Deck/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>One of the biggest unknowns about Valve's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">how much the cute little six-inch cube will cost</a>. Plenty of people have offered their thoughts about where the price may land, and now Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has shared what he says Valve told him during a recent meeting.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAN Show</a>, Linus said he has no idea what the Steam Machine price will be, but in speaking to Valve, he came away thinking the system won't be priced similarly to a new console.</p><p>"When I said, 'I'm disappointed that it isn't going to follow a console pricing model where it's subsidized by the fact that the manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product,' they kind of asked what I meant by, well, 'What do you mean by console price?' And I said, 'Well, $500,'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-steam-machine-price-to-follow-a-console-pricing-model-of-500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN.</a></p><p>"Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn't great."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is far from confirmation of anything, and predictions about how much the Steam Machine may cost are all over the place. One expert believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">$400 is the sweet spot</a> for the entry model, while others believe it could be more than $1,000. Others believe it may be priced similarly to the PS5.</p><p>"Tariffs, surging memory / storage costs, supply chain volatility and an inability to subsidize to the same extent as traditional console manufacturers are all working against Valve at the moment," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1991311485323063443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said</a>. "That being said, the specs suggest Valve wanted this to be in line with PS5 pricing."</p><p>Before this, Linus said Valve told him they could not confirm a price for the Steam Machine due in part to "rapidly evolving market conditions."</p><p>"They did give me one hint, though. They said that while they expect it to be very competitively priced with a PC, that it will be priced like a PC. Rather than like a console with games subsidizing the upfront hardware price," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">he said.</a></p><p>Officially, Valve has only said its goal is for the Steam Machine to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">"affordable" and priced according to the value it offers</a>. This is pretty much what every company says about their products, so these comments don't tell us much of anything.</p><p>The Steam Machine launches in 2026, but preorders are not yet open and the exact launch timing has not been confirmed as of yet. For now, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">everything we know about the Steam Machine.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160705/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In the great pantheon of shoot-'em-up games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/r-type">R-Type</a> is both one of the greatest and one of the most excruciatingly difficult. Released in arcades in 1987 and drawing visual inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger, you pilot an R-9 fighter craft through spectacular alien worlds in a bid to destroy the Bydo Empire.</p>
<p>Although shoot 'em ups later evolved to favour more twitch-reflex gameplay, R-Type’s staple is its strict memorisation, requiring you to learn it by rote. As with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gradius">Gradius</a>, not dying is an unspoken challenge: losing your power-ups makes recovery brutally tough, and the game's infamously aggressive checkpoints send you back a considerable distance each time you bite a bullet.</p>
<p>Impressed with the polygonal revision of Taito’s 1996 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/raystorm_x_raycrisis_hd_collection">Raystorm</a>, IREM endeavoured to make a similar transition for R-Type’s fourth entry. Being their first attempt at 3D, it was a project with a steep learning curve. And, while the result was glorious, it was also mystifyingly brief, remaining a PlayStation exclusive for 27 years.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160703/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> - a remaster that upscales the visuals handsomely. Its PlayStation-era polygons have been buffed to an astonishing shine without losing any of their characteristic charm, and overall visibility is greatly improved.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the game was originally in a 4:3 aspect ratio, some trickery has been done to create the illusion of widescreen, using an “expanded” fade effect on the border edges that, when locked in, you quickly forget are there. Its upscaling is on par with M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/g-darius_hd">G-Darius</a> port, and, coming from City Connection — a developer praised for their taste in re-releases but less so for their effort thereafter — its quality comes as a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta is one of the series' best, both smoother and cleaner than <strong>R-Type Final</strong>, and faster and freer than the three 2D entries that preceded it. Delta is to R-Type what G-Darius was to, well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a>: a remarkably slick, visually gorgeous game that maximises the possibilities of 3D architecture.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160700/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are now three craft available: the original R-9, playing in traditional fashion; the new R-X, with Force Ball homing properties; and the R-13, which is primarily hinged around its Force Ball’s sticky anchoring and laser tether. Impressively, each craft totally changes your approach, requiring its own roadmap to victory. Power-up modifiers vary greatly depending on the ship you’re using, making a maximum of nine shot-types when factoring in three per craft. Additionally, the doubling up of said power-ups expands the range even further.</p>
<p>Visually it’s beautiful and the audio is stellar. Set pieces abound as early as stage one: mecha-centipedes rip through burned-out industrial high-rises to encircle you in the foreground, and screen-dwarfing bosses pump out neon laser barrels and fiery exhaust flame. Dynamic and ploughed with invention, it cherry picks elements from its predecessors and paints them across a bolder seven-stage canvas.</p>
<p>Stage three is wonderfully creative, the entire episode just one hulking, stalking boss that requires travelling beneath its feet to strip its armoury, before climbing to its peak under a hail of missiles. The way the camera scales, shifting your flight path in various directions, heightens its cinematic nature. The fine visual and audio details are terrific, too, like the way the music switches to a muted, bassy throb the instant your ship dips below water.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160708/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Delta remains a hardcore memoriser, despite having more random elements than those before it. It also maintains checkpoints, although now getting powered back up post-death is much easier. Not dying, though, is still the star to shoot for, as maintaining a strong ship enables you to wipe out large enemies and bosses in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>More than anything else, though, Delta is about ball control. And by that, I mean the Force Ball: R-Type’s idiosyncratic ship attachment. More than any other game in the series, Force Ball usage feels so much more integral, and its strategy varies greatly depending on the different ship types.</p>
<p>Typically the ball can be bolted to the front or back of the craft with a touch. When positioned there, it provides different shot boosts depending on the colour of the power-up you collect. It also shields against almost all incoming bullets and missiles. With a touch of the button, it can be shot out directly into enemies or objects, and set to travel adjacently, firing as it goes to cover more screen space.</p>

<p>Sending the Force Ball out on repeat is how Delta ticks, with the landscape and enemy patterns calling for ever-evolving strategies. When it’s fired into a large enemy it can be absolutely devastating, its point-blank hit-rate making short work of any foe - but its greatest trick is in its new “Dose” function. Now, whenever the ball absorbs a bullet on your behalf, it fills a gauge that, when reaching 100%, will allow you to deploy an explosive super attack against everything on the screen.</p>
<p>Delta has been engineered painstakingly around this, cleverly placing swarms of popcorn enemies in-between junctures so you can quickly ‘dose up’ with a little risk-reward flying. Attached to the front of your craft, it can be used as a collision barrier, nosing through enemy waves and building the meter fast. Dedicated players will be able to eke out myriad possibilities for maximising the Dose attack's regular deployment.</p>
<p>Delta proves incredibly deep and impressively malleable for a series known for its strict rail structure. Elements that pose problems initially can be quickly outwitted through experimentation, and often felled in the blink of an eye. Learning not just where to camp, but how to utilise the Force Ball effectively increases your offence and defence in equal stride. And when all else fails, you still have your charge beam to cut through incoming obstacles.</p>

<p>Although you start with limited continues, these increase through play time, and once a stage is beaten it becomes available in practice. There are three difficulty levels to choose from, and perks in the form of graphics texture options, screen dimension adjustments, and time-unlockable bonuses that will keep you plugging away.</p>
<p>Delta HD Boosted's only real presentation shortcoming is that, inexplicably, you can’t skip the lengthy start-up sequence on each new game. With no quick restart from the pause menu either, you’re forced back to the title screen to repeatedly endure the whole opening preamble. It’s an easily addressable oversight that proves genuinely frustrating.</p>
<p>Delta is often cited as one of the most difficult R-Type games, but I beg to differ. Compared to the more static nature of its predecessors, all the new tricks and possibilities here actually make it easier in many ways. Getting powered back up after a death is far friendlier, the Dose super weapon is a crucial get-out-of-jail-free card, and being able to adjust the ship’s speed can save you in a pinch. That said, it’s still hard as nails, and 'Kid' difficulty, despite the disparaging name, comes highly recommended as a first port of call.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A true arcade game that never was, and confined to the PlayStation until now, shoot-'em-up fans will adore what’s in store. A seminal work that has never looked better, Delta, with its boundless creativity and exacting design, stands out not just amongst its peers, but as perhaps the best R-Type the series ever produced.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s still crazy tough, and no quick restarts or scene-skipping is painful, but this new HD revamp is by far the best way to play it. If you’re itching for a shoot-'em-up experience of note, this will make your year.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Another week, another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-Ultimate-is-everywhere/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud gaming service</a>. This week, eight games are entering the service, while an additional title is added to the list of games playable with the RTX 5080-powered Blackwell servers. Also, those servers are just one region away from completing NVIDIA's campaign to make them available worldwide.</p>



<p>Regarding the games joining the service this week, the heavy-hitters are titles like the highly anticipated Persona-like indie game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the early access release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-pubg-productions/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, the new survival game from PUBG Productions that's finally releasing in early access. It's a different kind of class of heavy-hitters <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/">compared to last week's batch of games,</a> but they're heavy hitters nonetheless.</p>



<p>As far as the game that's now RTX 5080-ready, it's Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. A game that definitely didn't get off to a great start with players, but has since been updated for a much smoother experience that doesn't involve a bunch of frustrating insta-fail stealth missions. At least it was always a good looking game, and now that you can play it through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, it can look even better.</p>



<p>Speaking of those Blackwell servers, last week it was Phoenix getting added to the list of regions where RTX 5080 servers were available. The only remaining region on NVIDIA's list now is Stockholm, which isn't ready to go live this week, but will be ready soon. As a reminder, the Blackwell servers are only available to players subscribed to GeForce NOW at the Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>"<em>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere</em>," head of partnerships and licensing at 2K, Sean Haran, added with regard to GeForce NOW in a press release. "<em>Anyone can experience the glory of Borderlands 4, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you're at home or on the move.</em>"</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spongebob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide</li>



<li>Long Drive North</li>



<li>Demonschool</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</li>



<li>Prologue: Go Wayback!</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>



<li>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Sacred 2 Remaster</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Open world Czech Bohemia-inspired orienteering game Prologue: Go Wayback! from PlayerUnknown Productions and PUBG creator Brendan Greene is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">out now in Steam Early Access</a> - and that's very inconvenient, because we <em>still</em> don't have consensus on a nickname. Back in 2017, RPS jocularly renamed PUBG "Plunkbat" - a show of feistiness that surely resulted in no angry emails (genuinely, I don't know if it did), and which I recently consecrated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">writing it on the wall</a> of a random shed in Scotland. We are still massaging our temples about the new game, however. 
</p>
<p>Obviously we can't just call it Prologue: Go Wayback! That exclamation mark is some drive-by Yu-Gi-Oh bullshit, and besides, the title's arguably a tautology and I would like to be able to mention this game to my partner without sounding like I think she doesn't know what "prologue" means. So here's our working list of alternatives, mixing in a few other informal RPS titling conventions. Please pick favourites or suggest your own in the comments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Proback</li>
<li>Prologoback</li>
<li>Prayback</li>
<li>Progo</li>
<li>Ploway</li>
<li>Proooack</li>
<li>Puwack</li>
<li>ack!</li>
<li>Pooo!</li>
<li>Prolo!</li>
<li>Plab!</li>
<li>: !</li>
<li>Prologue Colon Go Wayback!</li>
<li>Pro Colon!</li>
<li>Colon!</li>
<li>Colon Go!</li>
<li>Colon Go Way!</li>
<li>GoW</li>
<li>Anti-Social Peak</li>
<li>A Good Walk Rewardingly Ruined</li>
<li>Gunshy Plunkbat</li>
<li>Revengeless Liam Neeson Simulator</li>
<li>Czech Stranding</li>
<li>Not Generated From Anything Stolen</li>
</ul>
<p>The last part is a reference to the game's map generation tools. As disclosed on Steam, the game makes use of proprietary machine learning software to create wilderness maps. Here's that disclosure in full. 
</p>
<blockquote>We are developing our own in-house machine-learning model which is trained on publicly available open-source data and vetted to prevent the use of any copyrighted material. This ML model is used to generate base terrain maps in Unreal Engine 5 which are then populated procedurally with custom assets such as the trees, rivers, rocks, and hills you explore. Our artists and designers use our ML model to allow us to generate 64km2 maps that look and feel natural and realistic. The game generates a new map offline on your system every time you play. 
</blockquote>
<p>It's one of the more informative such disclosures, responding to the broad concern about genAI using other people's art and media for their datasets without the creator's consent. It muddies the waters a bit, however: "machine learning" and "generative AI" aren't the same thing, as Embark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">explained to us</a> in an interview about robot animations in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. 
</p><p>The disclosure also doesn't address worries about the emissions cost of 'training' generators by having them repeatedly go over datasets to extrapolate patterns - yes, it'll run offline on your PC, which suggests a lower energy footprint for the user, but it's not clear how much power was consumed during development. There's also the question of whether the map generation here contributes to overall normalisation of efforts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">to automate jobs and shrink team sizes</a>, even if the game's handling of such <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">technological terrors</a> strikes you as above reproach.
</p><p>
Such caveat! Much proviso! More context than I can easily get into here! And it's only going to get more complicated. As the developers recap on Steam, this is "the first of three games that lay the foundation for our studio's ultimate vision: Project Artemis", which is "a platform for massive, living multiplayer sandboxes where millions of players can shape their own worlds and emergent stories."
</p><p>Somewhere inside all of these metaversal convolutions and investor-facing language there is a promising wilderness walking sim. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">interviewed Greene</a> and played the game earlier in the year (amongst other things, he told me there are in-game lore reasons for the title). I swam across a river in the dark and it did feel slightly magical.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-marshall-acton-iii-bluetooth-speaker-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-them-out-on-black-fridays-opening-day-2000645713</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-marshall-acton-iii-bluetooth-speaker-drops-40-off-amazon-clears-them-out-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-opening-day.1359196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bluetooth speaker market overflows with generic black boxes that all sound roughly the same, but <strong>Marshall brings legitimate audio heritage and iconic design</strong> to an over-crowded category. The <em>Acton III</em> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/">dropped to a record low of $179 for Black Friday’s opening day on Amazon, down from its usual $299 price</a>. Marshall built its reputation on guitar amplifiers that shaped rock and roll for decades, and that audio expertise translates directly into home speakers that sound like music instead of compressed digital mush.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Small Speakers Sound Big</h2>
<p>The Acton III delivers a <strong>wider stereo soundstage compared to the previous generations</strong>, hence giving the impression of sound surpassing the physical speaker cabinet. To achieve better stereo separation in such a compact form factor, Marshall redesigned the internal driver arrangement and acoustic tuning. The signature Marshall sound <strong>emphasizes midrange clarity and controlled bass</strong> which makes vocals and instruments sound present rather than distant. You get to hear details in recordings that cheaper speakers bury under the boomy bass or shrill treble.</p>



<p>Marshall engineered the Acton III to be immediately usable without complicated setup procedures or compulsory app installations. You power on the speaker, toggle on Bluetooth on your phone, select Marshall Acton III from available devices and <strong>start playing music within 30 seconds</strong>. This straightforward approach saves you from frustration over pairing modes, connection failures, or multi-step configuration processes. This speaker remembers your previously paired device and picks up the signal automatically when it comes in range.</p>
<p>Next-generation <strong>Bluetooth 5.2 provides more stable connections with lower latency</strong> than older Bluetooth versions. The improved protocol keeps connections strong even when you walk into other rooms with your phone and reduces audio lag during video playback. Marshall future-proofed the speaker by building in support for Bluetooth features that haven’t been finalized yet, so firmware updates can enable new capabilities as the Bluetooth standard evolves.</p>



<p>The<strong> 3.5mm auxiliary input will accept wired connections</strong> from devices that don’t have Bluetooth or for situations where you want to avoid wireless compression. You can plug in older MP3 players, laptops without Bluetooth, or use the aux input for guaranteed zero-latency audio during gaming or video editing. For purists who prefer wired, analog input bypasses digital processing.</p>
<p>The <strong>top analog control knobs adjust the volume, bass, and treble</strong> with very satisfying tactile feedback-beating tapping on glass touchscreens any day. Boosting the bass for hip-hop or dialing it back down for acoustic is straightforward; you can easily dial in your preferred sound signature. The treble control brightens up vocals and cymbals or tames overly harsh recordings.</p>
<p>At $179, this Black Friday price makes the Marshall Acton III cheaper than many generic Bluetooth speakers that don’t feature the audio engineering, build quality, and design heritage that Marshall has. That 40% discount brings premium audio down to mid-tier pricing, and that wider soundstage combined with Marshall’s signature tuning delivers an experience that justifies the brand’s reputation.</p>

              <p data-start="90" data-end="688">Searching for a holiday gift that fits the lifestyle of the fitness lover in your life? Whether your partner prefers long runs, scaling indoor climbing walls, or sticking to a steady gym routine, the right present can show how much you pay attention to what they care about. Right now, thanks to an early Black Friday promotion, you can snag the Google Pixel Watch 4 at a solid discount. The 41mm model usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket.</a></p>
<p data-start="690" data-end="924">The Pixel Watch 4 has a clean, polished look while maintaining the practicality people expect from an everyday wearable. You can pick between two display sizes, 41mm or a slightly larger 45mm, depending on preference or wrist size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="926" data-end="1470">The Google smartwatch can act as a personal fitness coach. It can suggest running workouts tailored to your goals, your training history, and how prepared your body is on a given day. Those personalized plans can help runners watch their progress unfold mile after mile, as longer routes and quicker splits start to feel more manageable. You can even design your own workouts, complete with warmups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Saved runs can be revisited anytime so you can track improvements and chase new personal bests.</p>
<p data-start="1472" data-end="1708">Beyond workouts, the watch provides a wide range of useful health metrics, including daily readiness scores, cardio load stats, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which gives you a quick snapshot of your recovery and helps you shape the day ahead.</p>
<p data-start="1710" data-end="1995">With the Pixel Watch 4, you can use offline Google Maps, pay on the go with Google Wallet, and connect it with other Pixel products or smart home gear such as a Google Nest hub with ease.</p>


<h2>Upgrades With the Pixel Watch 4</h2>
<p>The main upgrades we’re seeing on this newest model over the Google Pixel Watch 3 are subtle. First, while it’s hard to tell in the pictures along, the watch now features a curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 had curved glass as well, the actual screen underneath the Watch 4 is also curved, standing out visually.</p>
<p>You can also expect better battery life with this new model getting you up to 30 hours as a standard when using the always-on display or up to 48 hours when in Batter Saver mode.</p>
<p>And to no one’s surprise, Google is now touting AI features on the Pixel Watch 4 with direct access to Gemini.</p>

<p>There have been rumors for weeks that the Silent Hill 2 Remake was coming to the Xbox. The biggest hint yet is that an Xbox Achievements list for Silent Hill 2 is now live, meaning the official unveiling is scarily close.</p>



<p>A year after its release, Silent Hill 2’s remake got a second lease of life when it arrived free on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Plus</a>. We then saw a big leak that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake was coming to Xbox</a>. Fast forward a bit of time, and before you know it, there’s now a full Silent Hill 2 Remake achievements list to view.</p>







<h2 id="h-silent-hill-2-remake-announcement-coming">Silent Hill 2 Remake Announcement Coming</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Silent-Hill-2/achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TrueAchievements</a>, the Silent Hill 2 Xbox Achievements list is up!</p>



<p>PlayStation fans will recognize the list, as it’s the same on Xbox as it is on the PS5. There are no extra achievements, so it’s just the same tricky tasks to complete.</p>

Now, Prologue: Go Wayback! is officially entering early access today and giving players a chance to brave the elements from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLdm77g5F2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLdm77g5F2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prologue unfolds from a first-person perspective and drops players into a landscape that changes in every playthrough thanks to procedurally-generated maps. Even the weather can dramatically change, which forces you to make choices about how you're going to survive. Thirst, hunger, and body temperature all need to be maintained long enough for you to reach a weather tower. There are always multiple approaches for that goal, and plenty of ways to die if you make the wrong move.</p><p>As part of the launch, PlayerUnknown Productions is introducing a handful of features. Players will be able to customize the weather, the temperature, and the time of day at the beginning of each playthrough, which can make the experience easier or harder.</p><p>The standard mode is called Go Wayback!, but there's an even more difficult option called Objective: Survive. In the latter, you'll have limited resources to fall back on. Users who just want to explore can try the Free Roam mode, which lets up on the survival aspect of the game. But you can still manage to die if you fall from a great height.</p><p>One of the most intriguing new features is the map editor, which will let you import an image into the in-game map and use it to create a customized world. Alternatively, you can design your own maps.</p><p>Future early-access updates are planned that will introduce more dynamic weather patterns, the ability to craft objects with the available materials, climbing gear, and items of clothing that can degrade or tear if players don't repair them.</p><p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is now available for $20 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-0261c6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios has made a key change to Battlefield 6's Conquest mode which the developer <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991482335527657827" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">says</a> should help matches run longer, but in a good way.</p><p>As of today, November 20, Conquest matches now have an increased number of tickets--up from 1,000 to 1,200. The developer said it arrived at this change after watching feedback generally, along with "win rates, balance, the impact of objective play, and more."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">1.1.2.0 update</a> made changes to help push players to play the objective, and this has been working out so far, with more come-from-behind victories, among other positive results. However, these changes also led to matches ending "sooner than intended," and to address this, Battlefield Studios is increasing the number of tickets. The developer said this should help with match length and retain the focus on playing the objective.</p><p>"We believe that focusing on objective play is deep in the DNA of Battlefield and now more than ever, playing the objective and working with your squad and being a cohesive team overall will secure your team the victory," the developer explained.</p><p>The 1.1.2.0 update for Battlefield 6 also made a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">major change to aim-assist</a>, reverting the system to be what it was during the open beta.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rocketwerkz.com/">Rocketwerkz</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> CEO Dean Hall and Floating Point Origin Interactive founder Felipe Falanghe sound downright giddy when they talk about the new C# framework named "Brutal." During a recent call with Game Developer, the brains behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DayZ</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> couldn't stop making random asides to each other about what they've pulled off with the tool and how they've inspired each other's work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their joy was infectious because once you understand how Brutal functions, you realize every new feature is a bona fide accomplishment even for this pair of seasoned developers. "It's called Brutal for a reason," Hall said after Felipe compared working with it to the experience of sitting on a bar stool while all your friends using engines like Godot are sitting on a comfy couch.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brutal is, to quote a Rocketwerkz spokesperson, a tool that "uses the latest .NET features while providing low-level API access to high-performance C++ libraries and tools, including a Vulkan graphics API." That's it. That's all you get.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocketwerkz created the framework to develop </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a spiritual successor to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The company invited Falanghe onto a steering committee consulting on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has led to him consulting him on the engine. Brutal will be made open source through a commercial entity called "Ahwoo."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-unveils-new-toolkit-to-accelerate-multi-platform-launches" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity unveils new toolkit to accelerate multi-platform launches</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers who remember the days of XNA and home-brewed engines may shudder at the prospect. Visual scripting tools like Unity and Unreal Engine were supposed to speed up development and let designers think more about their game and less about blocks of code. Why would we go back to a world where everyone's building their own game engines?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall understands that nervousness. But in our conversation he made a rather bold prediction: frameworks like Brutal, not game engines, will be the future of the game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Brutal forces developers to build workflows from the ground up">Brutal forces developers to build workflows from the ground up</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To follow Hall's thinking, you need to think about Brutal in terms of developer workflows, not what it can or can't do compared to third-party game engines.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocketwerkz created Brutal to drive development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but that's because they determined scene-based rendering wasn't sufficient for the task. "If you take Unity or Unreal, you have this editor scene and push play, it becomes a game scene and everything in it is relative to 0-0-0 of that scene," said Hall. "That's how you draw things, and it's so ingrained that people have a hard time imagining something that's different."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/obituary-interplay-co-founder-rebecca-ann-heineman-has-passed-away-at-62" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Interplay co-founder Rebecca Heineman has passed away at 62</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, everything's contextual. So an object is drawn relative to something else. The camera is actually always at it's 0-0, it never moves, and everything is drawn into it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Spaceflight simulators depict long distances, a concept in rendering sometimes called "floating origin." Falanghe said he was rethinking his approach to this in his new project and came up with a similar solution to Rocketwerkz, calling it "first-order floating origin," where the system resolves the positions of objects to be relative to the camera as late as possible before rendering. "You still get the basically the same functionality, but you get to use high precision numbers as far as you can into the game execution," he explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In our case, we resolve them on the GPU. We send a pair of of numbers that act like a double precision value to the shaders, and the shaders then figure out the camera relative coordinates." To do anything similar in Unity (the tool Falanghe used to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kerbal Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), you have to "brute force" the existing system by telling it to shift every object in the game world by the same amount.</span></p><p>Image via Rocketwerkz</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers wondering about optimization performance in Brutal—Rocketwerkz explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> C# code runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and is JIT-compiled when the game runs instead of being compiled native ahead of time. This was done in part to make the game "easier to mod," since the managed code is "more accessible" to players.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/spooky-mmorpg-networking-stories-from-guild-wars-and-guild-wars-2-gdc-podcast-ep-56" target="_self" data-discover="true">Spooky MMORPG networking stories from Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 - GDC Podcast Ep. 56</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pay attention to the process though. The thinking wasn't "Unity can't do this, I need a tool that can do this." It was "our game needs floating origin to work this way, how do we do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a mindset that comes naturally to Falanghe, Hall said. "One of [Falanghe]'s superpowers that I don't think he quite realizes he has is he's always thinking about how he wants to do something, especially if it's not something that he's super familiar with."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a second call, Hall showed us other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> systems built through Brutal. Some, including one that used volumetric lighting to create engine glow went a bit over my head, but Hall's system for mathematical-based user interface features was easy to understand.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> lets players simulate space flight with a number of semi-realistic UI elements that can be expanded or shrunk and even moved to other monitors. Video game UI is usually texture-based, but Hall wanted these to be math-based to allow for that scaling and repositioning. He also feels these look crisper and less "washed-out."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are among a number of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Agency</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> systems that are technically possible in other game engines, but by building them from the ground up, developers can answer the question "what am I trying to do?" before they ask "how am I trying to do it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall and Falanghe said this was made possible by a very coincidental series of events that happened alongside the making of Brutal: the advancement and popularization of large language models in generative AI.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Brutal workflows are the opposite of vibe-coding">Brutal workflows are the opposite of vibe-coding</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like a cult member," Hall said sheepishly, when describing how he uses ChatGPT while working in Brutal. But he and Falanghe agreed—using LLMs has made language-based coding an easier task.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>that</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> much easier, to be clear. They both said that when querying an LLM, they rarely copy and paste whatever code it generates. Instead they ask questions about C# libraries or Vulkan documentation, and the software is able to return high-quality answers. Answers that normally require programmers to sit down for hours to pore over documentation or scour ancient forums to find that one post with the solution (which was &nbsp;probably written in 2014).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"An LLM is essentially tokenizing language, then putting masses of vectors around that to build linkages between those tokens," said Hall. "What could be better than a highly-structured, in fact </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>brutally</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> structured language?" Vulkan and the latest version of C# are very "highly structured, with very clear syntax."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers critical of ChatGPT maker OpenAI should be able to replicate this process on open source models like DeepSeek, Falanghe said (though he hasn't tried this himself).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This process doesn't work as well with Unity and Unreal because they're both "highly spatial" as a result of their visual scripting tools. A solution for one game's problem may not work with another because of the different scripted elements. LLMs scouring the web can't produce consistent answers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is also the opposite of vibe coding, a method where programmers tell an LLM what they want a system to do and it generates code—and it isn't code completion, where AI tools "predict" what someone is typing and finish the string for them to speed up their workflow. The only thing the LLM does for Brutal developers is speed up access to information, letting them research without watching a 40 minute YouTube video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Falanghe said he even tried "vibe coding" at one point with ChatGPT but found it inadequate. He compared the experience to being "a project manager who's not a coder" and badly communicating with a programmer about how to make an application. They'll give you something that's almost correct, but not quite what you wanted, and you'll just go back and forth iterating and making it worse and worse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You don't need to pay somebody to have that experience, you can just do it with an AI and be frustrated," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How can frameworks change game development?">How can frameworks change game development?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can boil down Hall's theory about what he calls "the death of big engines" to this: if LLMs make language-based coding more accessible, than visual-based scripting loses its edge. Developers who embrace the Brutal method become responsible for understanding every piece of tech powering their game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a difficult task, but one that doesn't require them to understand the parts of their tools that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>don't</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> go into their game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And despite the difficulty of using the framework, Hall said Rocketwerkz has had an easier time recruiting programmers using this tool than they did using Unreal. High-level Unreal programming requires highly specialized knowledge tuned not just for the engine, but the kinds of games being made. A programmer already familiar with C# can pick up the Brutal workflow if they're willing to embrace its... well, brutality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall brushed off the notion that Brutal would be the sole framework driving an end-to-game engines. He even grew a tad prickly at the notion that some companies might establish themselves as Brutal experts who can build tools for other developers on top of the framework, akin to developers making plugins for Unity and Unreal. &nbsp;"Brutal was made to deliver a very specific, kind of hard-to-make game where you need to sit down and ask a whole bunch of questions [about how it works]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't like the idea that Brutal would then become this one-size-fits-all pocket knife because I don't think that's true. In my heart of hearts, I think someone else might create something else that follows a similar approach, but simpler."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall's vision of the future game industry is almost the polar opposite of the one pitched by UGC platforms and AI boosters. Instead of a world where game development becomes easier through simplified tools, it becomes more accessible through easier understanding of language-based programming through LLMs.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Skeptics could brush this off by saying language-based coding could never move as fast as engine-based game development. If that were true, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kitten Space Program</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> alpha would have taken years to produce, right?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hall addressed this point while flying through his team's simulated solar system, careening through the canyons of Mars quickly after directing a craft to initiate a landing on the detailed surface of Earth's moon. "We made all of this in about a year," he said.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>What did I just watch..?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has seemingly become the go-to place for crossovers, with everyone from Solid Snake to Mariah Carey making an appearance in the online game.</p>
<p>Its latest trailer teases the Chapter 6 Finale Event, and it's an unsettling realisation of its crossover ambitions, showcasing Godzilla, King Kong, Homer Simpson, and Kill Bill's 'The Bride'. Oh, and some Star Wars X-Wings, too. We can't help but feel a keen sense of bemusement watching the action unfold – yes, crossovers in Fortnite is hardly a new concept, but it's just all so <em>weird</em>, y'know..?</p>

<p>Kill Bill is especially jarring. Of course, the upcoming release of <strong>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</strong> – which combines both movies into one seamless experience – makes it obvious why The Bride has cropped up in Fortnite, with the game playing host to a 'The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge', but even so... Knowing the context of why the character embarks upon her revenge mission in the movies makes it all the more weirder seeing her fight alongside Homer flippin' Simpson.</p>
<p>It's not a movie for kids, y'know?</p>
<p>We're looking into this too much, we get that, but where does it end..? Are we going to see Art the Clown prancing alongside Ms. Rachel? Y'know what, don't get any ideas, Epic.</p>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, exactly one year after its initial release on PC and Xbox Series S|X, following the end of the timed console exclusivity deal with Microsoft.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-anniversary-ps5-debut-qa-ps5-pro-leans-toward-pc-high-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> an interview with GSC Game World focused on the PS5 launch, but we also asked about the content and features that are still to come. Ahead of last year's launch, the Ukrainian studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that the game would eventually be updated with features like multiplayer, cross-platform mods, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. However, twelve months later, there is still no news to share on that front. However, we did get confirmation that the first STALKER 2 DLC will launch at some point in 2026. As a reminder, the game's Ultimate Edition is still being sold with the promise that its Season Pass would include 'two future expansions and all upcoming DLCs'.</p>



<p>We also inquired about the announced upgrade to a newer version of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. </p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> Switching to a new version of Unreal Engine 5 is a very big task, which is exactly why even in our roadmap we especially noted that we cannot guarantee the exact timing. It should bring a significant boost to optimization overall, but we will keep you updated on the timing of this update through our socials. But here I would like to note that <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-update-1-7-adds-faction-turf-wars-expedition-mode-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.7</a> has already delivered a significant and very noticeable optimization gain, and it is available right now.</em></p>



<p>Finally, we wanted to know if GSC Game World was satisfied with the performance of STALKER 2 so far.</p>



<p><em><strong>Zakhar Bocharov:</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One million copies sold in under three days</a>&nbsp;and several million players through Game Pass on PC and Xbox can undoubtedly be considered successful figures. Over the year, the game received 7 major updates — and far more smaller ones — which not only improved performance but also added new content. The game is now significantly different from what it was at launch. Updates are a complex matter. In the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., they could probably go on forever, much like the pursuit of perfection. Nevertheless, they will continue forward on.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option-2000645709</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate%E2%80%99s-external-hard-drive-drops-to-a-new-record-low-amazon-clears-out-the-4tb-option.1359130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kicked off Black Friday by dropping the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/">Seagate 4TB external hard drive to a record low of $99, down from its usual $124 price</a>. External storage solves the constant problem of running out of space on laptops, game consoles and desktops without requiring you to open up your machine. This 4TB capacity gives you enough room to store your entire game library, backup your computer multiple times, or archive years of photos and videos. The drive’s<strong> universal compatibility with Windows, Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation</strong> means you buy it once and use it everywhere without reformatting or compatibility headaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plug-and-Play Simplicity</h2>
<p>The Seagate 4TB HDD <strong>doesn’t need any software installation or setup process</strong> to get it up and running. You connect the provided 18-inch-long USB 3.0 cable between the drive and your computer, and the OS immediately recognizes it as available storage. Windows users will see the drive pop up in File Explorer; Mac users will find it in Finder; and console gamers can format it via their system settings in roughly 30 seconds. This is true <strong>plug-and-play functionality</strong> with no troublesome proprietary software, driver downloads, or cumbersome setup wizards.</p>



<p>In theory, the USB 3.0 interface can reach transfer speeds of as high as 5Gbps but realistically, <strong>this works out to 100-120MB/s for sequential file transfers</strong>. You can back up your entire photo library in the time it takes to make coffee or transfer 4K video footage without waiting around all afternoon. You will be able to copy a 50GB game in about 7-8 minutes. This speed is more than adequate for directly playing games from the drive on either an Xbox or a PlayStation, though load times will be slower compared to internal SSDs.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact design measures approximately 4.5 inches long by 3 inches wide</strong> and less than an inch thick, so it easily slips into a laptop bag or backpack. Weighing only a few ounces, you hardly know the drive is in the bag when on the move. Finished in matte black to resist fingerprints, it looks professional when plugged into your laptop for home or office use. The rounded edges and smooth surfaces keep the drive from catching on contents inside a bag or scratching other devices. Seagate has engineered the enclosure to shield the internal drive against minor drops and bumps common during normal travel.</p>



<p>The 4TB of capacity offers enough space for <strong>around 1,000 hours of HD video, 80,000 high-resolution photos, or around 50 of the latest AAA games</strong>. Xbox and PlayStation users are able to install their entire game collections and not have to continuously uninstall titles to make room for new releases. Archive completed projects, store raw footage, or maintain multiple backup versions of important files without running out of space on the drive.</p>
<p>In addition, Seagate bundles the drive with one year of <em>Rescue Service</em> which will help you get your data back in case the drive dies or you accidentally delete some important files. That service alone can save you thousands of dollars compared to paying for professional data recovery out of pocket. With decades of experience in the storage business, the company’s drives power everything from consumer devices to enterprise data centers.</p>
<p>At $99, this <strong>Seagate external hard drive costs just 2.4 cents per gigabyte</strong>, which is exceptionally good value for reliable branded storage. Amazon’s Black Friday pricing brings the cost down to where buying cloud storage subscriptions for the same capacity would cost more over two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone-2000645672</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-ace-anc-headphones-are-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-amazon-clears-out-stock-and-wants-them-all-gone.1359127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s stock counter shows<strong> fewer than 12 units remaining at the time of writing this article</strong> which tells you everything about how fast the Sonos Ace headphones are moving at this Black Friday price. Premium wireless headphones solve the problem of airplane noise, open office chaos and commute soundtrack quality but most flagship models cost a fortune. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Sonos Ace just dropped to its lowest price ever at $279 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from the usual $399</a>, which puts them at roughly half the cost of AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Music</h2>
<p>The <strong>Sonos Ace delivers spatial audio via Dolby Atmos</strong> which places instruments and vocals in a three-dimensional soundstage around your head. Dynamic head tracking shifts the audio positioning as you move, so the sound stays anchored to your device rather than rotating with your head. This tech creates an immersive listen that’s almost as if you’re sitting in a recording studio or a concert hall. It works great in those Atmos-mixed tracks on Apple Music or Tidal, where producers have placed elements on purpose in the spatial field.</p>



<p>It’s unusual that Sonos allows for <strong>lossless audio streaming over Bluetooth</strong>; most wireless headphones tend to compress audio to fit within Bluetooth’s bandwidth limitations. The company also uses USB-C connectivity for true lossless playback when you want absolute audio fidelity. This dual approach means you get convenience when you need it and maximum quality when you’re sitting down for critical listening.</p>
<p>The <strong>ANC uses multiple microphones to analyze and neutralize external sounds</strong> across a wide frequency range. Sonos engineered the ANC to handle everything from low-frequency airplane engine drone to mid-range conversation noise. It also adjusts in real time to your surroundings, kicking cancellation harder or softer depending on the ambient noise. Transparency mode lets you hear your surroundings when needed, be it airport announcements or quick conversations.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches 30 hours with ANC enabled</strong> which means you can fly cross-country multiple times before needing a charge. That endurance puts the Ace ahead of most competitors that struggle to hit 20 hours with noise cancellation running. The rapid charging feature gives you three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in, saving you when you forgot to charge overnight. <strong>A full charge takes about three hours via USB-C</strong>&nbsp;and the headphones support charging while listening through the cable.</p>
<p>The physical design focuses on all-day comfort: <strong>plush memory foam ear cushions are wrapped in soft vegan leather</strong>. Sonos shaped the headband and earcups to adapt to various head shapes, hairstyles, and even accessories such as glasses without causing pressure points. An adjustable headband extends smoothly to find that just-right fit, while earcups rotate to keep up with the angle of your head.</p>
<p>At $279, the Sonos Ace costs roughly half what you’d pay for AirPods Max or Bose Ultra headphones and delivers comparable or superior features in several areas. The fact that Amazon has fewer than 12 units left at this record low price suggests other people have already figured out this value equation.</p>

<p>Leaks continue to flood in for Chapter 7 in Fortnite following a creator preview event held by Epic Games, including some of the items set to be included in the Season 1 Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite draws to a close next week with a big <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-zero-hour-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Hour live event</a>, and, following a period of downtime, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 7 kicks off on November 30</a>—and there’s a big collab in store, according to leaks.</p>







<h2 id="h-leaks-say-marty-mcfly-skin-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7">Leaks Say Marty McFly Skin Coming to Fortnite Chapter 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Zooming onto the scene. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to reliable leakers, including <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991464160996344068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, Marty McFly from the Back to the Future franchise will feature in the Battle Pass for Chapter 7, Season 1, alongside another big collab that Epic Games has already teased.</p>



<p>McFly’s look will be based on the original Back to the Future films, with high-top trainers, sunglasses, and an orange gilet, and his inclusion comes alongside previous links that indicated the iconic DeLorean car will be featured—with the vehicle already appearing in Epic Games’ Rocket League.</p>



<p>Ahead of the new chapter, Epic Games revealed a collab with Kill Bill, with The Bride shown in a trailer for the upcoming live event, and it’s stated that the iconic look, with the yellow tracksuit, will also feature in the Battle Pass.</p>







<p>The two collabs indicate the widespread rumor that Hollywood serves as major inspiration for the Island in Chapter 7, with a ‘Battlewood’ sign on the hills mimicking the famous Hollywood sign <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1991240664986632626" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">already spotted</a>.</p>



<p>This also aligns with previous leaks for Chapter 7, which indicate that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> will have collabs during the Chapter.</p>

<p>Embark Studios is well aware that ARC Raiders is a success. This is why the developer keeps supporting the game with new updates and dropping patch notes like it’s hot. The November 20 ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update drops some big changes that you can’t DUCK.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is amazing, but it isn’t perfect. This is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios nerfed ARC Raiders’ most OP perk</a> not long ago. The changes will keep coming, and improvements will shape ARC into <em>the </em>extraction shooter.</p>







<p>We’ve got everything you need to know about the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, featuring full patch notes at the end.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-arc-raiders-november-20-changes">Biggest ARC Raiders November 20 Changes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Look out. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Various balance changes have rolled out for the value of certain items, specific damage numbers—such as the Venator—have been readjusted, many bugs have been fixed, and there’s even a nice touch for rubber duck fans.</strong></p>



<p>You will need to think twice when selling certain items in ARC Raiders—such as Power Cells and certain ammo—as Embark has rung the changes. ARCs have been weakened to behave slightly more reasonably, and the Venator’s fire rate has been reworked, as it was “over-performing.”</p>







<p>One of the biggest, growing pastimes in ARC Raiders is collecting rubber ducks. While Embark hasn’t stated specifically what the change is, the dev has been listening to your request:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Your Raider Den has been ducked out.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-all-arc-raiders-patch-notes-for-november-20-update-1-3-0">All ARC Raiders Patch Notes For November 20 Update 1.3.0</h2>



<p>Here’s the complete 1.3.0 patch notes for you to read.</p>



<h3>Balance Changes</h3>



<h3>Items:</h3>



<h4>Deadline</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value: From 8,100 to 15,000 Coins</li>



<li>Sell value: From 3,000 to 5,000 Coins</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 2 Explosive compound + 1 Synthesized fuel</li>



<li>New: 3 Explosive compound + 2 ARC Circuitry&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Deadline trader stock: From 3 to 1</li>
</ul>



<h4>Power cell</h4>



<ul>
<li>Sell value: From 640 to 270 Coins</li>
</ul>



<h4>Launcher ammo</h4>



<ul>
<li>Buy value:
<ul>
<li>Old: 10 launcher ammo for 6,000 Coins</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 4,500 Coins</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Sell value: From 200 to 250</li>



<li>Crafting:
<ul>
<li>Old: 6 launcher ammo for 4 Metal parts + 1 Explosive Compound</li>



<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 1 ARC Motion Core + 2 Crude Explosives</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Venator</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:&nbsp;</strong>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.</li>



<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.</li>
</ul>



<h4>Explosive Damage</h4>



<p><strong>Dev note:</strong>&nbsp;We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</p>



<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.</li>



<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.</li>



<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<h3>Content and Bug Fixes</h3>



<h3>ARC</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.</li>



<li>Shredder
<ul>
<li>Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.</li>

<li>Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Maps&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.</li>



<li><strong>The Dam Battlegrounds</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Spaceport</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Blue Gate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Stella Montis</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.</li>



<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.</li>



<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.</li>



<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using Raider Voice (proximity chat) on PCs without AVX2 support.</li>



<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when surrendering after reconnecting to a session.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where scavenging parts from the Shredder could leave behind invisible collisions.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the Trials weekly rollover could display an outdated rank; the celebration now reflects the correct current rank and the UI remains accurate during the cooldown period.</li>



<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.</li>



<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Movement&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Improved enemy ground detection to better handle steep surfaces, reducing erratic movement when traversing angled terrain.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Weapons&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Aphelion
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Aphelion tracers could become excessively bright at distance, reducing visibility for the player being shot at.</li>



<li>Increased Aphelion blueprint drop rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>

            <p>Capcom has celebrated a new milestone for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, which came out last year, but the most common response so far is - what about some DLC?</p>
<p>Last night, the Dragon's Dogma 2 team shared the following post across its social media: "Thank you to the four million Arisen around the world! We're grateful to share the immersive fantasy world of Dragon's Dogma 2 with you all, where freedom and adventure await."</p>

<p>Capcom accompanied its post with some Dragon's Dogma 2 artwork proclaiming this player number (see image below), and it is of course a figure worth celebrating. However, fans of the game clearly now want more of the good stuff, and have used this post to voice their desires for some DLC.</p>
<p>"Where's the post release support guys? DLC? A reason to revisit? Feels like you have given up on it," reads one such response. "Please give us any information on if any plans for updates or DLC are in the works. We all are dying to know," adds another. You get the idea.</p><p>And after all, the first game in the series got new content after launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-dark-arisen-review">via expansion Dark Arisen</a>, which dramatically transformed the game. I was just chatting with our Alex about it, and in his words Dark Arisen "legitimately took the game from like a 7 to a 9/10".</p>

<p>However, there is one key spanner in the works when it comes to new content for Dragon's Dogma 2. The game's director - Hideaki Itsuno - is no longer part of the development team. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/veteran-capcom-developer-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom-after-30-years-and-five-months">Itsuno left Capcom after more than 30 years at the studio</a> in August of last year. At this time, he said he hoped to "create fun, beautiful games that are as memorable as, or even more memorable than, the ones I have created so far".</p>
<p>In November last year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-director-hideaki-itsuno-announces-new-studio-focused-on-original-aaa-action-games">Itsuno was now the head of LightSpeed Japan Studio</a>, a newly-established game developer with a focus on the creation of "original AAA action game titles".</p>
<p>Do you want to see more Dragon's Dogma 2 content? Or, have you accepted it is what it is?</p>
