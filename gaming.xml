Booo!</p>
<p>However, there's a silver lining — it's also getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Switch 2 Version</a>. The catch is that Switch 2 version is a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> release. <em>Sigh</em>.</p>
<p>Confirmed for a Western release back in March 2025, Trails Beyond the Horizon is the 13th entry in the long-running series that started back with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">Trails in the Sky</a> in 2004 — which, coincidentally, is getting a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter">remake in September</a>, published by GungHo.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The Game-Key Card part <em>is</em> disappointing, but we're looking forward to seeing how the game looks and runs on the newer console, at the very least. It doesn't look like this is a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, so we don't know if there's an upgrade path, but <em>hopefully</em> there will be a way for fans to have that physical and have the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>Plus, the delay gives fans (like this writer) a chance to catch up on the series, especially with Trails in the Sky and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_vs_trails_in_the_sky_alternative_saga">Ys vs. Trails</a> spin-off coming out this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">announced</a> that its upcoming shooter, Marathon, has been delayed from its initial <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">September 23, 2025,</a> release date. No new release date was provided, instead Bungie said that the team would give players an update sometime this fall as to how the game's development is progressing, and would share a new release date at that time.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">blog post</a> from the Marathon development team, and is the most significant communication the team has had with players <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">since a live stream event</a> where Bungie addressed that a former artist on the Marathon team had used assets from artist Antireal without her permission.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you <span data-contrast="none">not only for your passionate feedback around the&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">Marathon&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="none">reveal and Alpha playtest, but also for your patience while we took the time to listen closely and chart our next</span></em> steps," Bungie began in the blog post.</p>
<p>"<em>Through every comment and real-time conversation on social media and Discord, your voice has been strong and clear. We've taken&nbsp;this&nbsp;to heart, and we know we need more time to craft&nbsp;Marathon&nbsp;into the game that truly reflects your passion.&nbsp;After much discussion within our Dev team,&nbsp;we’ve made the decision to delay the September 23rd release.</em>"</p>
<p>The post continues to say that the team will use the extra time from this delay to "<em>create the intense, high-stakes experience that a title like Marathon is built around</em>," and also specifies which areas of the game the studio will be immediately focusing on.</p>
<p>These areas include "<em>upping the survival game</em>," which Bungie clarifies to mean bringing "<em>more channeling and engaging AI encounters,</em>" as well as "<em>more rewarding runs, with new types of loot and dynamic events</em>," and&nbsp;<em>"making combat more tense and strategic</em>."</p>
<p>Bungie also adds that it will be "<em>doubling down on the Marathon universe</em>," which it describes as the team adding "<em>increased visual fidelity,"</em> along with "<em>more narrative and environmental storytelling to discover and interact with</em>," and "<em>a darker tone that delivers on themes of the original trilogy</em>."</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio also specifies that it will be working on improving the experience for solo and duo players, as well as adding proximity chat support to the game.</p>
<p>"<em>You'll hear from us again later this Fall when we can share the progress we've made, alongside the game's new release date</em>," Bungie continues. "<em>Thank you again for your patience and - much more importantly - your passion. Your continued feedback will help us make Marathon the incredible gaming experience we all know it can be</em>."</p>
<p>Realistically, this delay comes as no surprise. Beyond the fact that there were<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-rumor-of-no-marketing-plans-suggests-potential-delay/"> rumblings about a marketing campaign for the game</a> being canceled, the fact that there was clearly a significant amount of art assets used in designing the entire style and visual language of the game felt like a clear sign that it would take a lot of work to remove that and insert something that wasn't stolen.</p>
<p>Hopefully, when this fall rolls around, we can finally hear some good news about Marathon from Bungie, and not that the game continues to be in a development hellhole.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed.1221045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shocking-no-one-bungies-marathon-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an announcement that is surprising no one, Bungie has announced a&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>delay, meaning that you will not be seeing their extraction shooter on September 23rd.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Marathon Development Update">announcement</a>, Bungie shares that they came to this decision after reviewing the feedback from the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>alpha playtest, which had left many users feeling noplussed with the game. The announcement shares three areas of focus that they will be working on (among others):</p>

<ul><li>Improved survival game play
	<ul><li>Better and more difficult AI encounters</li>
		<li>Better rewards in loot and events</li>
		<li>Improving combat</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Setting and visuals
	<ul><li>Increased visual fidelity</li>
		<li>More environmental storytelling and narrative&nbsp;</li>
		<li>A darker tone like the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;trilogy</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Social Experiences
	<ul><li>Proximity chat</li>
		<li>Better player experience in single and duo play.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul><p>This work will be further informed by them continuing to playtest&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Marathon Release Date and First Gameplay Revealed">users who were in the Alpha</a>. These will be closed playtests, so if you weren't part of the playtest already, you shouldn't expect a chance to hop into&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;anytime soon.</p>

<p>The announcement doesn't state when they are going to release&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;now, but given that Sony had been recently touting it as releasing inside the fiscal 2025 year, it seems likely to be releasing during the first three months of 2026 if they can. Bungie states that they will be announcing the new release date and revealing the changes they've made over the summer sometime this Fall, perhaps even on the previous release date of September 23rd.</p>

<p>This isn't the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Destiny 2 Developer Bungie Suffers Layoffs Among Reported Delays for The Final Shape and Marathon">first delay</a> for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;as Bungie attempts to nail down this new format and get a live service formula for it that they believe can work. Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Concord Shutting Down, Sony Offering Full Refunds">high profile failure of&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>&nbsp;</a>last year, which was followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sony Cancels Two Live Service Games, God of War Reportedly Among Them">cancellations</a> of many first party 'games as a service' type projects at Sony Interactive,&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>is being counted on to demonstrate that Sony can make something in this field. Unusually this has to be shown to investors who want the money from a live service game, and gamers who may hesistate following how quickly Sony pulled the plug on their last attempt in the area.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the extra time should make sure that there's no <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Acknowledges Stolen Marathon Art, Promises &quot;Thorough Review&quot;">plagiarized art</a> in the next version of&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>&nbsp;right Bungie?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark and Darker</a> is a bit of a Schroedinger's video game, isn't it? Seemingly fleeting back and forth between a state of being available for sale and being outright delisted. Back in March, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> extraction game was delisted from the Epic Games Store, with developer Ironmace saying at the time that the "decision appears to be based on claims made by opposing parties in an ongoing legal dispute." 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Epic appear to be sending out emails to those that have the game in their libraries informing them that the game will no longer be playable this year (I've received this email myself as I apparently added it to my library at some point despite not having played it). 
</p>
<p>
"We removed Dark and Darker from sale on the Epic Games Store on March 5 in consideration of a court decision in Korea between Nexon and the game's publisher, Ironmace," Epic wrote in the email. "On November 1, 2025, we will be removing Dark and Darker from your library, at which point it will no longer be playable via the Epic Games Store." Anyone that paid for the Legendary Status upgrade will be getting a refund, though those that bought Redstone shards won't be. Both of these are no longer available for purchase as well.
</p>
<p>
The court decision Epic referenced is likely the <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250213/seoul-court-rules-pc-game-dark-and-darker-did-not-infringe-nexons-copyright-but-orders-compensation">one from February</a>, which found that Ironmace didn't infringe on Nexon's copyright of project P3, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexon-are-suing-dark-and-darker-developers-over-copyright-infringement">a game that Nexon alleged was then turned into Dark and Darker using stolen code and assets</a>. However, the court did also instruct Ironmace to pay Nexon 8.5 billion won (about $6.18 million) in damages.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, at this point in time it doesn't seem like the game is being booted off of Steam, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-following-accusations-of-stolen-trade-secrets">despite previously facing this in 2023</a>. It's a messy situation, one that I would guess isn't quite done yet.

It’s part of a “Play Anywhere” promise that includes PC, existing Series X/S consoles, Game Pass on TVs, cloud gaming, and first-party exclusives ported to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. It all sounds like a promising pivot away from the company’s shrinking console business, but it also raises lots of questions about what the future of Xbox will actually look like. </p><p>A new generation of Xbox consoles is coming, but will they be traditional consoles or mini-PC devices running an evolving version of Windows? Bond stresses compatibility with existing players’ current libraries of Xbox games, but most Xbox games haven’t been ported to PC and would need specialty solutions to maintain access at the hardware level rather than just making them playable with cloud gaming like Sony does with the PS3 generation. Will it even have a disc drive? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-physical-code-outer-worlds-1851784446?_gl=1*9060vv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAxNjYxNzQkbzEzMiRnMCR0MTc1MDE2NjE3NyRqNTckbDAkaDA.">Increasingly, the vibe appears to be no</a></span>. <br></p><p>Bond also emphasizes that the future of Xbox isn’t tied to a single store or device, once again opening the door to new hardware potentially supporting things like Steam, which has traditionally been a competitor to Windows gaming. Then there’s the bit about working to “ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming.” Unless that’s simply a nod to the fact that most PCs people play games on also run Windows, it sounds like a hint that the foundation of Xbox’s future will be Microsoft’s current cash cow OS with an Xbox layer overtop, rather than a bespoke platform built from the ground up for gaming as Xbox has previously been. <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren suggested as much in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his breakdown of the Xbox Ally last week</a></span>. </p><p>“Everything, everywhere, whenever you want” is a compelling marketing pitch that could easily become bedeviled by the details. As it stands, no single company controls as many pieces of the puzzle as Microsoft—software, hardware, and a massive publishing apparatus—but that doesn’t mean they will magically all start fitting together in a way that makes sense or doesn’t require tons of extra investment. And the other truth about Xbox at the moment is it seems burdened more than ever by they need to justify its P&amp;L to the larger company, which is otherwise all but obsessed with cloud computing and AI. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But this interview reveals that not all content from previous releases of the game will be present.</p>
<p>During the in-depth chat, the remaster’s director, Square Enix and Creative Unit III's Kazutoyo Maehiro, when asked about the biggest challenges involved, was quick to point out how the creation of this new version of the game was an arduous procedure.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067owxipj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The process saw the team faced with cobbling the remaster together from numerous versions and sources - mostly due to the fact a game's source code back from the PS1 version could so quickly be augmented or deleted in part, or even entirely. Maehiro says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone...</p>
<p>The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work - on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While The Ivalice Chronicles enhances the original game with a host of improvements, which include updated UI, new difficulty options, all-new voice acting and conversations, and modern quality-of-life features like autosave, battle speed changes and so on, the PSP content won't be included in this rerelease.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions">Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</a>, which launched in 2007 on Sony's portable handheld, is probably the most beloved version. It added in a Shakespeare-styled script, additional cutscenes, extra job classes in Dark Knight and Onion Knight, and a multiplayer mode. All of this has been dropped for 2025's version.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Maehiro explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions. However, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.</p>
<p>With this in mind, our first step in reviving Final Fantasy Tactics in the present was to adhere to the original and put a spotlight on the original game’s characters and jobs, as well as the original gameplay experience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst this is understandable, and the PSP version did also have some big performance issues, it's definitely a disappointment that we aren't seeing a big push for a fully inclusive final edition of sorts here. That also means the iOS version has been sidelined here, too.</p>
<p>The full interview is worth checking out via the link above, as Maehiro is full of lovely little tidbits of information about the process of putting the game together thus far!</p>

The show seems to be making multiple stops in several states, so if you can’t make it to one show, look and see if they’ve got another nearby you can swing. Alongside the aforementioned games which are headlining the concerts, they’ll also feature some selections from <em>Astro Bot</em>, <em>Journey</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, <em>Helldivers II</em>, and <em>Bloodborne</em>. All good picks if you were wanting to host a tribute to modern PlayStation, but I gotta say, I’m bummed we’ve got nothing that debuted on the original PlayStation or even the PS2. Yeah, <em>God of War </em>started on the second console, but the only games featured in the trailer for the show are from the Norse-themed reboot on the PS4.</p><p>Where’s my <em>Parappa the Rapper</em> medley? What about the sultry tones of a <em>Sly Cooper </em>song? You just put out a <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank </em>game on the PS5. Why are we forgetting the games that helped pave the way for the big prestige blockbusters? The show’s three months away, so there’s probably not a ton of time to shift the setlist around to spotlight older games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There was a specific moment that made Kat Abughazaleh realize the Democrats needed a new approach, and that maybe she could have a role to play. After years of warning politicians and the media about the right’s online tactics as a journalist, she watched everything she was afraid of play out during Trump’s 2025 inauguration.</p><p>“Everyone was sitting behind Trump [tech industry leaders like Musk, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook], and I was like, ‘Okay, maybe, maybe this is an exception.’ Maybe [Democrats will] do something. And then they just didn't,” she says. “I just wrote in my planner that day: ‘I'm gonna run for Congress.

Her campaign has faced criticism from both the right and the left: Some have suggested that her recent move to Chicago (personal, not political), along with her not living in the confines of the 9th District, makes her a potential politician unaware of what the district needs. (Abughazaleh began her run against incumbent Democrat <a href="https://rollcall.com/2025/05/05/jan-schakowski-illinois-democrat-retires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jan Schakowsky, who announced her retirement in early May.)</a> Others have suggested her internet fame means nothing in the Congressional arena.</p><p>Her campaign appears, at a glance, to be Very Online—with clapbacks, clever videos, and a keen eye for what can be meme-ed or mocked. But can that translate to the real world, especially for someone so young, and with so little tangible political experience?</p><figure><figcaption>Kat Abughazaleh</figcaption></figure><p>Abughazaleh routinely calls out establishment Democrats, dresses down detractors who rely on misogynistic tropes, has <a href="https://x.com/MattGertz/status/1653410599030738947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scared the shit out of Tucker Carlson</a>, been blocked by rabid anti-LGBTQ+ poster Chaya Raichik (Libs of TikTok) for years, and recently spent a lengthy deposition (“seven hours of the funniest transcript and video and I’ve never looked hotter,” she says) systematically tearing down the right-wing talking points of Elon Musk’s lawyers. Her required Congressional <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923074366415221013/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial disclosures show</a> just how little journalists make (she was salaried at $40,775 dollars with Media Matters), while her social media feeds show just how much shit they take. The results of her campaign are a long ways away, but her positions and how she communicates them are already speaking to a generation of young voters who feel disenfranchised and frustrated by the way the American government has operated in the post-Obama era.</p><p>Abughazaleh and I talk over FaceTime in early May, just a few days after an indistinguishable rightwing content creator <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1919071706888405018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wondered in a video if she was “just an e-thot flexing her Zoomer clout for votes”</a> while showing a picture of her in a bar, wearing a black crop top, black denim shorts, and black fishnets.&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh’s fashion preferences are regularly trotted out to try to discredit her, with a recent, <a href="https://www.chicagocontrarian.com/blog/chicago-social-media-influencer-congressional-candidate-kat-abughazaleh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pervy essay from the Chicago Contrarian</a> calling her a “social contagion” and referencing an old Instagram post in which she wears black lingerie and fishnet stockings.“Conservative men be normal about me once challenge,” she <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923477996742094908/photo/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of campaigns, especially establishment campaigns, would be like, ‘delete your social media,’” Abughazaleh says. “I kept it up very purposely—pictures of me bartending, that video of me taking a shot of Malort, or me in a Charizard onesie. Because first off, politicians are just people, and I think it's fine to have someone in an office who has fun and a personality, but also they just latch on to that…And you can just turn it around and be like, ‘Oh no, don't show everyone that I'm hot and fun and worked a service industry job.’ Nooo, don't do that.”</p><p>White House counselor <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trumps-adviser-made-shameful-dig-222036975.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alina Habba recently did this to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, showcasing the right’s tendency to use service work to denigrate women they’re afraid of. But Abughazaleh, unlike so many establishment Dems seemingly determined to play nice and safe in the face of rampant fascism (Tim Walz, who reinvigorated a young Democratic base by calling the GOP weird before he was muzzled by his own party, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/08/tim-walz-2024-campaign-critiques-00219718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently told Politico</a> his presidential campaign with Kamala Harris should have “rolled the dice more”), can and will clap back.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why Conservatives Hate Being Called &quot;Weird&quot;" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNwXK4iEfWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While people desperately <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">search for “left-wing Joe Rogan</a>” who can successfully blend culture with politics so that the former affects the latter, Abughazaleh brings a combination of a shit-poster’s biting wit and the research-backed expertise of a journalist to actual politics with her Congressional run. She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7OhclGO3CY&amp;t=23s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declares</a> it’s time for establishment Democrats to “drop the excuses and grow a fucking spine.” As the far right subsumes more of the internet, her website lists Musk, Raichik, and Carlson as “anti-endorsements,” and she turned the aforementioned Chicago Contrarian smear article into a nine-and-a-half-minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RUt6TX0Hmc&amp;ab_channel=KatAbughazaleh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube video.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“I’ve been called a slut, a whore, DEI Barbie, and every other name you could think of.

She’s well-versed in how the hateful ideologies they spread can bleed into our real world with relative ease.</p><p>“The Twitter main character of the day might not matter in the electorate, but the way the internet shapes politics now is very different from 2005…GamerGate and shit like that fed into Trump, Tucker Carlson used to farm stories from 4Chan to talk about on Fox…these things are very real, and the ways they affect us are very real,” she says.</p><figure><figcaption>Kat Abughazaleh</figcaption></figure><p>This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/09/january-6-insurrection-meme-wars/671397/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“wires to the weeds”</a> method, where things that happen online spread to the real world, has worked for right-wingers: After the first iteration of GamerGate in 2014, Trump’s former <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/07/18/steve-bannon-learned-harness-troll-army-world-warcraft/489713001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon admitted to utilizing angry gamers</a> to help boost the then-candidate’s reach and commandeer the 2016 election by flooding the playing field with shit. The establishment left has harnessed it with less success; Democrats have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/democrats-influencers-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to pay influencers</a> to try to take a slice of that digital pie in an attempt to build an influencer army like the one that helped push Trump into a second presidency. But it’s difficult to inorganically grow an ecosystem of rabid supporters, especially when popular sites like YouTube and now Twitter are <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php%5C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funneling users towards more reactionary content.</a></p><p>The right’s hateful ideologies used to remain on the margins of the internet, in spaces like 8Chan and KiwiFarms. Now, they’re taking over mainstream platforms like Twitter and YouTube. Streaming sites like Twitch have spawned numerous high-profile, reactionary content creators like Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt, who recently signed with the considerably more right-leaning platform Kick, just seven months after he was<a href="https://aftermath.site/asmongold-apology-palestine-hasan-piker-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> temporarily banned from Twitch for a racist rant against Palestinians</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The right has claimed a huge chunk of digital real estate, and now major social platforms are only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/06/14/trump-white-house-dhs-memes-deportation/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzQ5ODczNjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMjU1OTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NDk4NzM2MDAsImp0aSI6ImRlNWMwYWE1LWRlMzYtNDNkNC04MDMwLTVjZGZhOGExNWIyMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjUvMDYvMTQvdHJ1bXAtd2hpdGUtaG91c2UtZGhzLW1lbWVzLWRlcG9ydGF0aW9uLyJ9.12eK1j0nznkORxi6dIDNJGuf6shNUGn06krFSKCytDk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing</a> their square footage. This all happened, at least somewhat, organically, as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trust-and-safety-startups-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widespread tech industry layoffs</a> kneecapped trust and safety teams and <a href="https://www.freepress.net/big-tech-backslide-how-social-media-rollbacks-endanger-democracy-ahead-2024-elections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms rolled back hate speech protections</a> after leaders cozied up to Trump and his lackeys. Instead of dying after being exposed to sunlight, these reactionary beliefs survived, evolving ever so slightly to be somewhat more palatable to the general public. Today, most of the popular conservative content creators are savvy enough to avoid spewing outright slurs, but pepper their social media accounts with dog whistles.&nbsp;</p><p>The left may not be able to create a similarly successful network of influencers, or take back internet spaces covered in reactionary slime, but it <em>can</em> lean into its more internet-savvy, progressive candidates and let them loose. It’s unclear if Democrats will shift away from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_hCThhzWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michelle Obama’s 2016 imploration to “go high”</a> when conservatives go low and more towards what we briefly got a taste of when Tim Walz first stepped onto the campaign stage. Will Dems embrace the “dark woke,” an ideology that, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/style/dark-woke-democrats-jasmine-crockett-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, is “an attempt to step outside the bounds of the political correctness that Republicans have accused Democrats of establishing…being crass but discerning, rude but only to a point”? Or will they continue to try to “play nice” with a party increasingly overrun with zealots?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="&quot;What Should Democratic Resistance Look Like?&quot;: Kat Abughazaleh Talks Elon + Democrats w/ Jen Psaki" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1SdLdm15rCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Abughazaleh’s Congressional campaign could bridge this gap. However, that campaign faces challenges on the ground. She’s new to Chicago, having moved there last summer with her partner Ben Collins, who <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/the-onion-sold-g-o-media-global-tetrahedron-1235895683/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased the Chicago-based satire publication The Onion<em> </em>from my former employer, G/O Media, in April of last year.</a> She doesn’t live in the 9th District where she’s running, though she told the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/05/12/9th-congressional-race-schakowsky-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Tribune</a> she intends to move there. “There are plenty of districts that would be easier to carpetbag,” she told the outlet, referring to criticisms of her campaign. “I want to live where I want to live and run because it’s something I believe.”</p><p>But more than which district she lives in, there’s also the question of where she spends her time (online) and how (or if) that will translate to real-world action or appeal to real-world voters. Political strategist and Chicagoan Kitty Kurth recently suggested that Abughazaleh’s ability to get TikTok views won’t translate to votes at the polls, telling the Chicago Tribune<em> </em>in the aforementioned article that “it’s about knowing how to organize volunteers…you need someone who knows how to recruit volunteers and what to do with volunteers once you get them, and how to run a field operation. I don’t know that [Abughazaleh] has worked in a political organization, volunteered on a campaign, or knows what it’s like to run a petition drive.”&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh recently <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1923083746284113962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the creation of a volunteer Discord server</a>, asking for people to join who have “ideas or skills” that could help her campaign. She began holding daily office hours from 12-6, and <a href="https://x.com/KatAbughazaleh/status/1924511819541991609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants her campaign office to become “a community space where people can pick up resources</a>,” asking for donations of canned food, period products, Narcan, and nail clippers. She ran a food drive for Evanston Community Fridge, picketed with Northwestern University’s dining hall workers, walked in the recent anti-ICE protests, and hopes to teach potential constituents how to knit at her rather spacious campaign office. There is a concerted effort to make a local difference, to focus efforts and funds raised on mutual aid, to “materially improve as many lives as [she] can,” she tells me.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How My Congressional Campaign Is Feeding People Right Now | Kat Abughazaleh For Illinois" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMPmvoUaJa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Part of that mutual aid has involved helping people run against her: She tells me she has a hard out during our chat because “someone is coming in today that wants to run against me, so I’m going to show her how to go through the FEC [Federal Election Commission] paperwork. Primaries should be competitive.”&nbsp;</p><p>This commitment to helping her ostensible opponents was recently taken up by another progressive candidate who’s proven popular online (and in the polls, something Abughazaleh has not faced yet); in mid-May, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/zohran-mamdani?srsltid=AfmBOoqNixqeaSAc-Pw-7-xVa6GekXV5LWoZNEteFLZR0b7Yf0WTd5EYk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani</a> <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1924256260557361365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked potential donors</a> to instead send their money to New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is also running for mayor, in an attempt to block former governor and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/26/cuomo-sexual-harassment-doj-00138140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted sex pest Andrew Cuomo</a> from winning the Democratic primary in June. While Mamdani differs from Abughazaleh in that he’s been an elected politician since 2021 and is running for an entirely different office, the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/01/21/zohran-mamdani-instagram-tiktok-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online reach of his campaign</a> echoes hers, as does his demand that Democrats stop toeing the libertarian line and adopt more leftist ideologies.&nbsp;</p><p>These campaigns that blend the local and online are fairly new conceits (though they might remind New Yorkers of City Councilperson Chi Ossé’s 2021-2022 campaign), and they may not be successful–while <a href="https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani leads other Democrat mayoral candidates, and a recent (albeit small) poll has him ahead of Cuomo</a>, he still faces a challenge–but they mark the left’s first real and consistent attempt to harness the power of shitposting and online organizing in a post-Trump landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Both their campaigns draw on the enthusiasm of an audience tired of how the United States is a gerontocracy, run by desiccated Boomers who leave behind empty seats during one of the most crucial times in modern politics, with tight majorities and charged rhetoric edging us closer to the precipice of fascism. But by harnessing the power of the internet to get young folks out not just to the polls, but also to file their FEC forms, Abughazaleh hopes to take everything she’s learned about modern politics and political tactics and do something tangible.&nbsp;</p><p>“I want to give a permission structure to people—you don’t have to wait, no one is going to come and save us. We have to save ourselves,” Abughazaleh says. “If you want to run, do it, and this is how you do it.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/relooted-game-africa-museum-visa-nyamakop-interview"><h3>How Relooted, A Game About Reclaiming African Artifacts From Western Museums, Ended Up Being Shown By A White Guy At Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>"Fucked up to be making a game about reclaiming African artifacts that are in Western countries, and Africans can't even visit those artifacts"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

Many reviews have less than an hour of playtime, meaning they either didn't spend much time in the game, they bounced off of the gameplay quickly, or some combination of both.

<figure><a title="skull and co case review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/917cb4575b1ca/skull-and-co-case-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already had a look at Nintendo's official Switch 2 carry case and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">scored it a super solid 8/10</a>, commenting that it had too few cart spaces (at just six), but was nevertheless a compact and good-looking case for the money.</p>
<p>Now it's the turn of Skull &amp; Co., or 'Savage Raven' as the company has now rebranded, with the Switch 2 EDC Carry Case. I'll be honest, it makes me feel a little bit like I should really be dressing up as <strong>The Crow</strong> when I'm out and about with my console rocking a name like that on its little protective jacket, but hey, this is actually a very strong alternative to Nintendo's rather less street-wise offering. It also has two more cart spaces than that case. Upgrade unlocked!</p>
<p>You'll likely already be familiar with Skull &amp; Co. as they've become quite a big player on the accessory scene over the past few years. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we've previously reviewed the Switch OLED NeoGrip</a>, and I own a few other bits and pieces besides this case (which, for transparency, I bought with my own money in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch. Yes, I got a little excited. What of it?) So, as an owner of a few other items from the accessory-maker-formerly-known-as-Skull &amp; Co., I can tell you that this outfit makes some quality gear, and the story is no different here.</p>
<p>From the moment you pull this case from its packaging, you can feel the quality. This is a rugged offering in comparison to Nintendo's choice of smooth finish, and the black colour I've plumped for is understated (there are also 'multi-camo' and denim versions, if you prefer), which suits the impressively slim profile. Before I'd even gotten my Switch 2, this was actually the first time I realised just how slim the new console was going to be. It's ridiculous, and it helps the case tuck very easily into my rather small laptop bag, so it's good to go in terms of portability.</p>


<p>The case has two sturdy zips replete with nice little rubber logos, and a useful handle for when I want to carry it like I'm heading to a video gamer power meeting in the 1980s. The shell is composed of a tough 'Hardshell' material and the cover is water-resistant, too, something Nintendo's case does not have in its favour.</p>
<p>As I've already mentioned, it's wonderfully slim in profile, following the contours of the console closely, and making for a snug fit that <em>importantly</em> still has room enough for a console with its protective casing on. Nice work, folks! There is nothing more gutting than realising your shell has to come off every time. I've been in that war. I've felt that pain.</p>
<p>Inside, you're treated to a delightful velvet finish. Now, I'm not usually one for velvet at all, certainly not in its crushed variant, but here it's made for a surprisingly nice interior. It's soft, it feels luxurious, and your new console will undoubtedly love you forever, having been given such a comfortable and well-protected place to sleep.</p>
<p>More importantly, and perhaps of even more interest to you, dear reader, than how soft I find velvet in general, is the jazzy yellow strap which makes it nice and easy to lift the console out of its resting spot without resorting to pulling on the Joy-Con. You should note, too, that this case has got two extra spaces for game carts over the six found on the official Nintendo case alongside a nice little stretchy pocket, which could easily hold a further two carts if you don't mind pushing them in there.</p>
<p>Price-wise, in the UK you're looking at a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F473TTRC/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088201&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">£22.99 price tag</a> (in the US it's <a href="https://www.savage-raven.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2/products/savage-raven-by-skull-co-edc-carrying-case-for-nintendo-switch-2?variant=50452960280868">$29.99</a> but varying from $19.99 to around the $23 mark at the time of writing), which means it's just £2 more expensive than Nintendo's offering over here. Easily worth the extra, in my humble opinion, considering you get those two extra cart spaces.</p>

<p>Now, you do get a free screen protector bundled in with the Nintendo case, but to even things up Savage Raven has included a very nice cloth emblazoned with the Savage Raven logo, which I vastly prefer to a free screen-protector as I use these types of cloths to clean my glasses when I'm playing, so bonus brownie points to whoever made that decision as I've never had cleaner specta...I mean Switch 2 screens.</p>
<p>There is a bigger version of this particular case available, too, just as Nintendo has provided a bigger version of their own, and that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Maxcarry-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F47VD3KG/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088046&amp;sr=8-8&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">'MaxCarry' variant includes a further four slots for game carts</a>, up to a total of 12, plus a pouch for cables and accessories, pushing the price up to a still-fairly-reasonable £27.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are).</p>
<p>Overall, I'm more than happy with what I've got for just a few quid extra over Nintendo's case here. I prefer the duller/smarter finish over the shininess of the Big N's effort, and it helps that we've got a useful strap, extra spaces for carts. This case is water-resistant and can fit a Switch 2 console with a protective case or grip on. I'm also a fan of the use of colour inside this case as, alongside the velvet finish, it gives it a real premium look and feel when you crack it open for game time.</p>

			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a multi-year deal with AMD to power multiple gaming devices, including the successor of the Xbox Series X. Here's her complete statement from the brief video announcement:</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, our vision is for you to play the games you want, with the people you want, anywhere you want. That's why we're investing in our next-generation hardware lineup, across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories. I am thrilled to share we've established a strategic multi-year partnership with AMD to co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next generation Xbox consoles, in your living room, and in your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Together with AMD, we're advancing the state of art in gaming silicon to deliver the next generation of graphics innovation to unlock a deeper level of visual quality and immersive gameplay and player experiences enhanced with the power of AI, all while maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games.</em></p>
<p><em>This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device. That's why we're working closely with the Windows team, to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming. The next generation of Xbox is coming to life, and this is just the beginning.</em></p>

<p>It seems like Microsoft wanted to confirm in an official capacity what insiders had <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already mentioned</a>, such as the fact that the next-generation Xbox will still be compatible with previous-generation games through backward compatibility. Interestingly, Sarah Bond did not reiterate <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her previous remark</a> about the next generation Xbox console delivering the 'largest technical leap ever' for consoles, though it's hard to say whether that means fans should lower their performance expectations.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has bypassed the mid-generation refresh (unlike Sony with its PlayStation 5 Pro) and seems ready to get a headstart on the next generation. According to the latest rumors, the Series X successor might <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> in a couple of years.</p>

Fishing, I think, is the truest of all video game power fantasies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">Action</a> hero combat, romance wish fulfilment, god like abilities, all of that sort of thing pales in comparison to the act of fishing in a game. Just you, your rod, and a whole load of open water. I love to fish in video games, despite not being someone that has a strong desire to 100% genres like collectathons, I do love getting as many fish as I can, and I love a twist on the format. Enter Out Fishing, a mysterious sounding horror fishing game.
</p>

<p>
Where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> sees you setting out into the open ocean on a boat to get the eldritch catch of the day, Out Fishing almost takes a calmer, more laid back approach. You have your own little camp near a lake, you can improve things like your rod strength and your reeling speed. Classic gamey kind of things, things you'd expect from a cosier game than this one, but then there's the fact that if you stay past sunset, you're greeted with… something, in the forest. Don't know what, but I hate the woods at night, so I'm already just a little bit anxious thinking about it.

<p>
I also really like one of the key features listed over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660260/Out_Fishing/">game's Steam page</a>: "A single, horrifying goal: reel in the one thing that was never meant to be found." That could literally mean anything. A dead body? A really weird fish? Repressed memories of a traumatic event? That last one sounds likely given that the devs cited Silent Hill as an influence (alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mundaun">Mundaun</a>).
</p>
<p>
What I am curious about is how connected the horror elements will actually feel to the fishing side of things. I'm hoping the two will tie into each other rather than feeling like separate games. I won't find out for a while though, as there's no release date. I'll stick to the slightly less scary Sega Bass Fishing in the meantime.

Dash Food works similarly to Mushrooms, too: In addition to changing your appearance, you’ll get a speed boost.</p><p>However, not everyone who eats the same food item will unlock the same outfit. For example, if you’re racing as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy or Yoshi and you pick up a burger, you’ll get the Touring outfit. If you’re playing as Bowser, Wario or Waluigi, the burger will trigger the Biker outfit. Eat cake while you’re playing as any of the eight aforementioned characters plus Toad and Koopa and you’ll be wearing the Pro Racer outfit, but do so with Donkey Kong and you’ll get the All-Terrain outfit.</p><h2 id="h978765"><a id="2"></a>Complete challenges</h2><figure id="" data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While driving around the world map, you’ll come across the giant blue P-Switches that are found either on the side of the road or are lying somewhere off-road.

You can also find them in places you least expect, like a little islet beside the raging sea.</p><p>Peach Medallions are more like talismans than medallions because they lack a chain, but they’re medallions nonetheless. Unlike stocking up on rare coins IRL, collecting 10 of Peach’s coins will also unlock Mirror Mode.</p><h2 id="h978769"><a id="6"></a>Just take a relaxing drive!</h2><figure id="" data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Free Roam is perfect if you want to take a break from races and party battles with other players.

It was a sequence that proved so controversial at the time that the United Kingdom’s film board ordered it removed. 36 years later, after a remaster of the unedited version appeared on Disney+ in the UK, it’s been pulled once again.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197531" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="152" data-playlist="197531,196406,196115" data-current="197531"><div><p>Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23063.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Before <em>Terminator 2, Titanic, </em>and <em>Avatar </em>(and the many <em>Avatar</em> sequels), Cameron brought us <em>The Abyss</em>, a very expensive underwater action-adventure film starring Ed Harris. The movie was a bit of a flop at the time, but has since gone on to become a classic among Cameron fans and sci-fi nerds. </p><p>At one point in the film, a rat is placed in a small tub of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathing fluorocarbon liquid</a></span>. At first, the rat struggles and panics because it thinks it’s drowning. But eventually it calms and starts breathing the liquid, which contains oxygen. Five rats were used, and they all lived. However, many found the scene disturbing, and in the UK, this scene was banned and removed from all versions of <em>The Abyss </em>at the request of the RSPCA. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But this scene was later included in the Disney+ version of the movie</a></span>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was added to the service in April</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s the scene, but be warned that this is a real rat struggling to breathe and some might find it hard to watch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17, GamesRadar</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other outlets</a></span> reported that <em>The Abyss</em> had been removed from Disney+ after the RSPCA called out the media giant for including the scene and taking advantage of a “loophole” that allows streamers to ignore some local film and TV regulations. </p><p>“This isn’t about cancel culture—we’d welcome Disney Plus reinstating the film to their platform, just with this troubling scene removed—as is already the case in cinemas, on TV, and on DVD,” the RSPCA’s Head of Public Affairs said in a statement.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This was instead about highlighting a loophole that currently exists, allowing animal abuse scenes deemed unacceptable elsewhere to be streamed freely and legally into our homes—and protecting the public from having to see this animal abuse content.</p></blockquote><p> For many years, the film was difficult to watch, as it wasn’t available on streaming platforms and physical copies were out of print. But last year, a 4K version of the movie was finally released. Like some of Cameron’s other 4K releases, it makes some visual changes that people aren’t happy with, but overall, it is a fine way to watch <em>The Abyss</em>. However, in the UK, you can no longer watch this version on Disney+ because of that single, short scene involving a rodent. Hopefully, Disney adds the movie back with that scene removed so folks in the UK can enjoy this underrated Cameron classic once more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker/">Epic</a> has officially <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions">announced</a> LEGO Fortnite Expeditions, a new PvE mode that is launching tomorrow, on&nbsp;<strong>June 18, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Expeditions is a mission-based mode where you jump into various missions with three other players as a four-player co-op mode all with the aim of taking down a mysteriously masked villain, Mask Maker Daigo, who will destroy the world if you and your friends don't put a stop to his antics first.</p>
<p>You'll head out on these missions from your home base, the Supernova Academy, where you and the newly introduced heroes you'll play as, Shadow Caller, The Hunter, and Rift Ripper, are all training to become the next class of world-saving superheroes.</p>
<p>Epic also unveiled a gameplay trailer showing off each of the three hero classes in action, with Rift Ripper being extremely mobile and capable of reaching high areas with their Rift Jump and a Rift Dodge that works like a short-distance teleport.</p>
<p>Shadow Caller is very mobile in a different way, as they're able to hover above the ground while using magical projectiles to dispatch enemies. While The Hunter is a fast-moving ranged-focused class with a Bull's-eye Blade that can multiply the damage you do and make your attacks more accurate in battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Expeditions - Super Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the core powers each class has, you'll also be able to increase your damage output with what Epic is calling the 'Tools in the Toolbox,' which gives you the choice between Dual Daggers, a War Hammer, or Plasma Pistols, to add an extra punch to combat.</p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite Expeditions will be available tomorrow and will be found in Discover in LEGO Fortnite, or it can be accessed from Odyssey and Brick Life using the Battle Bus Station.</p>

        <p>How much is that per minute?</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> publishers HoYoverse are suing a player for $150,000 over a pre-release stream of a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a> character.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse">reported</a> by Nicole Carpenter over on the Gamefile newsletter (paywall), the Singapore-based publishers are taking one Alfredo Lopez to court after he broadcast an early look at Castorice, a melancholy floral dragon summoner, to a Discord channel with around 12,000 members. The lawsuit was filed on June 6th in the United States District Court's Central District of California.</p>
<p>According to HoYoverse's copyright claim, Lopez has "unfairly or unlawfully obtained a game update before its release date", but the suit appears more vexed by Lopez sharing footage of the character, than how he obtained the game build in question. </p>
<p>They argue that a leak such as this "dampens the excitement and anticipation that many players feel when they obtain the update legitimately upon its official release." It's worth noting that Castorice had already been revealed as an upcoming addition to the game - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-honkai-star-rail-amphoreus-trailer-featuring-castorice-revealed-the-game-awards-2024">during last December's Game Awards, no less</a>. </p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a live service gacha game, with around 70 characters at the time of writing. Jason Coles thought it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/honkai-star-rail-review">good fun</a> back in April 2023. I can see how the publisher of a game which thrives on the lure of randomly served or microtransacted anime fancy-dans might be extra prickly about having the goods screened ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on billion-dollar publishers suing Discord streamers into the scorched earth over footage of a character we already know about.</p>
<p>As Carpenter comments in the newsletter, HoYoverse have proven <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-43885b83-8690-4687-9574-a8029abd586f.html?stream=top">pretty militant about going after leakers in the past</a>, though they're hardly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-sue-over-fortnite-superhero-leak">alone in this</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
