		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for March&nbsp; 2025 have been announced and if you bought Dragon Age: The Veilguard just four months ago then you are going to be a bit miffed.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus March 2025 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be March 4th, and they will be available until March 31st.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard | PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sonic Colors: Ultimate | PS4</strong></li>
<li><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard launched on October 31st 2024 with lots of positive reviews, including one from us which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/10/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/">scored the game 8/10.</a></p>
<p>“The Veilguard is a beautiful-looking and highly enjoyable game, and a nice return to a more focused feeling RPG that does justice to both Dragon Age as a series and also to Bioware,” said Jason in his review. “It’s fun to play in the moment-to-moment, the big decisions feel impactful and worthwhile, and fans of the series will be happy to be running around chasing after that lamentable egg of an Elf once more.”</p>

<p>Since then EA have said the game failed to meet sales expectations and cancelled DLC plans, so it looks like they are trying to rake back a little more cash by getting Sony to pay for it to come to PS Plus.</p>

<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate is rather older and was released way back in 2021.&nbsp; We did not review it but has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-colors-ultimate/">Metacrtic score of 74 o</a>n PS4 so that sounds pretty good to me.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Colors: Ultimate - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3MCqTdsVKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is from 2022 and collects thirteen classic Konami Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles games in to one pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-78FD9xvc0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Our retro expert Adrian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">reviewed the pack and it also scored 8/10</a>.</p>
<p>“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection is a must for any Turtles fan,” he said. “The emulation here is flawless and the range of accessibility enhancements is very welcome. In fact, the treasure trove of behind-the-scenes content is worth the asking price alone. Sure, there’s a some ‘classic’ games included that won’t live up to nostalgic memories, but ignore the dross and you’ll have a blast with the near-essential selection of scrolling beat ‘em up TMNT goodness.”</p>

			<p>Today, The Chinese Room has <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-the-cast-of-mortals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 developer diary dedicated to the game's mortal non-player characters (NPCs). As the World of Darkness Head of Creative Management Karim Muammar puts it, vampires can only be striking if they have a mortal backdrop.&nbsp;Bloodlines 2 will feature several human NPCs who are, however, either knowingly or unknowingly, still entangled with the vampires of Seattle.</p>
<p>For example, Pandora Graves is a young girl that protagonist Phyre will meet in a bar. She knows quite a bit about the Kindred, and yet doesn't appear to realize the danger she's in by putting herself so close to vampires. Then there's Verona De Lancey, the offspring of wealthy parents who decided to come to the big city to search for more excitement. Apparently, she got more than she bargained for, having received a death threat in her handbag after a single night in Seattle.</p>
<p>Dale Beecher, on the other hand, is aware that Kindred society exists but only occasionally crosses paths with them, even though, from the description, he sounds like some kind of alchemist vendor. Biker Guru says he's able to sense ghosts, but seems unfazed by that fact. He can usually be found close to the rest of his biker friends near The Dutchman bar.</p>

<p>Carla was a dedicated paramedic, but she parted ways with her employers after something went wrong in their work relationship. However, she still looks out for the people of Seattle, dispensing medicine on the city's streets. Then there's Reggie, a bum with a philosophical view of the city, how it works, and where he can make a difference. He haunts Pioneer Square and usually has a good idea of what's going on in the streets nearby.</p>
<p>Marigold is a familiar figure on the streets near Atrium. She's been conducting her trade with passers-by for a long time and now also offers fortune-telling through astrology. Shelby was a trader in a major financial organization until six months ago when she received a revelation. Now, she walks the streets of uptown Seattle, making sure everyone is well aware of the coming rapture, although, according to her, there's nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Wheeler is a trustworthy officer of the Seattle Police Department. However, he has problems with his memory from time to time and is aware that things aren't quite the way they should be. Lastly, Mr. Lemon is a drunkard who has been in the Seattle Police Department's drunk-tank for a few days now and still hasn’t sobered up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Dev Diary #27 - Mortals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRqWPYYIUbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to The Chinese Room, players will influence the lives of all these mortal NPCs (and more) in one way or another when going through Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The next developer diary is scheduled in two weeks and will focus on Hunters. The game is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-tentatively-slated-for-first-half-of-2025-but-paradox-intends-to-license-out-a-potential-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Before you even get to control your character in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>, you've already fucked up. Alta has lost in the arena, her defeat a swift and ignoble end to three years as unbeaten champion. She is, in her own words, a ruinous "failure". To retrain and come back fiercer than ever, she pops into the forest looking for a legendary trainer, only to find herself waking up exhausted in front of a picturesque tea shop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam demo</a> that follows will see you harvesting plants, making tea, and arguing a lot with the shop's owner, a gentle giant who thinks that maybe what Alta really needs is just some time to rest. After all, you can't fail at drinking a cuppa.

<p>
The demo (released as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>) is basically the opening of the game, heavy on the story and introducing our hamstrung hero and her new friend Boro, the hulking optimist who owns a tea shop but is basically a giant therapist. I want to talk about the character-driven storytelling more than the gamey stuff you'll be doing day to day around the tea shop. But I think it's helpful to know what kind of cosiness you're in for, so let's quickly summarise the basics.
</p>
<p>
You're making tea, but that includes all the farming involved before the first flush. The small field outside the shop is arranged in a hex pattern, and you can sow seeds in certain patterns to instantly bloom different types of plant. Sow in a line to get a small hybrid plant with blue seeds. Sow those same seeds in a three-point star pattern to create a large hybrid that'll offer harvestable fruit for the teas. 
</p>
<p>
You'll dry tea-leaves in a box with a timer, collect the resulting tea balls, and clamber up a giant central tea infusion machine, sliding about on ladders, pulling ropes and puffing bellows and kicking levers to get the hot water flowing. The tea spills out a spiral funnel in the bottom with the pleasing flow of a chemistry set you got for Christmas. There is something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc9h6FC6QgU">very Dick Van Dyke</a> about the internal decor of the house. Little toy trains wheel in and out of waterfalls and heaters - a washing machine for tea cups. Automatic saloon doors open the way from room to room with a satisfying creak. You can tune some knobs to change the music playing in the shop. The radio has three stations: "horse", "dog", and "cow".

<p>
This is all very cosy and rosy, but what does it have to do with failure, and how we cope with the idea of it? Well, most of what's on show is not selling the game itself but the protagonist and her problems. Alta has been pushing herself past the point of terrible burnout. She runs back into the forest again and again to escape the tea shop, using anger and fear as a fuel source, not yet understanding that such fuel burns hot and fast and pumps out poison like any petrol-hungry combustion engine. She eventually collapses every time you leave the tea shop's restful glade. 
</p>
<p>
The game's co-writers, Davey Wreden (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-beginners-guide">The Beginner's Guide</a>) and Karla Zimonja (of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>) have spoken about how the game is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/14/wanderstop-challenging-cosy-fantasies-davey-wreden-pc-ps5-game">a personal story of burnout</a>, and the restorative power of "daily rituals that anchor us in our lives". And playing this opening I can see what they mean. The core struggles Alta faces are difficulties a lot of us can relate to. At one point she talks about a previous dream - to smithy her own sword. But she gave up on the idea because to be "great" at blacksmithing would take a lifetime in itself, and nothing but the best-made sword would do. In Alta's mind, she only had enough life for one goal: to be the greatest arena fighter.

<p>
This is a kind of all-or-nothing thinking any perfectionist will recognise, and one that can lead to despair as easily as it leads to success. Pouring the entirety of your life's efforts into one vessel at the expense of all others comes naturally to those who want to specialise and excel. A lot of us (I include myself here) have funneled a life and identity into the mental coffee cup that accompanies us to work every day. But when something goes wrong and that career cup shatters, for whatever reason, the cold caffeine stains of "failure" seep into everything around you. Suddenly, after years of over-achieving, you're a fuck-up. There are two reactions: double down and try harder, or give up entirely. All or nothing.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, there's a lot of emotional baggage to unpack in Wanderstop, even in this short demo. When it ended after an hour or so, I was left thirsty for more. I want to see Alta get better because I know the restorative value of taking a horse-sized chill pill and learning to sit down and do nothing but breathe air for an hour at a time. I have learned that there is something - lots of things - between "all" and "nothing". And I'd feel warm and fuzzy if this extremely angry man stabber comes to see this too. 
</p>
<p>
I'm also looking forward to how the game will interrogate the "cosy" farming genre, which is traditionally replete with crafting cogs and seasonal deadlines that easily turn otherwise relaxing games into yet more efficiency-driven taskbox ticking. If the goal here is to show Alta that she doesn't need to always push herself, doesn't need to be "productive" all the time, then I'm keen to see how the game design reinforces that idea. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and its ilk are great distractions, a green-thumbed escape from daily concerns. But there has long been room for a game to come along and think more deeply about why those games are so popular. Exactly what are we trying to escape when we plant another row of parsnips? I'm hopeful Wanderstop has an interesting answer. It's due out March 11th.

It definitely doesn’t seem fake, but I share the rest of the sentiment. I’ve fallen off <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> pretty hard in recent weeks, in part because it feels like my pulls in  Space-Time Smackdown have been demonstrably worse on average than when the game first came out. I’m not getting as many of those dopamine bursts from finding rare cards, and my list of Wonder Picks to choose from has been pretty garbage too. </p><p>Maybe a better battle meta can fix some of that malaise.

Up to this point, Psychic decks have ruled the roost. Mewtwo ex, combined with the Energy generation of Gardevoir, inflicted such high burst damage that it held fast as one of the game’s most dangerous cards since launch. Now it seems Mewtwo ex’s meta-dominating days will come to an end, as another card has quickly overtaken its throne.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Darkrai ex might not look like much at first glance, but make no mistake, it’s not a card you can ignore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1igvj3s/spacetime_smackdown_weekend_1_tournament_meta/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1igvj3s/spacetime_smackdown_weekend_1_tournament_meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of fan-run tournaments following Space-Time Smackdown’s release</a></span> showed Darkrai ex was immediately dominating 35.7 percent usage rate, nearly doubling the 16.7 percent usage of Palkia ex in the second place slot. Meanwhile, the once-feared Mewtwo ex had dropped to merely 2.1 percent. Darkrai ex’s rise to prominence isn’t because it hits hard or has a ton of HP—instead, it’s how it fits into the ways Space-Time Smackdown has changed the competitive landscape of the game, rendering many previously viable strategies borderline obsolete.</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here, so check out our breakdown below to understand just why Darkrai ex has spiked so hard in popularity.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: No matter how much I may or may not hype up any cards in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, I <em>do not </em>encourage you to spend money on the game, even if you have cash to spare. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gacha-loot-box-gambling-1851690838">This is a gacha game at its core</a></span>, and with that comes aggressive psychological manipulation to encourage you to spend more than you normally would.

Whenever you place a Dark Energy from your Energy Zone on Darkrai ex, it will immediately inflict 20 damage on your opponent’s active Pokémon. Because this is an <em>ability</em> and not an <em>attack</em>, this will bypass damage reduction effects like Melmetal’s Hard Coat ability or counterattacks like Druddigon’s Rough Skin. <strong>Most importantly, Nightmare Aura works while Darkrai ex is on the bench</strong>. This means that, with the right setup, Darkrai ex can consistently boost your damage output by 20 per turn. That might not sound like a lot, but when cards like Giovanni can completely change the tide of a game by adding 10 damage to a single attack, you can imagine how Darkrai ex can swing matches in your favor.</p><p>Yet as mentioned above, Darkrai ex itself is only a small slice of why it’s so widely used. It’s how it synergizes with Space-Time Smackdown’s new Trainer Cards that make it so evil.</p><figure id="" data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-recommend-id="image://89a2b53f0235dfa51002a78c082d60aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Dawn Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h354561"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Trainer Cards to use with Darkrai ex</strong></h2><p>Two new Trainer Cards in particular elevate Darkrai ex to especially dangerous heights. The first of these is <strong>Dawn</strong>, which lets you transfer one Energy from your benched Pokémon to your active Pokémon. <strong>It’s a useful card in isolation, but also a fantastic tool if you want to activate Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability from the bench <em>and </em>build up your active pokemon so it can attack too</strong>. This pairs especially well with low Energy cards like Weezing and Weavile ex, both of which require only one Energy to attack.</p><p>The biggest game-changer, though, is <strong>Cyrus</strong>. In fact, <strong>Cyrus is arguably <em>the</em> most meta-shifting card in Space-Time Smackdown, even beyond Darkrai ex</strong>. The way it works is simple: if your opponent has a Pokémon on their bench that has taken damage, you can swap it to the active slot. Prior to Space-Time Smackdown’s release, decks loaded with ex cards thrived because players could retreat strategically. After all, it doesn’t matter if ex cards are worth two points upon being knocked out if you can deny your opponent the chance to finish them off. Now that dynamic is turned on its head; if your opponent has an ex Pokémon with low health on their bench, you can plan on claiming those two points the moment you draw a Cyrus.</p><figure id="" data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-recommend-id="image://d73797895f021c1723f949e38ffcfe72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image of the Full Art Cyrus Trainer Card from Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, attacking a weak benched monster wasn’t <em>impossible </em>before. Cyrus just makes it a <em>lot </em>easier, and it slots into any deck.</p><p>Darkrai ex’s synergy with Cyrus is two-fold. On one hand, it allows you to use Cyrus on an opponent’s Pokémon with only 10 to 20 HP remaining, knock it out with Nightmare Aura, and then use your active Pokémon’s attack on whoever your opponent decides to switch in afterwards. Conversely, <strong>because Darkrai ex is ideally kept on the bench until the late game, it isn’t as vulnerable to a surprise Cyrus switch-in</strong>. Keep it at full health on your bench, make sure you have at least one other Pokémon in reserve in case your opponent has Sabrina, and wait until you’re already down two points before putting Darkrai ex in to clean up the rest of the game.</p><p>Caption: An image of the Giant Cape Pokémon Tool Trainer Card from <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em>.</p><p>This isn’t even getting into the new <strong>Pokémon Tool </strong>cards, which can be equipped on Pokémon to either boost their max HP or inflict damage on opponents when they attack. Both of these effects favor tactics that stall the game and encourage chip damage, which Darkrai ex fits into perfectly. You have a perfect storm of ways that Darkrai ex decks can sweep the floor with virtually any opponent.</p><h2 id="h354562"><a id=""></a><strong>Darkrai ex fits into virtually any dark-type deck</strong></h2><p>Darkrai ex is one of the first Dark-type ex cards added to the game, and I’d go as far as to say it makes any Dark-type deck better. Whether you use it with Weezing, Weavile ex, or even Arbok, it adds so much to your team and leaves very little room for your opponent to exploit it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The continuation of Assassin’s Creed takes us to Japan, and we’re curious to see if we can play hop on a quicker flight and secure Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>‘ content will come to <em>light </em>soon enough. Ubisoft is looking to vacate the shadows after a turbulent 2024 where nothing went right. The company has seen better times with countless layoffs to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> and other projects announcing their closure hitting hard.</p>



<p>But Ubisoft is looking to turn a corner with Assassin’s Creed Shadows. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pre-orders are red hot</a>, and interest in Shadows is almost scalding. Let’s see whether potential Early Access has had a say in the game’s pre-release success and hype.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-shadows-early-access">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Guess I’ll have to take measures into my own hands. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no Early Access for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and it is set to release simultaneously for everyone.</strong></p>



<p>Shadows doesn’t have online multiplayer, so there’s no component for players to get an edge on each other. However, many single-player games are opting to negate Early Access. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and Baldur’s Gate 3 are classic examples of games being made for players.</p>



<p>They opted against Early Access, and it seems Ubisoft has decided to follow suit.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-why-assassin-s-creed-shadows-doesn-t-have-early-access">Do we Know Why Assassin’s Creed Shadows Doesn’t Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Curiously, Ubisoft hasn’t revealed why they’ve canceled Assassin’s Creed Shadows Early Access, merely stating that the Collector’s Edition no longer has the early bonus.</strong></p>



<p>Thanks to <a href="https://igamemag.com/assassins-creed-shadows-early-access-canceled-ubisoft-confirms-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iGame Magazine</a>, we can see the original Discord Q&amp;A addressing the cancelation of Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Early Access.</p>



<p>Under a question about the Collector’s Edition titled “Will I still get the 3 days of Early Access as advertised,” a Ubisoft developer says: “<strong>No, there is no Early Access for AC Shadows anymore.</strong>“</p>



<p>Is this out of the goodness and thoughtfulness of Ubisoft’s heart? Or is it a way to improve their standing and put gamers before business first? We may never get a proper answer to this question.</p>



<hr>



<p>It looks like we’re all diving into Assassin’s Creed Shadows blind. I’m interested to hear your thoughts: Should the concept of pre-order Early Access be scrapped for good? Or is it a worthwhile bonus for the most committed of fans? </p>

<p>Hextech Chests are coming back to League of Legends, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-devs-defend-unpopular-hextech-chest-changes-promise-better-battle-passes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their removal at the start of 2025 sparked massive outrage within the player base</a>. In Riot’s most recent Dev Update, the League team acknowledged that many of their previous changes didn’t go over well with the community.</p>



<h2 id="h-hextech-chests-are-coming-back">Hextech Chests Are Coming Back</h2>



<p>Beginning in Act 2, with the release of patch 25.05 at the start of March, Hextech Chests will officially return. Going forward, there will be 10 Hextech Chests available for players to earn each act, which translates to 60 per year across six acts. </p>



<ul>
<li>Eight will be available in the free Pass of each act.</li>



<li>Two more can be earned through the Honor system.</li>
</ul>



<p>Previously, before they were removed, Hextech Chests were earned through the Champion Mastery system. The returning chests will be exactly the same as the ones previously earned through Champion Mastery, but they should be more “accessible” through the pass.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A number of other changes are being rolled back or addressed in the upcoming past. Blue Essence cost for all champions will be reduced by 50 percent, and more Mythic Essence is getting added to the pass rewards system. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h56OC1gqAM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial announcement</a> that Hextech Chests were being removed drew a ton of backlash, with several players threatening to boycott the game altogether. Executive Producer Paul “Pabro” Bellezza and League head Andrei “Meddler” van Roon addressed the team’s goals for Riot’s flagship title:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We want to acknowledge that we know getting League to the right place isn’t about just one set of changes. It’s about continually refining and improving the game. We think today’s updates are an important step, and we’ll keep tracking how these changes feel, talking with all of you about how things are landing, and making adjustments. We’ve always built League along with all you, the community. Thank you for sticking with us and hearing us out, and we look forward to continuing to work with you to make sure League is the best game it can be. Thanks so much, and we’ll see you on the Rift.”</p>
</blockquote>

A demo is available now as part of Steam Next Fest: February 2025 Edition. <span id="more-946761"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446600/Dark_Deity_2/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em><a title="Games > Dark Deity [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dark-deity">Dark Deity</a></em> is back! A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p><p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p><p>Put simply, <em>Dark Deity II</em> is about playing your way, all the way.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Strategize and Prevail</strong></p><p>Turn-based tactical combat is at the heart of <em>Dark Deity II</em>. Your 20 heroes have access to 45 branching classes, each with its own powerful abilities, passive effects, and its own tactical niche…</p><p>…that’s until you start experimenting with skills, abilities, and gear that can completely change the way a unit performs in the field and upend your tactics in a good way..</p><p>Heroes will bond as they fight seemingly impossible odds. Hardship forges the strongest bonds… but can also destroy friendships and wreak havoc. Will you be able to walk the line between the two?</p><p><strong>Make Your Decisions Wisely</strong></p><p>A desperate defense against an overwhelming foe. A land in the grasp of war fever, panic, and factional strife. A traitor around every corner. To have a chance at winning the war, you’ll need to make some difficult choices.</p><p>Verroa is torn apart by factions, and many of these factions are fractured in turn. Decide who to support and who to throw to the wolves—but weigh each option carefully. After all, your choices may drastically change the coming battles…</p><p>Every choice can fundamentally change the way you play the game. No two playthroughs are the same and what goes right in one game can go terribly wrong in the other.</p><p><strong>Twist the Threads of Destiny</strong></p><p>No playthroughs are going to be the same, but you can push <em>Dark Deity II</em> even further. Inspired by roguelites, we created the Twisted Destiny mode, allowing you to play through a shortened version of the campaign, featuring a randomized team on every playthrough, a host of new levels and modified existing ones, and unlock rewards for future playthroughs—which can completely change the way you play them!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dark Deity 2 Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iqhrob2ruCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Players are still very much focused on a handful of live-service games, as over 70 percent of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players in the US played at least one of the top 10 live-service games in January.</p>
<p>Further, more than 40 percent of all playtime in the US in January across those consoles was spent on those same 10 live-service games.</p>
<p>That's according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, based on Circana's Player Engagement Tracker. "Used to be that players would jump from big game to big game to some other games but they were most often moving to something new that they purchased," he surmised. "Now, the live-service games suck out a ton of available time, and it's hard to beat free if it's good."</p>

<p>He continued: "Really could use some positive surprises this year, and for a bunch of things to go right in 2025. So a lot is riding on the new products coming to market this year to hopefully combat or reverse some of these trends."</p>
<p>Namely, he's referring to the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's Switch 2</a> and its subsequent new games, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">hotly anticipated GTA 6</a>.</p>
<p>Piscatella's analysis speaks to the dominance of live-service games in the industry, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Roblox. And while other studios have attempted to cash in on the live service trend, they've struggled to compete with established franchises.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/older-games-like-fortnite-account-for-over-60-of-playtime-new-report-suggests">further report last year from Newzoo</a> found games at least six years old accounted for more than 60 percent of playtime in 2023, with Fortnite the top game across all platforms that year.

<p>Sony in particular has struggled with live service projects - last month it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two in-development games</a> from Sony Bend and Bluepoint.

			<p>Sonic Rumble is a new party game from Sega inspired by the highly popular party game Fall Guys. The title was originally meant to launch at the end of 2024, but unfortunately, that didn't happen. This news was announced in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> by Sega, where they went on to tease some of the features that people can expect to see in the game. Sega also went on to say:</p>
<p><em>We would like to extend a huge thank you to our players and Sonic fans for their patience in waiting for the global launch of Sonic Rumble. The team is committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans with even more new game mechanics, new features, and more exciting content to look forward</em> to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Rumble - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the game doesn't have a set release date yet, Sega has confirmed that the game will be coming in Spring, and even included a roadmap for the game within the blog post.</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble was already available to some degree in a pre-launch early-access period, where players would get to experiment with a limited amount of features. With the game's full global launch coming in Spring 2025, this will take the game to 1.2.0, where a competitive game mode will be added, as well as a feature called "Crew," which will allow players to team up together and play Sonic rumble.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to dedicate a significant amount of time to the game, a game mode named Quick Rumble will also be available for players at launch. Instead of a full-scale match, this instead provides matches that last one round and is perfect for those players out there who may not like long play sessions or those who don't have much time to spare.</p>
<p>In addition to the three features, Sega also spoke about how it is making Sonic Rumble "truly unique."</p>
<p><em>We're making Sonic Rumble truly unique by embracing the abilities of your favorite characters from across Sonic's universe. Ever wanted to stun rivals with Amy's Piko Piko Hammer? Now you can!</em></p>
<p>Selected characters will have a certain set of unique abilities that will give those who play them the potential to get an advantage by utilizing the abilities and help keep the gameplay fresh.</p>
<p>When Sonic Rumble does release, it will be available on iOS and Android, as well as on PC via Steam. It's not certain yet whether there are plans to bring this game to console or whether the next big release on console will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a> first, which is set to release later this year on console and PC.</p>

<p>Sony has announced the three new games available for free for all PlayStation Plus subscribers for March 2025 will be Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Sonic Colors: Ultimate and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</p>



<p>All <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/26/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-march-dragon-age-the-veilguard-sonic-colors-ultimate-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection/?sf276488366=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">three of the games</a> will be available for PlayStation Plus members starting March 4. As with past monthly games, once you add them to your library, they will be available to download at any time as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>The games will be available until March 31.</p>



<h2 id="h-march-2025-s-free-playstation-plus-games">March 2025’s Free PlayStation Plus Games</h2>



<p>Of the games coming to the service in March, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the most notable. Released in October 2024, Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s response was mixed from both critics and consumers. The game failed to meet EA expectations, with the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-didnt-meet-revenue-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying it missed targets</a> by nearly 50%. Developer BioWare has also since made changes, including layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>Sonic Colors: Ultimate was released in September 2021 and sees you play as Sonic on a journey to free Wisps that were captured by Dr.  Eggman. Lastly, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection was release in  August 2022 and includes a collection of 13 games released between 1989 and 1994.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t picked up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February’s free games</a>—Payday 3, High on Life, and Pac-Man World Re-Pac—you have until March 3 to do so.</p>



<p>In addition to the new games for PlayStation Plus subscribers, those who are on Extra and Premium memberships <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-gets-9-games-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received nine new games</a> to the PlayStation Game Catalog this month.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A couple of months after the unveiling, CD Projekt Red has decided to pull the curtains back to showcase how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4's</a> debut trailer came together in partnership with <a href="https://platige.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platige Image</a>. The developer discusses that a major theme was showcasing how Ciri is somewhat of a mirror to a Stromford girl named Mioni.</p><p dir="ltr">The behind-the-scenes video for The Witcher 4 (seen below and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a>) begins with director Sebastian Kalemba stating "that this is the moment to tell the story with Ciri." From there, the RPG's narrative director Philipp Weber opens up about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/">The Witcher 4's first trailer</a>--which debuted at The Game Awards in December--follows how two women approach destiny differently.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGJ-B7v5tYI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We were thinking in the story that Mioni and Ciri are a little bit mirrors of each other," Weber said. "The traditions of Stromford essentially mean that Mioni has to be sacrificed. That's her destiny, and she accepted that destiny. Ciri is known as someone who does not accept destiny, she fights back at it."</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red notes that the reveal trailer highlights this mirroring from the get-go, as Mioni gets dressed in a village tradition and Ciri prepares in a Witcher style. Additionally, the developer points out that Ciri does things differently than Geralt would do. Last month, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-voice-actor-is-excited-to-see-the-witcher-4-focus-on-ciri/1100-6528960/">expressed his excitement about The Witcher 4 focusing on Ciri</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the mirroring theme, the behind-the-scenes video gives insight into the production of the RPG's debut trailer. For example, Platige Image says the motion-capture session lasted around 14 days, with another three days spent for on-site shooting and testing. There's discussion about the Slavic style being used artistically as well as the animation behind the Bauk monster.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time CD Projekt Red has elaborated on the trailer, either. After the unveiling in December, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/">Kalemba broke down The Witcher 4 trailer</a> and confirmed the story within the video will be seen in-game. GameSpot also got a chance to chat with Kalemba <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/">about Ciri, Gwent, and in-game romance</a>. There is no release date yet for the game.</p>

Well, here's a surprise. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will be part of Sony's PlayStation Plus Essential Games for March.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's big role-playing game only launched four months ago, so it's a surprise to see it included within the subscription service so soon.
</p>
<p>
Reception to the game has been mixed, with a solid launch last October and a decent critical response not translating into sales. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA said the EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed"</a>. This month, its boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">Andrew Wilson suggested the game might have performed better if it was live-service</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Plus Essential games for March 2025 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above join the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 4th March, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth major entry in its long-running fantasy series, and its first in a decade. It picks up storylines from across the franchise so far and ties many of them up - but it's also a good point for new players to drop in. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 dock has arrived today, thanks to some new pictures shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2dH7Za0#n35dYx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new pictures</a>, which have been shared online by the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year as reported on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4119">Famiiboards forums</a>, provide a new look at the console's dock, highlighting some of the changes over the current dock, including what looks like a grid on the base of the dock, which suggests a change in the cooling and air intake over the current model.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-awaited reveal last month, Nintendo has kept pretty silent about its new system and will likely continue to do so until the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd Nintendo Direct</a>. According to a former Nintendo employee, the event won't only go over the Nintendo Switch 2 features that were briefly teased in the reveal trailer, but will also likely confirm the console's release date, which is speculated to be sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">June</a> for a few reasons, so there's the chance that we won't have to wait much longer to learn when it will finally launch worldwide.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches this year. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fear-gog-preservation-program-monolith<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that it's adding 2005 horror shooter&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>to its Preservation Program ahead of schedule in order to "recognize" the contributions of shuttered developer Monolith.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, GOG says that while&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>- which collects the base game and its expansions - was due to be added at "a later timeframe", the release has been accelerated to honor Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>For context, it was revealed yesterday that Monolith was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">closed down by parent company Warner Bros</a>, and that the studio's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game has been canceled.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First was also shut down following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">failure of the crossover fighter</a>, as was mobile studio Warner Bros San Diego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=NhAk4SMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/f.e.a.r.-gog-preservation-program-shooting.jpg?itok=p7q3MxAQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em>is now a part of the GOG Preservation Program.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.</em>, GOG says that "other Monolith icons" will join the Preservation Program, and that "even more news" will be shared regarding the Program tomorrow as well. These are exciting times for game preservation.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what the GOG Preservation Program is, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow">an initiative</a> started by the GOG folks to ensure that certain PC games will always be supported, regardless of whether they're receiving official support from their publishers or not.</p>

<p>Many games have already been added to the program, including titles that have been delisted by their publishers, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft&nbsp;</em>games</a>. Other games that are already part of the project include classics like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dino-crisis-1-2-gog-rerelease" rel="nofollow"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, plus many more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=4wiGnRzs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-dino-crisis.jpg?itok=gSSQcij3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games already bearing the GOG Preservation Program stamp.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Monolith games that might make it to the Preservation Program include the likes of classic FPS&nbsp;<em>Blood</em>, cult shooter <i>The Operative: No One Lives Forever</i>, and, of course, the two&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>sequels.&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&nbsp;</em>is already part of the program, but&nbsp;<em>Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>has yet to be added.</p>

<p>Sadly, Monolith and Player First are just two of the latest casualties in what is somehow becoming an increasingly tumultuous time for the industry. Other studios to close in recent months include NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">Seattle&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>studio</a>, Dr. Disrespect's ex-studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-shutdown-dr-disrespect" rel="nofollow">Midnight Society</a>, and some of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft's studios</a> as well.</p>

<p>If you want to support GOG and its efforts to preserve Monolith's games, you can check out&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R. Platinum&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now via the storefront</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Splitgate 2 Multi-Team Domination Mode And Glacier Map Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In total, there will be three new locations available in the open alpha:</p><ul><li><strong>Glacier (8v8v8)</strong> - This location is 20 times the size of any map from Splitgate and is full of icy slopes that allow players to chain speed from sliding with portal momentum</li><li><strong>Bypass (4v4)</strong> - A vertical map designed for high-flying plays, so you'll want to keep an eye on the sky</li><li><strong>Eden (4v4)</strong> - This map has plenty of portal-walls, as well as a launch-portal that can be used for daring aerial attacks</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">Cross-play</a> will also be supported, and some of the modes that'll be available to try out include Multi-Team Domination--where teams will battle to take control of four zones--and Multi-Team Hotzone, where players will battle it out to take control of a central zone.</p><p>For the new modes, 1047 Games will introduce Splitball and Firecracker to the game. Splitball is a two-team arena mode that combines classic Capture the Flag gameplay with the fast-paced strategy of Halo's Oddball, so teams will need to focus on offense and defense simultaneously. Search-and-Destroy game modes inspire Firecracker, and it involves an attacking team working to deploy the titular firecracker while the defending team attempts to stop them from setting off their fireworks.</p><p>1047 Games added that the open alpha will represent less than half of the content that will be present in Splitgate 2 when it launches later this year on PC and consoles. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

                <p>GOG has announced that it is adding FEAR to its preservation program next month after the game's developer, Monolith Productions, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shut down yesterday</a>. The version being added is the Platinum one, which includes the base game and both expansions. It's on sale right now on GOG for $1.</p><p>While FEAR was already planned to be added to the preservation program, GOG decided to accelerate the process. "Monolith Productions has given players some of the most unforgettable experiences, blending groundbreaking gameplay with rich storytelling," GOG said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. "To honor their legacy, we’re proud to announce that F.E.A.R. Platinum will be joining the GOG Preservation Program."</p><p>There are two other games in the FEAR series, including FEAR 2 and FEAR 3. They haven't been announced as part of GOG's preservation program, but GOG said that other Monolith Production games will eventually join too.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">F.E.A.R.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are reporting that some in-game children now have pregnant bellies, following the game's latest patch.
</p>
<p>
Several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">posts on The Sims' reddit</a> from over the past 24 hours report the issue and provide visual evidence, showing young Sims strutting about with a baby on board.
</p>
<p>
"Umm guys..." one player wrote. "My kid is pregnant..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iy87lc/since_todays_patch_all_the_male_children_in_my/">Wrote another</a>: "Since today's patch all the male children in my game have pregnant bellies." 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">Umm guys… My kid is pregnant…</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FutureApricot8074/">u/FutureApricot8074</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/">thesims</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
It's unclear what new bug has caused the issue, or how widespread the appearance of pregnancy has spread.
</p>
<p>
The bright side here is that these young Sims are only appearing pregnant, rather than actually having their in-game status set to give birth. As far as players can work out, the issue is simply a visual one - though still, bizarre.
</p>
<p>
"I think the overall bug is that they're mixing up adult and child body presets somehow," one player suggested. "One in my save is very muscular suddenly and I saw another one with the classic beer belly and narrow shoulder combo. Really hope they fix it soon."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Sims publisher EA for more detail on what's gone wrong.
</p>
<p>This week's patch for The Sims 4 - the one that seems to have caused this issue - was meant to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">finally add the series' iconic burglar, after 11 years</a>. </p>
<p>Amidst some uncertainty surrounding The Sims' future, the franchise is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary with a range of events, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
