            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-became-a-survival-horror-game-for-one-mission-art-of-the-level<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">For the majority of its runtime, Cyberpunk 2077 is an action-packed RPG. Even if you hone your protagonist, V, into a stealth ninja assassin, the neon-soaked Night City is still frequently the stage for tense combat encounters. That is, however, until Somewhat Damaged, one of the Phantom Liberty expansion’s final quests. Inside a bunker buried deep beneath the city, Cyberpunk 2077 leaves its RPG structure behind and morphs into a survival horror. A relentless robotic hunter stalks you through chambers and corridors, and there’s nothing your weapons can do to stop it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To find out how this level and its terrifying mechanical monster were created, we spoke to staff from developer CD Projekt Red. With their insight, we examine how Somewhat Damaged makes use of logical environment design, increasingly stressful objectives, and resourceful AI scripting to manifest Phantom Liberty’s terrifying crescendo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Liberty tells the story of Song So Mi, better known as Songbird, and Reed, two NUSA agents and former partners. Throughout the campaign it’s revealed that Songbird is on a personal mission to escape the toxic grip of her employer. If you help her, she will save you from your terminal brain virus (AKA Johnny Silverhand) using a Neural Matrix she plans to steal. As the campaign reaches its climax, you’re given a choice: work with Songbird, or betray her and let Reed take her into NUSA custody. Choosing that second option triggers Somewhat Damaged, a terrifying final quest that’s unique to this branch of the story. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-songbird-betrayal-1729593761197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>During the Firestarter mission you can choose to betray Songbird and capture her. This triggers the Somewhat Damaged finale questline. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat Damaged sees a devastated, mentally unstable Songbird flee to Cynosure, an abandoned facility beneath Night City. There she connects with the Blackwall, a defence network that protects the world from unknowable digital horrors, and activates a rogue AI to stalk, hunt, and kill you. Within the dark, decaying corridors of the bunker, all you can do is run and hide. It’s a bold left turn for a game normally so focused on action.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really wanted to do something Eldritch horror,” says Patrick Mills, CD Projekt Red’s former Cyberpunk 2077 loremaster and the person responsible for Somewhat Damaged’s initial design document. “I went to [quest director] Paweł Sasko and I said, ‘Hey, I want to do this. A lot of people aren't going to like this, but I think the people who do are really going to like it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From near enough the very beginning, Mills wanted to create the quest alongside Miles Tost, a senior level designer he knew would be on the same page. Tost immediately agreed to join the project. “I wanted to make something that was way out of my comfort zone,” he says, “and just pushed everything that I knew about working with our engine. We tried to come up with how we could push our technology and our encounter system to create this truly unique experience for the player.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Invincible Beast</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like some kind of restless spirit from beyond the veil, Songbird’s rogue AI possesses a Cerberus. It’s a maintenance robot, but don’t let that basic purpose fool you: this is a relentless, powerful beast. And, unlike any robot you’ve faced in the campaign before this point, it’s completely impervious to damage or hacking. The first thing the development team had to do, then, was to teach players that the Cerberus wasn’t a boss to fight, but a monster to avoid at all costs.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The ideal of a great RPG boss fight is a boss that acknowledges the skills that you've chosen in order to defeat the boss,” says Mills. “But in this case, I went completely against that. None of your abilities are really going to help you here. We just have to disable all of those things because if you give a player the ability to chase the thing off or to disable the thing, if your guns do anything to this thing, that's what players are going to try to do to get through it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We need them to understand the very first time it kills them there's nothing you can do,” he explains. “It's the only way to immediately communicate that idea.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/cp2077-cerberus-render-1728571847624.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The original concept render of the Cerberus maintenance robot. Image credit: Filippo Ubertino / CD Projekt Red.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To put players in the right headspace, the development team carefully designed the path towards the initial Cerberus encounter with a focus on tone. After betraying Songbird in the previous quest, Reed and V attempt to capture her in an explosive raid on a MaxTac convoy. From that point onwards, as V follows Songbird into the bunker, things begin to veer further and further away from the experience you typically expect of Cyberpunk 2077. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I need to make sure as you're moving through this space that there isn't any shooting,” says Mills. “There's as little traditional gameplay as possible. I'm moving you through thematic airlocks, one after the other, to just keep that sense of space between those things. The objective is to make sure that the player understands that it's a different game now.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That different game is, perhaps rather obviously, partially informed by a landmark survival horror. “The Cerberus monster itself came from Alien: Isolation,” reveals Paweł Gąska, who took over quest design duties from Mills. “They nailed this idea of an unpredictable predator that is hunting you on the level and is keeping you tense even when it's absent. We thought ‘This is exactly what we want.’” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Achieving such an experience is easier said than done, though. The entirety of Alien: Isolation revolves around the cat and mouse gameplay between the player and the xenomorph, and so developer Creative Assembly could put significant time and resources into coding its sophisticated artificial intelligence system. CDPR, on the other hand, only needed such a hunter for one single quest… a quest that many players wouldn’t even experience thanks to the branching narrative. And so the team had to find a way to replicate that hunted feeling using craftier techniques. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>From the robot’s perspective, it's never actively actually hunting the player, sorry!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first section of the level, known internally as the outer bunker, is a collection of five rooms linked by a T-shaped corridor. “The game does a check of where V is,” explains Tost. “Is V in this room? No. Okay. Is V in that room? No. Okay. Is V in that room? Yes. And then it basically sends the Cerberus into that room.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a fairly straightforward process, but there are layers to the programming that ensure the robot feels authentically autonomous. For example, there are multiple different patrol paths that the robot can follow. When the system completes its room check and discovers where you are, it randomly assigns one of those paths to the Cerberus. The robot then follows that circuit, which will by design eventually lead it to the room you were discovered in.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From the robot’s perspective, it's never actively actually hunting the player, sorry!” laughs Tost. “It happens to walk within the area that V is in. So that coincides, which is a bit of a problem for V, but really the robot is just on a walk.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/cp2077-cerberus-blueprint-1728571771254.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Blueprints of the Cerberus robot. Image credit: Filippo Ubertino / CD Projekt Red.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be just an illusion, but that doesn’t keep the terror from feeling very real. That result is partly thanks to Tost and the team realising that “the horror really lives in the absence of the robot compared to its presence.” That’s why close attention was paid to the Cerberus’ distinct audio signature. Its six metal legs thud against the flooring with a regular pattern, allowing you to approximate its position even when it’s far out of view. You can hear the whine of its servo motors as it climbs into the air vents that snake around the facility – a signal that the corridors are now free of its presence. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But making this hunter operate as intended was a much more difficult task than making it sound right. Before the final Cerberus was a prototype based on Royce, the cybernetic psychopath from the main Cyberpunk 2077 campaign, but his programming “had the issue of not really understanding when to stop running after you and fighting you,” says Tost. Royce was later replaced with another enemy, the Blood Ritual cyberpsycho, who “was less of what we wanted in the final version, but functionally worked a bit better.” Finally, after a less than ideal length of time, the final Cerberus mesh was given to the design team. “He worked even worse than both [Royce and the cyberpsycho]!” laughs Tost. “He would just glitch in animations. Most of the time he didn’t have animations!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These difficulties almost saw the entire idea of a stalking enemy scrapped. “There were quite a few moments throughout development where we were this [close to] just making it a combat encounter,” Tost reveals. “There was actually a long time where we did have a fight with the robot planned, but we really couldn't get it to work. That basically forced us to really commit to [the hunter idea].”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Haunted Bunker</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Cerberus is an important part of Somewhat Damaged, but avoiding it is not your primary task. Instead, this predator is a constant threat as you attempt to fulfil your main goal of venturing deeper into the Cynosure facility and finding Songbird at its core. Accessing the core first requires opening the colossal bulkhead door that connects the inner and outer bunker, done by disabling four different data terminals: Alpha, Bravo, Sierra, and Victor. Each is located in different rooms around the facility. It’s hardly a scary prospect for a horror-themed level, but a smart shift in how the world is presented makes the simple act of finding computers much more interesting than you’d first expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The belief that I had back then, together with Patrick and the rest of the team, was that in order to really put the player into this horror mindset, we need to get their attention and their eyes on what was happening as much as possible,” says Tost. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-cynosure-map-1729593419861.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The in-game map of Cynosure's outer bunker area. The four dataterms are plotted to help players locate their objectives. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The solution was to eliminate the minimap. When you enter Cynosure, Songbird hacks your GPS link. This removes the distraction from your screen, but also cuts you off from your location data and objective markers. That manifested a whole new challenge – the bunker had to be designed as a space that clearly communicated its pathways through architecture and in-game signage. While the majority of Night City’s geography does adhere to some level of real-world logic, this was a new and unfamiliar approach for Somewhat Damaged. Thankfully, Tost had recently conducted a deep-dive analysis on how immersive sim developer Arkane Studios approaches its best-in-class level design. The findings of that investigation formed the bedrock of Cynosure’s layout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What we came up with was that we gave each room a name, and we put the names very visible on the level,” explains Tost. “We needed to have an in-game map. We needed to have this terminal where you can look at the status of the door and for it to be really, really clear that it has four locks and these locks are linked to these data terminals that you need to get to them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How does the player understand which data terminal is activated and which one isn't and all that? We worked with the UI team in a collaboration and they really helped us with that.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The inner bunker tends to be much more stressful. The rooms are smaller, the spaces are more claustrophobic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This meticulously designed, easy-to-read environment is just one of the components that make this whole level work as intended. The second is the Cerberus and its clever AI behaviour. The final piece comes in the form of objectives. With the Cerberus inflicting so much pressure, the mission’s tasks had to be carefully balanced. They couldn’t ask players to do anything overly-complex. And so opening the bulkhead door is simply a case of activating four data terminals. The resulting challenge is not the terminals themselves, but the tense exploration required to find them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a high stress environment so it's difficult to make complicated decisions,” explains Tost. “So we make the [objective] difficult through the Cerberus being around, but we keep the things themselves simple.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of this is really inspired by other horror games and looking at what they're doing,” Mills reveals. “What is it that you have to do in Soma or Alien: Isolation to progress? Well, the gameplay comes from you're being hunted. You need to go and press this switch and operate this device and when you're doing it, you can't see behind you, and there’s that fear of this thing lurking.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of the objective design was fuelled by the quest’s horror approach, the team still had to ensure that some element of Cyberpunk’s RPG design remained. “Your objective has to give you some chance [against the indestructible Cerberus],” says Gąska. “You are not a passive person here. You are disempowered, you cannot do what you've been doing before, but bits of [your character build] remain. If you invested in the stealth tree, your footsteps will not be as loud, so you have more room to check stuff out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-cerberus-1729604346316.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>There is no way to defeat the Cerberus in combat. Stealth and smarts are your only weapons in this fight for survival.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To allow all players, not just those with high stealth stats, to successfully avoid the Cerberus while exploring the outer bunker, a number of hiding spots were built into the design of each room and corridor. Such areas of cover are signposted through lighting, with flashing bulbs indicating safe havens. “One benefit of having the fixed patrol lines [for the Cerberus] was that I could predict for each patrol point where cover should be to make each and every one of them fair,” says Tost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all four data terminals activated, the door to the inner bunker opens and you can continue your search for Songbird. The next task is to shut down the facility's core, which requires you to sabotage three key systems: the Neural Network, the Datafront’s firewall devices, and the Thermic Control. Similar to the outer bunker, you once again need to cautiously explore the environment to find these objectives, but this time each task involves more risk and danger. With the Cerberus still very much on your tail, the section ratchets up stress and panic levels.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The idea was always to have the outer bunker be the tutorial area, and the [inner bunker] was where we wanted to switch it from just the sheer terror of being in this space to you being confronted by that thing much, much more often,” Tost reveals. “So this section tends to be much more stressful. The rooms are smaller, the spaces are more claustrophobic.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're really forcing the player to interact with the robot in a way that they know will end badly for them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The objectives are no longer just you hooking yourself to the system and shutting it down,” says Gąska. “You have to be more visceral, you have to rip the cables, you have to destroy stuff.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That destruction always, without fail, summons the Cerberus. “We're really forcing the player to interact with the robot and the environment in a way that they know will end badly for them,” says Tost with a smile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all three objectives complete, the facility goes into emergency lockdown, trapping you in the observation room. It makes you a sitting duck for the Cerberus, which of course turns up for one final hunt. Thankfully the room is arranged in a circle, allowing just enough space for you to stay out of the patrolling robot’s vision cone provided you keep moving. It makes for a white-knuckle finale to Night City’s most terrifying game of hide-and-seek. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have this issue of balancing how often the robot should be there,” explains Tost. “In this particular section, which generally is smaller, we had moments where the player would be able to simply speed run it without the robot having any chance to show itself. So the decision was made to just lock the door and you have to endure the robot being in there.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-observation-1729604171139.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The circular design of the Observation Room means you can stay one step ahead of the robot's patrol during the emergency lockdown sequence. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With the objective locked in, Tost settled on using the observation room as the Cerberus’ final hunting ground, as no matter what order you complete the inner bunker objectives, it's always the last room you progress through. To suit the envisioned gameplay, the room was increased in size to create a large, circuit-loop environment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The patrol there is basically just an ‘O’, and what the player needs to do in order to hide is basically either tail him or be ahead of him,” Tost says. “But you can’t stay static.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Successfully avoiding the Cerberus here isn’t the final showdown, though. That comes as you head back to Core Control to shut the system down for good. But rather than an explosive battle, the Cerberus is instead defeated thanks to an emotional heart-to-heart with Songbird. Convinced by your words and worn down by the world, she finally calls off the hunt and powers down the robot.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned by Tost, an early draft of the quest involved a traditional boss battle with the robot. Its temporary inclusion was an admission of defeat – a blip in the design timeline that marks a period when the team just couldn’t get the Cerberus to work correctly. But it wasn’t just the team’s determination to realise their ambition that saw the boss battle wiped from the level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We decided that [defeating the Cerberus in a boss battle] would give you a sense of victory,” says Gąska. “But we don't want you to have that sense of victory. We want you to be in the stage of, ‘Okay, damn, I survived this’ and not ‘I finally killed that bastard.’ And then we let you settle down, and after all this we hit you with the big question at the end.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Final Choice</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Two missions prior, Phantom Liberty serves up the campaign’s biggest choice: will you stand by Songbird, or betray her? During Somewhat Damaged, in the very heart of the Cynosure bunker, you reach the campaign’s most important choice. You betrayed Songbird to get here, but will you stick by your decision? Will you force this devastated woman into the clutches of the people who broke her, or will you allow her one final mercy and end her suffering – knowing full well that if you do, your chance to cure your own terminal illness will be lost forever? It’s a duology of decisions that demanded a huge amount of work to ensure they felt both challenging and satisfying for players to navigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do I help So Mi or do I betray So Mi?” asks Mills. “And if you help So Mi, you learn things that make you doubt your choice. And then in the other path, where you decide to betray So Mi, you're going to learn things that make you doubt your choice. And that's really important because then we offer you another choice at the end of those two paths. Do you regret your decision now? How do you feel about this? So it was really necessary to get So Mi's story in there once we had a better idea of who she was, what her backstory was, and what those dilemmas were going to be.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-flashback-1729593557781.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Songbird's final flashback depicts a birthday party long before she had become a cybernetic weapon. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To reveal the final, vital pieces of Songbird’s story, a series of flashback visions were added to V’s journey through the bunker. Each one shows a key moment of So Mi’s life, pulling the curtain back on her mistakes and misfortunes.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The bunker was a metaphor of going deep into Songbird’s mind,” says Gąska. “But there are two sides of Songbird. One is this caged bird. We wanted to tell you that ‘Okay, she did betray you and all that, but while she's wrong, she was also a victim of circumstances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those circumstances are depicted through each flashback. The first shows Songbird meeting with Phantom Liberty’s villain, Kurt Hansen, during the events of the expansion itself. Each subsequent flashback winds the clock further and further back. “You have her operation, so you see her still without cyberware,” explains Gąska. “You have her oath to Myers, just like you had your oath. You have her first encounter with Reed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then you jump into Brooklyn, where it's an even happier time,” he continues. “This is the core of her identity, her happy place, where she's safe from whatever else was happening in the world. Where she had friends, where she had relationships. Relationships that she herself failed and when it all went down she was forced into this life. We wanted you to have this knowledge because you would soon be choosing what to do with her. If you just see her as this crazy person who betrays you, you will just be antagonistic towards her. You already chose [to hand her over to] Reed once, so there is no reason for you to not choose him again unless we give you additional information.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I'm not that concerned if people are having fun. Am I engaged? That's the important thing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the flashbacks tell a very sympathetic story, CD Projekt Red prides itself on moral ambiguity. Its narrative branches are rarely, if ever, a choice between good and evil. To communicate the two sides of the upcoming choice, the visions of Songbird’s troubled life are delivered while her broken, current-day self is trying to kill you with a deadly robot. “She is an unstable individual that is packed with top cyberware and has an active connection to AIs from beyond Blackwall,” says Gąska. “She is like a cyber nuke in this world, and left alone she's extremely dangerous. If you think that running away from one maintenance robot in one small area of the world was scary, think of what would happen if she hacked the whole of Arasaka headquarters!” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armed with that knowledge, you can make your final decision: will you hand Songbird over to the NUSA, the organisation that ruined her life and turned her into a cybernetic weapon? Or will you grant her wish of death, finally allowing her some peace?  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Killing So Mi felt to me like the mercy option,” says Mills. “Returning her to the people who effectively tortured her should feel gross. It should feel really icky. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/22/cyberpunk2077pl-songbird-choice-1729593638483.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Somewhat Damaged's final choice asks you to kill Songbird. This act of mercy will deny you the cure to the Relic that is slowly erasing your mind. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“She's broken, she's pathetic,” he says. “She is someone who has been tortured. She's been mistreated, and whatever your feelings about her, I want you to feel sympathy. I want you to feel that nobody deserves this. That whatever she's done, that's wrong. This is too much. This is not okay. I want you to really be torn up when you make that decision whether to mercy kill her or give her back to Reed. I want the player to find that place in themselves that has sympathy for broken things.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not that concerned if people are having fun,” Mills admits. “Am I engaged? That's the important thing. Are my emotions being played with? How am I doing it? And I don't want you to feel manipulated either. I want you to just go with it, feel the vibes, go with the vibes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Somewhat Damaged is, arguably, not a very fun mission – at least in the traditional sense of the word. It’s an incredibly stressful experience in which you must face Phantom Liberty’s most terrifying foe using a set of unfamiliar gameplay tools. It forces you to confront one of Cyberpunk’s most depressing storylines and then asks you to permanently pull the plug on one of its best characters. It is, in almost every way, a bad time. And yet that’s what makes it one of CD Projekt Red’s finest ever creations. It is undeniably engaging thanks to its complete commitment to the vision; a vision that jettisons many of the game’s fundamentals in the search for something special. The result is a truly unique mission. This is a horror level through and through. Of course it isn’t meant to be fun. It’s meant to be terrifying. And that’s exactly what Something Damaged is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hbada-e3-office-chair-brings-ergonomic-design-reflective-of-the-company%E2%80%99s-extensive-technological-leadership-and-unmatched-professionalism-in-the-indu.1020069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hbada-e3-office-gaming-chair-brings-ergonomic-design/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When it comes to keeping user comfort and health a priority, <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">HBADA takes the lead</a>, as their commitment to bringing ergonomic design through cutting-edge technology and advanced material is well-known in the industry. Its ongoing efforts in establishing technological leadership and improving ergonomics are attributed to 16 years of experience in finding customer-centric solutions and marking their professionalism and products in the industry. With over 10 million global users, the company definitely doesn’t need any introductions.</p>
<p>All of this intense experience is reflected through its latest HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair, which supports longer sitting durations and is the perfect choice for those looking for a blend of style and comfort.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is designed to promote a healthier lifestyle and is packed with features that make it stand out. Some of its key specs include:</p>
<h3>T-Shape Support System for Better Posture</h3>
<p>The HBADA E3 Office Chair has a T-shaped support structure that is meant to address the three pain points generally experienced during prolonged sitting: waist, neck, and shoulders. This helps in aligning and correcting posture by offering extended support to the lumbar regions.</p>
<h3>3-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support</h3>
<p>When users sit for longer durations, lower back pain seems inevitable, and the industry is continuously working on addressing this issue. HBADA has led in this category with its Three-Zone Elastic Lumbar Support, which can rotate both inward and outward and adjust to all body types and sizes, which can help reduce strain experienced during extensive sitting due to the support that tends to imitate the natural curve of the body.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>4D Headrest with Dual-Axis Neck Pillow</h3>
<p>Not only does it cater to the <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">back issues that 9-5 workers and gamers</a> generally tend to experience during work or gaming, but it also addresses neck pain issues by providing proper support that helps relieve cervical pressure. The dual-axis rotation of 70 degrees and the option to adjust the pillow both vertically and horizontally help distribute the pressure and allow for comprehensive neck support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>6D Mechanical Armrest</h3>
<p>The armrest also offers the option to adjust the seating by adjusting the height, depth, and angles at about six different degrees. This freedom helps reducing the strain on shoulders and maintaining proper posture during work, gaming, or even leisure time by providing elbow and forearm support.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h3>High Elastic Mesh Fabric</h3>
<p>Not only is the option to adjust the armrest and offer lumbar support one of the selling points of the E3 chair, but the material used also makes it truly stand out. The high elastic mesh fabric is breathable and allows for airflow, which helps keep users feeling cool and comfortable, especially during longer periods of sitting. The fabric is easy to maintain and offers durability as it does not easily wear and tear.</p>
<h3>AUTO Gravity-Sensing Chassis</h3>
<p>The best thing about the HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is that there is minimal need to make adjustments manually. The chassis automatically adjusts the recline according to the user's body weight and posture and distributes weight evenly for comfortable sitting. The recline function is extensive, as it can adjust to 140 degrees, making it ideal for supporting full-body rest.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In 2024, HBADA E3 Office Chair was awarded the prestigious French Design Award – Gold Award. The 16 years that HBADA team has served in the industry not only helps it establish itself as a global technology leader but also pushes it to continuously deliver optimal health-driven solutions that actually improve lifestyle. The company also carries a number of certifications, including the German IGR Ergonomics Certification, and also collaborates with the American ICA Chiropractic Association doctors.</p>
<p>Whether you work from home, looking to update your office chairs, or just want a solidly built chair that supports your gaming activity, look no further because the E3 Ergonomic Chair brings it all at an affordable price. The HBADA E3 Ergonomic Office Chair is perfect for an office or home setting, as its ergonomic design helps promote good posture and reduce perpetual strain on the body. Considering the longterm benefits it delivers, this may be the upgrade you need in your life to save your neck and lower back from longterm damage. The E3 comes in 3 color options, including Gray, Black, and Pink. HBADA E3 is available on <a href="https://bit.ly/3A28XE7" rel="sponsored noopener">both the official store</a> and via <a href="https://amzn.to/4dkttNO" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s the trickier of the two clock changing weekends, with time falling back by an hour overnight and in theory giving everyone an extra hour in bed. What’s actually going to happen is that a lot of kids will still wake up at the same time, and pets are going to demand feeding an hour “early” for at least the next fortnight, which is going to see an awful lot of things knocked off shelves and tables by mardy cats.</p>
<p>Great for childless and pet-less gamers, though, who’ve got an extra hour to spend with Black Ops 6, or whatever else tickles their fancy tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Xbox remains committed to "bringing great games to more people on more devices", and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was "a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world", and that "ultimately, [Microsoft's] mission requires that [it] translate technology into empowerment for everyone".</p>

<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem," Nadella said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the CEO also confirmed the company held publishing rights to 20 game franchises that "have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue", and listed six of them. Whilst the recently acquired Call of Duty series is clearly one of them, it was curiously absent from Nadella's list.</p><p>"We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue - from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want.</p>
<p>"Finally, we brought four of our fan-favourite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that Microsoft boss Nadella will earn a wallet-busting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">$79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft earlier this week, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees. 2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the recent launch of a new edition of the <em>Kill Team</em> rules, it's the prefect time to start playing, but what's the best way to get started? The <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set? In this article, we'll take a look at what's inside the box, and see if it's the best way for new <em>Kill Team</em> players to start playing, along with seeing what it has for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the launch box for the current edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review">Operation Hivestorm here</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Set contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Handbook</li>
	<li>Angels of Death kill team (7x Space Marines)</li>
	<li>Plague Marine kill team (7x Death Guard)</li>
	<li>2x Operative Reference Sheets (1 for each kill team)</li>
	<li>Game board and MDF&nbsp;terrain</li>
	<li>Tokens, dice and card-measuring tools</li>
</ul><p>All of the miniatures included in the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set are from the collectible Warhammer Heroes sets. The included Space Maries are those from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-heroes-strike-force-justian-review">Strike Force Justain set we covered</a> for the last edition of <em>Kill Team. </em>All of the miniatures push out from the sprue (no need to cut them) and are push-fit, so they also don't require glue, which makes them perfect for those starting out in the wargaming hobby, as no hobby tools are needed.</p>

<p>The scenery is also beginner friendly, and is push-fit, pre-painted mdf that slots together (and can be reconstructed for easy transport). This, combined with the push-fit miniatures mean that from opening the box to playing can be extremely quick.</p>

<p>The<i>&nbsp;Kill Team </i>Starter Set is the complete package for your introduction to <em>Kill Team</em> and it contains everything you need to start playing. It is very much aimed at the beginner wargamer though and doesn't contain the full rules for <em>Kill Team</em> (we discuss what you need to get next to continue your <em>Kill Team</em> journey below). This means that players of the last edition of <em>Kill Team</em> won't need to pick this up, as the rulebook is a tutorial handbook and the 2 included kill teams can be picked up separately by getting the Warhammer Heroes sets they belong to. But for those new to wargaming or <em>Kill Team</em>, this is the perfect set to get you playing as it contains everything in a single box.</p>

<h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The<i> Kill Team</i> Starter Set contains 2 kill teams, both with miniatures from the Warhammer Heroes lines.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=DJ9o9Tt4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=MeZ5WUMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Angels of Death</h4>

<p>The included Angels of Death kill team is the repackaged Strike Force Justain from the previous edition of <em>Kill Team</em>. The rules for them on the included reference sheet are slightly different from those in the full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, and the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set (we discuss how to take the Angels of Death kill team beyond the Starter Set in the section below).</p>

<p>The Angels of Death kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Space Marine Captain - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and power fist, which can only be blocked with critical success, making it hard for your opponent to avoid damage.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Sergeant - The kill team's second in command armed with a bolt rifle that reduces your opponent's save dice on a critical hit.</li>
	<li>Assault Intersessor Warrior - A close combat specialist armed with a heavy bolt pistol and chainsword.</li>
	<li>Eliminator Sniper - A ranged specialist with 3 fire modes, the accurate executioner, hyperfrag with blast for multiple targets, and the armor-penetrating and high critical hit damage mortis.</li>
	<li>Heavy Intercessor Gunner - Another ranged specialist armed with a high rate of fire heavy bolter.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with auto bolt rifle - The auto bolt rifle has the torrent special rule, which can be used to make additional attacks against all visible enemies within 1 inch of your original target.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with bolt rifle - The standard bolt rifle gets piercing on a critical hit, which makes it harder to enemies to save against.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PihfGyt1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=AKAPrE7P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Plague Marines</h4>

<p>The Plague Marine kill team is a new faction, having not had a dedicated kill team release in the last edition (only in the <em>Kill Team</em> compendium released at the start of the last edition). They currently only have the starter set rules, and not full rules on the Kill Team app (which may change after the release of the Starter Set). As such, the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Plague Marine Champion - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and plague sword, which lets you gain a critical success from a standard success if you didn't roll any critical hits.</li>
	<li>Malignant Plaguecaster - A psychic user with 2 spell options, the short-range entropy with extremely high crit damage, and severe which helps you gain a critical hit, and plague wind, which can roll an attack against every visible enemy within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Bombardier - A grenade-armed Plague Marine, carrying a blight grenade with a 2-inch blast radius, so even enemies that aren't visible or behind cover aren't safe.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Fighter - The fighter only carries a&nbsp;flail of corruption, a close combat weapon, which can only be blocked with critical hits. It has the shock special rule, which makes your opponent discard a success when struck with one of your successes.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Heavy Gunner - Armed with the short-range plague spewer, it can target all visible enemies within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Icon Bearer - Only armed with a short-range bolt pistol and plague knife, the icon they carry means it's easier for them to capture objectives as their APL is considered higher than their stat card.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Warrior - The standard Plague Marine operative comes with a bolter, which has the same stats as the Angels of Death bolt rifle, but without the piercing crit special rule.</li>
</ul><h2>Where Do I Go After The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>Once you've played through the <em>Kill Team</em> tutorials in the Starter Handbook from the Starter Set, you'll be ready to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>. You will be able to initially upgrade to the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules for free, via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/">Kill Team app</a>&nbsp;and you can also download the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules and the full rules for the Angles of Death kill team via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads page</a>. The next stage is to purchase the <em>Kill Team</em> Core Rules and you'll be able to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to use the included kill teams using the full rules, you should note the Angels of Death kill team isn't a legal kill team using the full rules. You can't take both the Space Marine Captain and the Intercessor Sergeant, but you can use the Sergeant as another Intercessor Warrior. You also can't take both the Intercessor Heavy Gunner and Eliminator Sniper in the same kill team, so you will need to add another Assault Intercessor, Intercessor Gunner, or Intercessor Warrior. If you pick up a pack of Intercessors, you will have more than enough to build the options for the different armament options for the Intercessor Warriors and Intercessor Gunners, and a pack of Assault Intercessors (or the cheaper Assault Intercessors and Paint Set) will give you all the options for a full roster.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines currently don't have full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, but I'm hopeful they release them online to coincide with the Starter Set release.</p>

<p>Or if you fancy a different kill team, you can check out the rules for free via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads</a> page and see which of the currently released 33 kill teams that take your fancy, and then pick up the box for them. Some kill teams require 2 boxes to be able to build all the options.</p>

<p>I really like what Games Workshop have done with the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set. It's not an essential purchase for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players unless they don't have the 2 included kill teams from their release as Warhammer Heroes, but it does help onboard new <em>Kill Team</em> players very well. The starter handbook does a good job of taking players through their first few games with 2 very easy-to-pilot kill teams, and it makes it very easy to move into full games. We'll have to see what happens with the Plague Marine rules, but it would have been nice to have an additional Space Marine miniature so that it's a legal kill team out of the box, or at least have made the Angels of Death rules work with this kill team as it is.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>If you're brand new to wargaming, or <em>Kill Team</em>, then this is the perfect place to start. The miniatures are easy to put together, and the handbook does a great job of introducing the rules and setting you up to move into <em>Kill Team</em> lite, and then the full rules. If you're a veteran player, there's nothing extra here other than the miniatures and the new mdf scenery, so if you have them already, you won't need the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set, but if you don't have either kill team, then this may be a cost-effective way to get them.</p>

<p>Operators in the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> are the characters you can play as, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> offers multiple of them. You have the freedom to choose from any of them in the multiplayer mode, however, Zombies has four dedicated to determining a crew and providing story dialogue and context.</p>



<p>Not all of them come unlocked right from the start. Some require you to get the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition while others require you to reach a particular player level. With that said, here are all the Operators in the game and the ways to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-all-operators-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock all Operators in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a total of <strong>21 Operators</strong> present in Black Ops 6 divided between two Factions – Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One. Here’s how you can unlock them:</p>



<h3 id="h-rogue-black-ops">Rogue Black Ops</h3>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>How to unlock</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Russell Adler (Umbra skin)</td><td>Buy Black Ops 6 Vault Editon</td></tr><tr><td>Helen A.

<p>The AS VAL is one of the meta rifles you can use in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> right now. However, to get the best out of the AR, you must use the right attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make it a force to be reckoned with.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-as-val-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AS VAL loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Assault Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting off with the <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong>, this attachment will reduce the horizontal recoil of the weapon, making it easier to control. The base AS VAL comes with only 20 bullets so attaching the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> is crucial to increase its magazine size. Although it will reduce your Sprint to Fire speed a little, The <strong>Assault Grip</strong> will compensate for it well.</p>



<p>Attach the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it enhances Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds. Lastly, use <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> for an additional improvement in recoil control.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-equipment-for-as-val">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AS VAL</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The Perks suggested above allow you to be a stealthy but fatal rifler in-game. <strong>Ghost</strong> perk will leave you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or using Scorestreaks. <strong>Tracker</strong> will let you see enemy footsteps, which is useful for locating and hunting them down.</p>



<p><strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> also leaves you undetected under thermal optics. Using these perks will activate the Recon specialty which lets you see enemies through walls for a short duration.</p>



<p>By the time you unlock the AS VAL, you will also unlock the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wildcard at level 54. Use that to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to improve your normal and Tactical Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment.</p>



<p>Keep the <strong>Semtex</strong> for guaranteed kills while playing Hardpoint or Search and Destroy and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will always come in handy for quick health top-ups. For the Field Upgrade, you can use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-as-val">Best Secondary for AS VAL</h2>



<p>The Stryder .22 and GS45 would be the ideal secondary weapon options for the AS VAL.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-as-val-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The AS VAL unlocks once you <strong>reach player level 55</strong>. This is not the fastest unlock in the game and will take some time, but it’s worth the effort and time you put in.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-as-val-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AS VAL any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the AS VAL is one of the meta Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6 that’s great for combat at all ranges. Although it comes with a higher recoil than most of the other guns in this class, its fast TTK and high mobility easily set it apart from the rest.</p>



<p>Use the attachments suggested above to reduce the recoil significantly and you’ll be good to dominate multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-as-val-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">AMES 85</a> are two of the best alternatives to the AS VAL in BO6. While the XM4 is considered a meta weapon along with the AS VAL right now, the AMES 85 also packs a punch with low recoil and high bullet velocity.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Festival of the Lost 2024 is right around the corner. Arriving a bit later than usual, Halloween's celebration across the solar system promises some interesting surprises, from new masks to a slight rework of the event compared to previous years. If you're wondering what the armor ornaments look like, developer Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shared details</a> about them, too.</p><p>Here's everything you can expect from Festival of the Lost 2024 in Destiny 2, including start times, masks, and the available rewards. We can't guarantee you'll be safe from jumpscares, though.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</a></li><li><a href="#Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</a></li><li><a href="#What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</h2><p>Festival of the Lost 2024 is kicking off after the weekly Destiny 2 reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on October 29. The event comes to an end with the weekly reset on November 12.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894"></a><figcaption>Don't miss Destiny's annual Halloween party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg"></figure><p>It's a bit later compared to last year's edition, which started on October 17, but the scary vibes are the same.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</h2><p>Eva Levante will return to Festival of the Lost. As in previous years, you'll stumble upon her in the Tower. After a quick introductory quest and some candy delivery, you'll be all set to start earning rewards and wearing some cool masks.</p><h2 id="Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</h2><p>If you were used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-farm-spectral-pages-quickly-during-festival-of-the-lost/1100-6518479/" data-ref-id="1100-6518479">farming Spectral Pages</a>, well, that's in the past. Bungie has announced that players no longer need to collect the item to complete chapters of the Book of the Forgotten. You only need Manifested Pages.</p><p>Alongside chests in Haunted Sectors, Manifested Pages will drop from "many different sources while you're wearing a mask," said Bungie. We'll have to wait until the event kicks off to confirm what the developer is referring to, although it's safe to assume it might be related to other activities aside from Haunted Sectors, which will come in handy.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</h2><p>It seems the celebrations around the release of Destiny 2 The Final Shape are still ongoing, as this year's Festival of the Lost is debuting seven new masks. Bungie also mentioned that masks found from Haunted Sectors will roll with higher stats, while the ones from Expert Haunted Sectors will have both high stats and "spikey rolls" with them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893"></a><figcaption>Festival of the Lost 2024 masks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg"></figure><p>Below is the list of masks in Festival of the Lost 2024 (official names TBC):</p><ul><li>Cayde-6 Mask</li><li>Witness Mask</li><li>Tower Staff</li><li>Kadi 55-30 Mask</li><li>Thrall Mask</li><li>Runner Mask</li><li>Nezarec Mask</li><li>Ghost Mask</li></ul><h2 id="What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</h2><p>Alongside the removal of Spectral Pages, there are a few tweaks and additions worth considering before diving into Festival of the Lost 2024.</p><p>Like in previous years, in order to earn Eerie Engrams, Haunted Sectors are your best bet. Keep in mind that you'll be able to grab more Eerie Engrams in Expert Haunted Sectors, as they know have a chance to drop an additional engram.</p><p>In the weapons department, you can expect a familiar lineup of Festival of the Lost guns, only with updated perk pools. Bungie doesn't want to share too many details, except for a few perk combinations as a tease:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechabre (Aggressive Arc Sniper Rifle):</strong> Lone Wolf in column 3, Closing Time in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Green (Rapid-Fire Solar Pulse)</strong>: Loose Change in column 3, Incandescent in column 4, Search Party, Field Tested as origin traits.</li><li><strong>Braytech Werewolf (Precision Kinetic Auto Rifle)</strong>: Rewind Rounds in column 3, Onslaught in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Acosmic (Rapid-Fire Void Grenade Launcher)</strong>: Withering Gaze in column 3, Bait and Switch in column 4, and Search Party, Nadie as the origin traits.</li></ul><p>Also, you're now able to buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva, basically avoiding the need to complete the Dual Destiny quest in Destiny 2. For this, you'll need to own The Final Shape expansion, but know that you won't be able to attune the class items you buy from Eva. Unless you complete Dual Destiny, you'll only get random rolls. But hey, luck might be on your side.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</h2><p>Your candy-gathering efforts won't be for naught, as there'll be quite a few rewards to earn during Destiny 2's Halloween event.</p><p>Below are all of the Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards:</p><ul><li>Wizard Armor Ornaments for a scary vibe.</li><li>The return of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack shader</a>.</li><li>Arcane Embrace as a new weapon: The shotgun has Arc element and a Heavy Burst subtype, so it fires a hard-hitting, two-round burst while slightly reducing flinching from incoming fire while aiming. As teased by Bungie, a potential combo for the weapon is Fourth Times the Charm in column 3, Precision Instrument in column 4, and Search Party in origin trait.</li><li>Lost Memento is also returning as a reward, and you'll be able to hold up to three at a time. You can earn it from completing the Twilight Triumph or as a random drop from focusing any items.</li><li>You can also earn the new Spectral Carapace emblem for completing the Twilight Triumph.</li></ul><p>Have fun in this year's Festival of the Lost!</p>

However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review</a>, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake "stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the first of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes to receive a physical release for PS5, but soon it will have company.

OLED screens offer better contrast ratios and more accurate black levels than LED panels.

Along with the solid gaming performance, the screen sports flicker-free backlighting and low blue light output for less eye strain.</p><p dir="ltr">The rig's CPU is also of note. The Intel Core Ultra 7-155H is part of the brand's new line of premium mobile CPUs that launched earlier this year. This particular model is one of the higher-end chips in the line and offers strong performance and power efficiency, which means better-than-average battery life. In this case, the 14-inch HP Omen Transcend's battery lasts up to roughly 11 hours on a single charge and supports USB-C fast charging, which can restore up to 50% battery life in 30 minutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888"></a><figcaption>14-Inch HP Omen Transcend Gaming Laptop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a bonus, the laptop also comes with three free months of PC Game Pass, which gives you access to tons of games, including almost every Microsoft-published title that's released in the last few years.

But if you're specifically interested in picking up a Call of Duty-themed controller, the most notable new release is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG's new Call of Duty Field Op Edition</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC. This is the latest special-edition variant of Victrix's superb modular controller, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">our favorite third-party gamepad for PS5</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG Field Op Edition</a> is available for $200 at Amazon, but you'll also want to check out last year's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CKH24NK4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midnight Mask Edition</a></strong>, as Amazon has knocked $20 from its price to celebrate the launch of Black Ops 6. If you're interested in the Pro BFG after reading this article, it's worth noting the standard colors of the Pro BFG, white and black, are available for even less right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original black edition is only $145</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CRZ7KFKZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white is $155</a>.

With the included tool, you can quickly remove the faceplates covering the controls and shift the layout around. This allows you to have aligned analog sticks (PlayStation style) or offset (Xbox style). It also comes with four thumbstick caps, four stick grates, and three D-pad styles, including the solid square design shown above as well as more traditional eight- and four-way styles.</p><p>The right analog stick and face buttons can be swapped out for a six-button microswitch fight pad. Naturally, this won't be helpful for Call of Duty, but if you like fighting games, it's a great inclusion. It's worth noting Victrix also released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D7WYPB3V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tekken 8 Edition of the Pro BFG</a> in July.</p><p>The Pro BFG also has four built-in back triggers that can be remapped on the fly and trigger locks for R2 and L2 with five different stopping points. You can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>You can also remap inputs using the Victrix Control Hub on PC. You have more control over your experience with the app, but unfortunately it's only available for PC. That said, adjustments save to the controller, so as long as you have a PC, you can still take advantage of features such as tweaking stick and trigger sensitivity, setting up analog stick dead zones, and adjusting the sound profile. The Pro BFG has built-in audio that gives you in-depth control over your headset audio experience. Keep in mind you'll need to connect your headset to the 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887" data-ratio="1" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887"></a><figcaption>Victrix Pro BFG comes with hot-swappable components</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg"></figure><p>The caveat to opting for a third-party PlayStation 5 controller is that you lose PlayStation's adaptive trigger and haptics tech as well as motion controls. If you're not okay with those losses, the only pro-style controller for you is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's DualSense Edge ($200)</a>. Some PS5 games make the DualSense's unique features a core component of the experience, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astro-Bot-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot</a>--you definitely want to play the PS5's wonderful platformer with a DualSense controller.</p><p>The Pro BFG offers <em>substantially </em>better battery life than DualSense controllers, though. You can get close to 20 hours on a full charge in our experience. And if you want a PlayStation controller with the ergonomics of an Xbox controller, the Pro BFG is the best option.</p><p>It syncs wireless to your PS5, PS4, and PC with a 2.4GHz USB dongle. Alternatively, you use the lengthy, braided USB to USB-C cable for a hardwired connection. All of the Pro BFG's accessories have dedicated slots inside the included hardshell carrying case.</p><p>The Pro BFG is also available in white and black models for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC for $180</a>.

			<p>PlayStation 5 Pro patches for the two games released so far on the base model by Insomniac introduce graphical toggles that allow users to customize their experience further in the vein of PC gaming.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro patches for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both went live today, introduce new Performance Pro and Fidelity Pro modes, which provide, respectively, 60 FPS gameplay with the same image quality of the standard fidelity mode through PSSR and all ray tracing features, and 30 FPS gameplay and new ray tracing features, which can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates when using VRR and 120 Hz Display mode.</p>
<p>The new ray tracing options introduced by the PlayStation 5 Pro Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart patch are RT Reflections and RT Ambient Occlusion, while Marvel's Spider-Man gets RT Key Light Shadows, which uses ray tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps, RT Reflections and Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. More details on the patches and the new options they introduce can be found <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Rift Apart and <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>The two Insomniac-developed games aren't the only ones that received PlayStation 5 Pro patches ahead of the system's release on November 7th. Other games that were already patched include <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-ps5-pro-patch/">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">Alan Wake 2.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-version-1004000-adds-new-graphics-modes-and-ray-tracing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games has published an update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that allows players to take advantage of the graphics and performance options for the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sony developer announced <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the update</u></a>, along with <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a similar update for 2021’s Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</u></a>, on <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1849857089495265401" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media</u></a> today. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch 1.004 is almost entirely focused granting owners of the soon-to-release console additional visual options to ensure they are either swinging through New York City with improved graphics or a higher framerate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/09/09/screenshot-43-1631220042144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Insomniac deploys PS5 Pro updates for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac says that the default will be set to Performance Pro mode, which targets 60fps “while retaining the image quality of the standard Fidelity mode through use of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR).” This is the setting that the team recommends, as it also toggles on all ray-tracing (RT) features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side is the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Insomniac says this is the visual option for those looking to “experiment” with some of the new ray-tracing features offered by the PS5 Pro, which can be tuned to each player’s preference. With Fidelity Pro, you may also notice that pedestrian and traffic density may be increased in a few locations in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, with hair detail also getting a bump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.004 also comes with a trio of new graphical toggles: RT Key Light Shadows, RT Reflections &amp; Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. All three tools are for those who like to tailor their gaming experiences right down to the finest details, though Insomniac warns that you’ll notice changes in certain portions of New York more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect many of the same PS5 Pro enhancements if you check out Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart update 1.005, too, including a default Performance Pro mode and Fidelity Pro mode. This patch also fixes “missing fur wetness” in some of the cinematics that take place on Corson V.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 5 Pro won’t be out for another few weeks, but it’s still caused quite the stir among fans of Sony’s gaming endeavors since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>pulled back the curtain last month</u></a>. The device was revealed to cost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/poll-is-the-playstation-5-pro-too-expensive"><u>a steep $700</u></a>, drawing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock"><u>criticism from those who believe the upgrade isn’t worth the price</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><em>single-player campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wonder how we got here? Not in an existential, “where did we come from?” kind of way, but more specifically “how did a one-off, co-op survival mode in a video game that used to put quotes about the horrors of war on screen when you died turn into <em>this</em>?” 16 years on, it’s hard to reconcile what the original Nazi Zombies mode from 2008’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/12/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review"><u>World at War</u></a> used to be with the outrageous, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/01/resident-evil-6-review"><u>Resident Evil 6</u></a>-inspired campfest I spent several red-eyed hours playing late last night. I’m not saying any of this in a bad way, mind you; Black Ops 6’s take on the mode is thrilling and unique thanks to all new movement mechanics and good map design. Zombies hasn’t been the thing it was in World at War for a while, and I still have a lot more of this year’s version to play before I am ready for my final review, but that one thought has still hit me pretty hard so far: How did we get here, man?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s carve out the bloody guts of this thing, shall we? Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode features two all-new maps: Terminus, a prison complex-turned-bio-research-station, and Liberty Falls, a small town in West Virginia whose slice of quaint Americana is about to test itself against The Worst Day Ever (spoiler: it doesn’t seem to be going well for the Americana). The story itself is a direct sequel to the Zombies campaign in 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-zombies-review"><u>Black Ops Cold War</u></a>, and if you, like me, have largely forgotten what happened in the intervening four years, there doesn’t seem to be much attempt to catch you up. That means you’re going to hear a lot of proper-noun-filled dialogue that <em>could </em>be important or fun references, but instead had me going “I vaguely remember that person,” a little too often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mostly, I wanted the voices in my ear (and the characters I was playing) to shut up. They have what I’m going to call The Modern Video Game Character Problem™, which is to say they all talk too much – especially since half the time they’re just broadcasting their thoughts out loud. I’m not saying each and every one of them is a deeply annoying, terminally unfunny, outrageously unlikeable person, but I’m not <em>not</em> saying that, either. Their mid-combat banter is like something compiled from a Schwarzenegger film penned by ChatGPT – I’m not expecting poetry here, but at least give me Gears of War-level banter, you know? I can only hear lines like the one where someone is complaining about how the zombies make them so mad they “boil their piss” or how we need a mop to clean up all the brains we’re splattering everywhere so many times before I want to turn my gun towards my allies instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the story is a mixed bag so far, but you know what isn’t? The gameplay. The biggest change here is Omnimovement (Zombiemovement?), Black Ops 6’s complete overhaul of Call of Duty’s basic movement mechanics. You can sprint, slide, and dive in every direction, even chaining these moves together. You’ve also got a full 360 degrees of motion, which means you can do sick stuff like sprint backwards, pull off a retreating dive, mow down the zombies approaching you from every angle, and then get up and keep moving before they even get close. We haven’t seen zombie-killing moves like this since Resident Evil 6, minus a few suplexes here and there. (Dear Treyarch, please add suplexes. Love, Will.) Even if Treyarch misses what might be the easiest post-launch, patch-introduced layup with that, though, the point I’m making is that this <em>feels good</em>, and I like it. I like it a lot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story may be a mixed bag so far, but the gameplay feels <em>good</em>.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like the maps themselves. I think I prefer Liberty Falls over Terminus so far because I dig its height, with extremely entertaining ziplines that let you zoom from roof to roof. I also enjoy its more traditional structure of “pay Essence to open doors and access new places” over Terminus’s “restore power to the generators and defend them from zombies so you can earn the ability to open doors” twist, but that’s not to say Terminus doesn’t do anything cool. At one point, I found a little outboard-powered raft that allowed me to venture to the smaller islands around the main area. I died pretty promptly, because when I landed on a beach a horde of zombies popped out of the ground like a bunch of really angry, undead cabbages, but c’est la vie, right? C’est la undead? I don’t speak French.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a bit more mixed on the way the maps handle progression through the story. Based on what I’ve played so far, you don’t really do much “defending” in Black Ops 6’s version of zombies. Instead, you’re constantly moving, unlocking new areas and trying to complete that map’s Main Quest during rounds. You can pretty much do this however you want. In my experience, that means a lot of running for your life and trying to earn enough Essence (which you get from offing zombies) to open the way to the next area, buy a new weapon, or upgrade a gun you like at a Pack-a-Punch Machine, which does exactly what it sounds like. Treyarch plans on providing an optional, more guided, story-focused version of the mode later on to preserve the sanctity of the Easter Egg hunt (whatever that means) – that will disable Easter Eggs and Side Quests, but I kind of wish it was here now so I could see the difference it makes. These maps are really big, and as someone with an absolutely terrible sense of direction, I’d just like to get a feel for where I’m <em>supposed </em>to go and how to get there before I focus on optional stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I really don’t like, at least so far, is the meta-progression. You don’t unlock the ability to make your own loadouts until you hit level four, and even then, you probably haven’t unlocked anything fun to customize on any of the guns you have yet. What’s more, progression feels painfully slow; I hit level four after an hour and a half of game time, which feels too long to wait for that basic functionality. I’ve only played by myself as of now, which I’m sure has slowed me down, but the delay still doesn’t feel great. What’s more, the lack of customization in the early going made my runs (two on Liberty Falls, one on Terminus) feel samey in a way I didn’t like. Hopefully, playing with friends will solve this problem, but it’s something I’m wary of as I continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot I haven’t touched on yet, like in-map progression and upgrades (my early impression is actually “there might be too many mechanics here”), so I want to spend more time with this year’s Zombies mode before I finalize this review and put a score on it sometime next week. For right now, I’m excited to play more, and still kind of in awe at how we got here. Undeath sure is strange, huh soldier?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As Cities: Skyline 2 continues its attempts to recover from last year's disastrous launch, Paradox Interactive has announced and released a fresh batch of paid DLC for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>, some 18 months after delivering what was supposed to be its final major update.
</p>
<p>
Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-reveals-details-of-final-cities-skylines-dlc">concluded Cities: Skylines 1's release roadmap</a> in May last year with the launch of its final mini-expansion, Hotels &amp; Retreats. At the time, it said developer Colossal Order would continue general support through to the end of 2023 as it shifted its focus to Cities: Skylines 2.
</p>
<p>
But Cities: Skylines 2's launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">went poorly</a>, resulting in multiple delays to Paradox's post-launch DLC plans while Colossal Order continued to improve the base game. An early attempt to foist DLC on the Cities: Skylines 2 player base was so badly received, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">vowed to postpone</a> all future paid DLC "indefinitely". Then, in September, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced further DLC delays</a> so Colossal Order could complete work on a "crucial" assets editor.

<p>
And now, amid a string of other major misfires for Paradox, the publisher has decided to return to a well most assumed had finally run dry. 18 months after wrapping up support for Cities: Skylines 1, it's launched three new paid DLC packs for the game, all themed around mountain peaks and alpine terrain. There's the Mountain Village Pack and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEzJ2wmUPYQ">Map Pack 3</a>, both part of Cities: Skylines' Content Creator range, plus the Radio Station Alpine Tunes music pack.
</p><p>
"This content has been in the works for some time as we know many of you still love building and expanding your cities in the original Cities: Skylines," Paradox wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651?l=english">DLC announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines 2 for this," it continued, noting the new DLC has been created in partnership with developer Tantalus. "Our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines 2."
</p>
<p>
All three new Cities: Skylines 1 DLC releases are available now on PC, and arrive ahead of <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">eight free community created region packs</a> inspired by the architecture of iconic cities around the world that'll launch for Cities: Skylines 2 starting next week.
</p>
<p>
All this comes at a challenging time for Paradox, which has faced a string of high-profile set-backs over the last few years. Alongside Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch, Prison Architect 2 has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">delayed indefinitely</a> after Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">split with developer Double Eleven</a> earlier this year, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> (which was almost cancelled before The Chinese Room <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">took over its troubled development</a>) recently saw its release pushed back from "late 2024" into 2025. That's on top of Paradox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">decision to cancel promising life sim Life By You</a> in June, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, which resulted in Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer about the company's troubles earlier this year, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a>, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change."
