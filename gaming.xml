            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cal Kestis, the hero of EA's Star Wars Jedi video games, will appear in a spin-off TV series — marking his first voiced appearance in another medium. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The redheaded Jedi will play a role in new episodes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/lego-star-wars-rebuild-the-galaxy">Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy</a> set to debut on streaming service Disney+ next month. A non-canon spin-off set in a "What If?"-style remixed Star Wars universe, Rebuild the Galaxy previously introduced the world to Darth Jar-Jar. Who knows what this second round of episodes will see Kestis (or an alternate universe version of him) get up to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, Kestis will once again be voiced by Cameron Monaghan, in the actor's first voice role as Kestis outside of a video game. News of Monaghan's return, as well as Kestis' appearance on a poster for the series, come amid fan speculation the Jedi may eventually turn up in live-action form — something Monaghan himself has said he is open to. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Monaghan has said he would "absolutely" want to portray Kestis in live-action, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-actor-explains-conditions-under-which-hed-play-cal-kestis-in-a-live-action-project">the actor has also said the project would "have to be right" for the character</a>. "By that I mean, it has to continue the story or the character in some way," Monagahan said in March 2024. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't want him to just kind of show up to stand around and be there. I want him to mean something and for there to be a significance for the character itself. So, it would have to make sense. But in the right context then, yeah, absolutely."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kestis' appearance in Rebuild the Galaxy marks the latest appearance of his popular character outside of Respawn's Jedi series, alongside other elements from the games. Kestis already has a spin-off novel, Jedi: Battle Scars, and popped up in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, a smartphone game also published by EA.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/mv5bnjgxyzc5ntgtyzvkms00zgjlltgyn2utngrmntk5njq3yzrjxkeyxkfqcgc-v1-1755269445515.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kestis features on the Rebuild the Galaxy Disney+ poster, alongside Mando, C-3PO and Princess Amidala.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time, various elements from the Star Wars: Jedi series have popped up elsewhere. A droid of the same model as Kestis' loyal companion BD-1 is featured in Episode 5 of The Book of Boba Fett (you can also buy the droid as a LEGO set), while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Season 1 of Ahsoka</a> saw the titular Jedi use psychometry. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2020/01/07/canon-force-powers-star-wars-healing">This rare force ability allows Jedi to detect echoes of the past by interacting with objects or locations</a>, and was taken by some as an indication that Ashoka had encountered Kestis at some point in her past.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this just Disney having fun with its vast cast of Star Wars characters, a reminder there's still a third Star Wars: Jedi game from Respawn on the way, or a tease that fans can expect yet more from Kestis (and Monaghan) in future? Time will tell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Rebuild the Galaxy launches via Disney+ on September 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/billycupid.bsky.social/post/3lwgzrytslc2d">billycupid</a> on Bluesky, there's no Switch logo on the spine of the first volume, while the second lacks a full-stop after 'Vol' – something which <em>is</em> present on Vol 1.</p>
<p>"Come on guys, get your act together," says the social media poster. "People are going to start thinking you’ve just shat out a couple of half-baked collections on the cheap."</p>
<p>Clear River isn't alone when it comes to this kind of mistake – it can happen to the best of us, as Capcom found out with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a> (which had the IGN logo on its cover) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/01/north_american_resident_evil_packaging_is_wrong">Resident Evil Revelations</a> (which got the spelling of the game's name wrong).</p>

			<p>Gamescom 2025 is only days away from kicking off at the time of this writing, which also means we're only days away from Gamescom Opening Night Live, the presentation hosted by Geoff Keighley that starts the annual convention every year with a bevy of announcements and trailers for upcoming titles.</p>



<p>While Keighley would never spill all the beans regarding what will be at the showcase, he has highlighted a few of the games that we already know will be there, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-open-levels-capcom-worked-improve-performance/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-a-similar-sized-map-to-tsushima-but-it-has-been-designed-to-feel-larger/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2025-hollow-knight-silksong-rog-xbox-ally/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>We'll also get a look at the upcoming season of the Fallout TV show, which has its second season set to premiere sometime in December 2025, though a specific release date has yet to be announced.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Games confirmed for <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> ONL on Tuesday:</p><p>- Call of Duty: Black Ops 7<br>- Resident Evil Requiem<br>- Ghost of Yotei<br>- Ninja Gaiden 4<br>- The Outer Worlds 2<br>- Silent Hill f<br>- World of Warcraft: Midnight<br>+ More</p><p>Plus Fallout Season 2 +  Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 music performance. <a href="https://t.co/6211OvsL5W">pic.twitter.com/6211OvsL5W</a></p></div>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1956355195287323133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Beyond what Keighley's mentioned here, we also know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-gamescom-2025/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be featured at Gamescom 2025, and will potentially, finally, get its release date announced after what's felt like an extremely long wait for any concrete news on the game's release.</p>



<p>Just prior to the publication of this post, a rumor from Billbil-kun at Dealabs surfaced, claiming that Sony will announce a new Inzone headset, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-h9-ii-headset-reveal-at-gamescom-2025-onl/">Inzone H9 II</a>.</p>



<p>Attendees at the convention will also get to go hands-on with the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, which should also have its release date revealed during the Opening Night Live presentation, as well. Pearl Abyss' <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">Crimson Desert will again be at this year's show</a>, after the game was recently delayed out of 2025.</p>



<p>As far as what won't be there, Embark Studios has come out to say that it won't be taking part in the festivities with its upcoming shooter, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-another-playtest-before-launch-embark-studios/">ARC Raiders</a>, but beyond that, we'll have to wait and see what doesn't make an appearance during ONL to know who decided to skip out on the event.</p>



<p>You'll be able to watch the approximately two-hour presentation live on YouTube and other major platforms when it premieres on Tuesday, August 19, at 11 am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST.</p>

              <p><em>Roblox</em> is possibly the most popular gaming platform on the planet—far more popular than you might think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"><em>Grow a Garden</em></a>, a game built within the app, recently had 21.9 million concurrent players, dwarfing the likes of <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>by multiple times. And that’s despite being an application recently described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">“a pedophile hellscape for kids.”</a> Well, it can now add another similar accolade to its collection, as the entire state of Louisiana has announced it’s suing&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, calling it “a breeding ground for sex predators.”</p> <p>Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill announced the action via X, explaining that she’s coming after the gaming platform due to its “lack of safety protocols,” and the claim that this results in danger for children. Which, in most circumstances, might come across as all-too-familiar hyperbole from a member of government looking for a moral panic to latch onto. It’s just, in the case of <em>Roblox</em>, it’s something that’s been demonstrated to be true <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-shocking-just-how-shady-roblox-actually-is-1847522070">over</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">over again</a>. But no matter the accuracy, the question remains: What is the actual, practical purpose of this suit?</p> <p>“<em>Roblox</em> is overrun with harmful content and child predators,” says Murrill, “because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by <em>Roblox</em> so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 BREAKING: Today I’m suing Roblox – the #1 gaming site for children and teens – and a breeding ground for sex predators.</p> <p>Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators… <a href="https://t.co/p98Sq8vvMb">pic.twitter.com/p98Sq8vvMb</a></p> <p>— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956081394083409932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">The longer statement</a> goes on to describe the motivation behind the suit.</p> <blockquote><p>“Because there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign-up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age – allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement.</p> <p>Once registered, users have access to millions of games such as sports, role-playing, naval, fashion, and comedy. Other games which have existed on the platform including Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party, and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe are not as innocent. These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape.”</p></blockquote> <p>Again, every muscle in my body wants to type out why this Republican AG is wrong and how she’s willfully misinterpreting the facts to condemn a topic she doesn’t understand…but, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">I’ve tested it all for myself</a>, and it’s true. You can absolutely sign up as being any age up to 17 without any verification requirements, and passing as over 17 isn’t a herculean effort. But there’s little need, since many of the violent and sexual games are simply marked as suitable for teens so there’s no restrictions to playing them. Oh, and despite my own son not being allowed to use <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(I am the&nbsp;<em>meanest</em> father), his friends do and so I get to hear about “Diddy Party” and the like far more often than anyone could want.</p> <p>Changes were made toward the end of 2024 that added new options for parents, allowing them to prevent their under-13s from being able to use in-game chat features, and that stopped children under 9 from accessing teenage content. However, it’s more extraordinary that even these most basic levels of protection hadn’t been included for the app’s first 18 years. And even in the wake of these changes, there’s still nothing to stop a 13-year-old from accessing very adult content or having un-monitored text communication with anyone. (As a parent of a 10-year-old who plays <em>Gorilla Tag</em> on his VR, I’m acutely aware how much more pernicious text chat is than audio.)</p> <p>Teenage privacy and online communication is a massively fraught and complex subject, one for each family to wrestle with among themselves, but it remains the case that <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">investigations into&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> have found groups “openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors,” even when signed in using under-13 accounts.</p> <p>Now, obviously the vast majority of the 80 million people who play&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> every day are fine, even if they’re having their precious youths wasted on <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Italian Brainrot memes</a>. I think what most people are after is just more effort on the parts of the owners to better protect young users from the <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/04/17/man-accused-kidnapping-10-year-old-he-met-roblox-discord/">very obvious harms that are possible</a>. Although given some of <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">the awful things those owners are wont to say</a>, hopes for common sense aren’t high.</p> <p>It’ll be interesting to see what this peculiar lawsuit is intended to achieve. It seems more like attention-seeking noise than anything practical. The article cites the same Hindenburg Research investigation we’ve linked above, and then mentions a recent case in Livingston Parish where a home was raided after someone was trying to lure children via <em>Roblox </em>(we haven’t been able to verify this, and even <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Files/Article/322/Documents/RobloxLawsuit.pdf">the text of the official lawsuit</a> doesn’t cite any evidence), before stating, “For these and other reasons,&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is in violation of Louisiana law.”</p> <p>Which laws?</p> <p>“The State is seeking permanent injunctive relief and prohibiting them from:</p> <ul> <li>Engaging in any activity in violation of Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act:</li> <li>Representing that Roblox has adequate safety features</li> <li>Restitution to the State of Louisiana</li> <li>Attorney’s fees</li> <li>All additional civil penalties allowable under law</li> <li>All additional damages allowable under law”</li> </ul> <p>Presumably there’s a hope that this will force Roblox, the company, to take its responsibilities more seriously, given it cannot control its distribution on a state-by-state level. However, it seems more likely the kerjillion-dollar company will just settle to make it all go away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has uncovered that GTA 5 had a climbing feature that was tested and scrapped before launch. </p>



<p>Players have been eagerly awaiting more GTA 6 news since the game’s release date was announced, set for May 26, 2026. However, all we have learned since the last trailer is that the upcoming title will feature a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fair-price-80-dollars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fair price</a>“. However, until we see some gameplay for GTA 6, players can read about new details on GTA 5’s scrapped features that have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-had-a-feature-called-handholds-which-was-tested-and-scrapped">GTA 5 Had a Feature Called ‘Handholds’, Which Was Tested and Scrapped </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/gta-5-climbing-parkour-gameplay-feature-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, the new details about GTA 5’s cancelled climbing feature come from Lucas7yoshi_RS on <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956065169005510657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). It seems that developers were testing a feature called “Handholds,” which was used to define “climbable” objects in the game. These included pipes, walls, poles, and more. The dataminer found a file called “handholds.xml”, but the file only contains test points. </p>



<p>The dataminer also points out a recent video from GTA content creator, whatever57010, which highlights “some oddly placed lightpoles”. The dataminer notes that several test points were also discovered near the same roof as the light poles. Moreover, the poles might have been there to test the climbing features; however, the GTA 5 developer may have forgotten to remove them afterward. Interested readers can check out these test points in the post embedded below: </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Years before release an idea was tested and scrapped in GTA 5 called "Handholds".<br>It was some sort of way to define climbable things like pipes, walls, that might've required pressing buttons for each point.<br>A handholds.xml file is left over, but contains only test points. <a href="https://t.co/LrgmXEzxme">pic.twitter.com/LrgmXEzxme</a></p>— Lucas7yoshi_RS – Lucas7yoshi, but rockstar (@Lucas7yoshi_RS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956065169005510657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h2 id="h-gta-5-npc-behaviour-detailed-in-game-files">GTA 5 NPC Behaviour Detailed in Game Files </h2>



<p>While scouring through the files, the dataminer also found <a href="https://x.com/Lucas7yoshi_RS/status/1956135971965296873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">references</a> to NPC behaviour in GTA 5. For example, homeless NPCs would insult and ask for change from Michael and Franklin, but would only greet Trevor with a simple ‘hi’. Similarly, buff NPCs would insult Michael, calling him unfit, whereas Franklin would get a ‘hi’ from them. Moreover, firemen, medics, and posh NPCs only say hi to Michael. </p>



<p>In other news, GTA’s longest-serving actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lazlow-doubt-gta-6-longest-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubts</a> he will be a part of GTA 6. Also, GTA Online will soon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require age verification</a> to play, according to a new claim. What are your thoughts on GTA 5 developers testing and scrapping the climbing feature? Do you think the feature can be included in GTA 6? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>In case you somehow missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is taking the world by storm right now. The upcoming EA shooter is currently on its second early beta, having only last week brought in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">concurrent player counts of over 400k on Steam alone</a>.</p>
<p>As such, Battlefield 6 is currently pointing at the stands bat in hand, lining up an absolutely scorcher of a launch in October. Early indications of just how successful Battlefield 6 will be are hard to parse, but video game analytics company Alinea Analytics stated that the game <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315">had 605k Steam pre-orders as of 12th August</a>, based on its research.</p>
<p>That's certainly an eye-watering number, so to learn about Battlefield 6's momentum, as well as its impact on the wider FPS space and more, Eurogamer sat down with a chat with Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics to dive into Battlefield 6's initial success, and whether the game can stick the landing.</p>

<p><strong>Eurogamer: How did you reach the 600k Steam pre-order figure, and where does that stand against the performance of prior Battlefield games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rhys Elliot</strong>: "So I can't give specifics on our methodology, but Steam scrapers, a panel of gamers that take info from. Current figures are at 800k copies through pre-order, revenues of $40m. Far above previous installments and other shooters.</p>
<p>"This is a welcome turnaround for the franchise. I'll not say it's been on shaky ground as prior games have sold well, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> and Battlefield 5 have been a bit of a letdown for the community, a look at critical reception or places like Reddit show its been a little bit of a fall from grace for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>,4, Bad company etc.</p><p>"It's an important time too as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC</a> - formerly FIFA - which still is EA's cash cow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">has a bit of a shaky revenue long tail this year</a>. So there's a lot riding on Battlefield this year as there's some uncertainty around FC this time around."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Where would you expect to see that pre-order number hit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "I think it'll pass a million in pre-sales. It depends on the marketing campaign up until launch, we've still got two months until its release which is a long time. The second beta is ongoing, and the jury is still out ahead of the weekend which are the biggest days by-engagement on Steam. But if we look at the Steam concurrents on Thursday the 7th August, that was like 335k concurrent on Steam. Yesterday, it was 407k which is an improvement.</p>
<p>"So it depends on whether EA can continue that marketing momentum heading into September. There's a lot going on in September on the shooter front, you've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> coming out, a lot of other games… It's quite quiet now in terms of releases, so there's a lot of room for Battlefield to breathe. As we head into the Autumn period there'll be a lot more going on, but as of right now it's on track to do extremely well: the best Battlefield has ever done."</p>

<figcaption>Battlefield 6 is certainly in the zeitgeist right now, but can it stay in the spotlight? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Reports earlier this year stated that there's </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller"><strong>an internal goal for 100m lifetime players</strong></a><strong>, a large part of that assumedly tied to the free battle royale mode. Do you think the game could hit that goal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "I think it's completely unrealistic, to be candid. These are leaks right, they're unconfirmed. But those figures are around Fortnite territory. Battlefield 6 is a paid game, and yes there is a free battle royale mode, so maybe that's the ceiling that they are aiming for. But I don't think that will happen. Battlefield is Battlefield. It's not niche, but it doesn't have that mass appeal that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Call of Duty</a>. 100m is a wild audience number."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Former Blizzard head Mike Ybarra said that Battlefield will stomp Call of Duty this year. Do you think he's right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: It's not going to. Mike Ybarra has had some choice takes on Twitter recently, I think he's been saying things like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> not having a good value proposition, that gamers should tip publishers during economic crises. I think a lot of news outlets will run with Mike's opinions because of what he used to do on Blizzard, but he's just a dude, right? He's just a dude on Twitter.</p><p>"I think it's important not to conflate Battlefield's pre-launch success - even if it will be a big success - with being a 'CoD Killer'. Yes, Battlefield 6 is making all the right moves with these massive maps, a return to the core classes, the destruction. It is also borrowing a lot of things from CoD. Call of Duty is in a bit of a creative lul and an identity crisis, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">with Nikki Minaj shooting Beavis and Butthead while Snoop Dogg is twerking in the background</a>. It's weird! But it's still a cultural juggernaut, it has a massive casual audience who buy it on autopilot every year. They complain, but they still buy it, and those habits run deep.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>You've got to feel somewhat bad for Mrs Minaj, who has become the face of Call of Duty's identity problem. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Activision</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly winning over the hardcore FPS crowd, but CoD has that market momentum, the yearly launches, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> is there as that big pool for cross pollination marketing and a funnel into Black Ops. CoD has the seasonal content treadmill it's been running for years and years, with streamer partnerships. Whether Battlefield can keep up with that is unclear.</p>
<p>"We've always heard over the years: 'this Battlefield is going to beat CoD'. We heard it with 2042, it never happens. Even with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, which was a return to form for many, while CoD had Infinite Warfare. I liked that personally, it got panned by a lot of people. Even then, CoD completely wrecked Battlefield, and that's because of the brand inertia.</p><p>"This <em>could</em> - and that's a big could - be a turning point in which a few years down the line the tides could shift, but saying that Battlefield is going to boot stomp CoD in terms of sales and mind share is a bit of a wild thing to say."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: EA has held back on increasing the prices of their games, and </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-may-not-be-80-after-all-as-ea-shuns-higher-priced-games-for-now"><strong>Battlefield 6 is still selling at the $70 price point</strong></a><strong>. How important has this stance been for the pre-order numbers we're seeing, and how damaging could an $80 base price point have been?</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The Outer Worlds 2 recently went back to the $70 price point, in a bold u-turn by Microsoft. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Obsidian</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "I think the shock of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">the extra $10 for a lot of gamers will be a bit too much</a>. But with Battlefield and a lot of games, you've got the Ultimate Edition or Collectors Edition which costs $90 or $120. The super fans who can afford it usually do due to early access and other fans, and most usually do in the pre-order phases.</p><p>"Charging that extra $10 would close the door on some gamers, and as this is a year when it wants to make a big comeback, throwing the needle over to that sticker shock would have been a bad idea. I think in general, the jump from 70 to 80 is a lot, you're closer to $100 than $50 at that point, and psychologically that's a big step for consumers. Especially right now.</p>
<p>"People will pay it for GTA, and super fans will pay it for any game they're interested in so publishers can have it both ways as long as they keep that lower floor price. Eventually, the RRP (recommended retail price) will go up for games - that's inevitable. But for now, $70 is the sweet spot with some variable pricing for big hitters like the next Zelda or GTA. Though even GTA is a maybe, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-take-two-ceo-price-80-ps5-2000616607">based on Zelnicks' comments</a>."</p>

<p>Here's some further details from the press release:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sony-inzone-h9-ii-une-nouvelle-version-du-casque-gaming-sans-fil-arrive-bientot-60393">Billbil-kun on Dealabs</a>, Sony is set to reveal a new headset in its Inzone lineup of accessories at Gamescom 2025, with the Inzone H9 II, the successor to 2022's Inzone H9, potentially being announced during Gamescom 2025's ONL Showcase.</p>



<p>The Inzone line of accessories was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-inzone-pc-gaming-monitors-headsets-accessories-evo-2022/">first launched in 2022,</a> with Sony releasing headphones and monitors and then showcasing them during EVO 2022. We've already had a follow-up release of monitors, with Sony releasing OLED variants of its Inzone monitor line.</p>



<p>Dealabs also includes a spec chart for the new rumored H9 II headphones, which shows a few significant changes like the new model having a detachable mic, support for the latest Bluetooth standard, and weighing far less than the original H9 headphones.</p>

<p>As far as price is concerned, Dealabs reports that the H9 II headphones will set you back <strong>€349.99</strong>, with pre-orders set to go live when its revealed during Gamescom ONL. Dealabs doesn't include a specific release date prediction, but does suggest that it'll be out sometime in early September.</p>



<p>While it's important to remember that all of this information is, at the time of this writing, not verified and still a rumor, Billbil-kun and Dealabs have built a strong reputation for accurately reporting retail information ahead of official announcements.</p>



<p>We'll know by this time next week if their reputation continues to be just as strong.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Update Seemingly Censors Game and Angers Fans]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-15-censorship</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-seemingly-censors-game-and-angers-fans.1271181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>are flocking to Steam to leave negative reviews owing to what appears to be an attempt at censoring some of the game's content in its latest update.</p>

<p>As noted by none other than Soulslike aficionado and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>modder</a> Lance McDonald on <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1955675217680105798" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-broken-by-a-push-to-censorship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Update 1.5, which was released recently, changes the game so that it's impossible to "kill any historically significant bosses or NPCs".</p>

<p>Instead, according to McDonald, these enemies and bosses simply "get 'exhausted' and relax after the fight and talk to you". It also seems as though a Pray emote, taught to the player by a Portuguese Christian missionary during the course of the game, has been removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=ZQO3C6gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=pUjKBB7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>update is provoking ire amongst the game's community.</figcaption></figure><p>According to McDonald,&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' fourth chapter is now "insanely easy" because half of the chapter's enemies will no longer attack you, and you also can't attack them, so a vast portion of that chapter's challenge has been removed.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game's protagonist now also apparently pledges to "continue [the] legacy" of bosses she defeats, which, as McDonald notes, "literally ruin[s] the entire point of the game's plot about impermanence".</p>

<p>There are many more examples of these kinds of changes throughout McDonald's social media thread, and I'd recommend reading it if you want to know what's different after the update.</p>

<p>The official patch notes themselves don't really make reference to these changes, either; there's a brief note about adding "dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots" and "further optimiz[ing] the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance", but nothing concrete.</p>




<p>Needless to say, these changes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">haven't exactly thrilled</a> Steam users, with many leaving negative reviews decrying&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"sudden"</a> plot changes, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/saint-in-chief/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"censorship"</a>, and attempts to appease <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030735475/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"whiny Chinese nationalists"</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, those complaints now appear to have overtaken the very "nationalist" ire the update was seemingly intended to address. Whether or not Leenzee will make further changes remains to be seen, but it does seem as though&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>has been significantly changed through Update 1.5.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to check out the game, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9NPRHD8GQKQS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as a Game Pass title.

The first gameplay was revealed to content creators and critics ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where it became clear developer Game Freak is unafraid <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-trailer-mega-evolution-az-1851766880">to change-up some decades-old formulas</a>.</p> <p>The demos were brief, split between 10 minutes of regular trainer battles and 10 minutes of a raid-like encounter against a Mega Evolution Abso. Unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-tone-nintendo-swit-1848478468">in 2022’s<em> Arceus</em></a>, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has you move around a battle in real-time, telling your Pokémon which moves to use or when to get out of the way at will. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/"><em>VGC</em> noted</a> that you can even sneak up on enemy trainers to get an advantage in battle, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>The Verge</em> compared</a> the Mega Evolution showdown to “a classic 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>boss.” Your trainer can even take damage herself during these battles.</p> <p>You can see what they’re describing in some of the hands-on footage from <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii <em>Pokémon</em> expert</a> Joe Merrick:</p>

This lets you use any attack an unlimited number of times, but only once its meter is full. “<em>Legends: Z-A</em> didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening,” writes Casey DeFreitas.</p> <p>Like everyone else, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-trying-out-real-time-and-mega-evolution-fights/"><em>CNET</em> demoed</a> the game on <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">Switch 2 in docked mode</a> and noticed “no performance hiccups.” Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-with-overhauled-battles-and-denser-exploration-im-shocked-at-how-fundamentally-fresh-this-could-feel/"><em>Gamesradar</em> was</a> underwhelmed by the urban playground <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>&nbsp; takes place in “The streets and rooftops are bare and lack personality and, while appearing to be a bustling metropolis, Lumiose City is strangely quiet. The limited character animations are also quite noticeable,” writes Michael Leri. “It does make me wonder if the game is underwhelming in these areas because<em> Z-A</em> is still chained to the archaic original Switch compared to its more powerful successor.”</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> might still be visually hemmed in by the franchise’s history, it sounds like the city’s map still shows it being densely packed with points of interest. Combined with reworked moves to cater to the real-time flow of combat and mechanics like collecting orbs of energy in fights to trigger your own Pokémon’s Mega Evolutions, it feels like at the very least, this year’s release, the first new one in three years, is taking some fresh risks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Once more unto the breach. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, and more, is here. This morning we’re looking at a second screen for the Switch 2 and a wider Steam, we’ve got good news about that new <em>Mafia</em> game, and the devs behind<em> Battlefield 6</em> are making some changes to the beta. Oh, and don’t worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspBUfY8IKs">we’re getting a new video game based on <em>Chicken Run</em></a>. I know everyone was waiting for that.</p> <h2><strong>Rush in the <em>BF6</em> open beta isn’t a great experience</strong></h2> <p>The<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta is back for its second and final weekend</a>, and that’s great. This weekend also sees a new mode join the fun, Rush, which is a classic <em>BF</em> mode. Sadly, Rush in the beta is bad. I played a few matches last night and didn’t enjoy it. Maps are too small, points are too close, and attackers are at a big disadvantage when trying to blow up the MCOM stations.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p> <p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p> <p>We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA seems to get that Rush isn’t working, and a few hours after the beta went live, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143">the team changed how long it takes to blow up an MCOM station with a bomb</a>. Previously, it took 45 seconds, which gave defenders plenty of time to run in and defuse it. Now it takes 30 seconds, which should help. But if this mode is going to join my rotation in the full game in October, more changes will have to be made.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam game pages are getting wider&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Don’t be alarmed if soon store pages on Steam look a bit wider. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">Valve is testing out some new options</a> for developers and publishers that will let them customize and alter how store pages for games look on the popular digital storefront. Valve is also testing out the option to let devs upload high-quality videos to the store page instead of just gifs. Hopefully this makes store pages look nicer and doesn’t turn Steam into a giant mess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is selling really well</strong></h2> <p>2K’s linear action game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a></em>&nbsp;has received fairly good reviews and seems to be a hit with fans of the franchise. But more importantly for the bean counters at 2K, the new <em>Mafia</em> sequel, which is actually set before all the other games in the series, is selling like hotcakes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf/">According to some data shared by Sensor Tower</a>, <em>The Old Country</em> has already sold 800,000 units in just two weeks. PS5 and PC are the biggest platforms for the game. Hopefully this is good news for Hangar 13, and they can avoid layoffs.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em> devs now own the franchise</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718?l=english">On August 14</a> Blackbird Interactive, developers behind spaceship salvage sim <em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker,</em> announced that it had bought back the rights to the game and the franchise from publisher Focus Entertainment. The devs also announced that they were now working on multiple projects within the <em>Hardspace</em> universe and promised a small <em>Shipbreaker</em> update in the future that will tweak some things to reflect the new ownership.</p>

 <p>“We’re eternally grateful for [Focus Entertainment’s] partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the <em>Hardspace</em> IP,” said Blackbird Interactive.</p> <h2><strong>WNBA stars will be able to play with NBA stars in <em>2K26</em></strong></h2> <p>While women players from the WNBA have been a part of the <em>NBA 2K</em> series for a few years now, the latest game in the franchise will let them compete against NBA stars for the first time ever. <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/courtside-report/myteam/">This will be possible only in <em>NBA 2K’</em>s popular (and profitable) MyTeam mode</a>. The women players will be available in all MyTeam game modes.</p> <h2><strong>Wait a minute, is that a Switch 2 dual-screen patent?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>People have spotted what appears to be a new patent from Nintendo for a dual-screen attachment or accessory for the Nintendo Switch 2. Of course, companies patent all sorts of stuff and then never do anything with it. So don’t expect Nintendo to announce this tomorrow, next month, or ever. But it is interesting, isn’t it?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/finally-we-got-some-new-gameplay-of-that-scary-looking-jurassic-park-game-2000617830">We got some new gameplay of that upcoming <em>Jurassic Park</em> horror game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-star-wars-genesis-tattooine-mos-eisley-2000617835">Read our interview with a person trying to turn <em>Starfield</em> into a <em>Star Wars</em> game using mods</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><em>Overwatch 2</em> is moving away from adding more goofball characters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It's Time We Talked about Disco Elysium, Again" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZEAs6M1wts?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/off-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/off-review.1271169/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">What I'd consider the best parts of horror in games aren't jump scares or gruesome monsters chasing you, rather an eerie atmosphere or a lingering feeling of dread – knowing something is a little <em>off</em>. I've long heralded the 2008 cult-classic OFF, an RPG Maker (2003) game from developer Mortis Ghost, for how it wields its lo-fi art style to evoke that powerful sense of dread and reveal things that are truly horrifying. As a small-scale game that only had an English version via fan translation in 2011, this official remaster in 2025 is important for preserving an influential retro-style RPG, especially as it is largely faithful to the original. In some respects, it hasn't aged quite as gracefully as I'd hoped (partially due to the hindsight of having played so many amazing games it inspired in the years since), but OFF's blend of goofiness embedded in a deeply unsettling story has stood the test of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF is one of those games where its limitations are part of its strengths. Color and the absence of it are used to shift the vibe of the overworld in chilling ways as you progress. The hand-drawn sketch-like character designs give a deranged look to enemies that complements their desolate, off-kilter world. And the low-tech pixel art has a way of being a powerful tool for creating a foreboding atmosphere, letting your imagination tease out an underlying psychological horror. These are some of OFF's defining features, and also remain effective as you unravel its disturbing truths.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You control The Batter, a guy rocking a baseball uniform and armed with a bat who is ready to hit some dingers, and you’re on a mission to "purify" a dystopian world of evil ghosts. Without much explanation, a nightmarish cat called The Judge speaks to you in a philosopher's tone to ponder how your decisions will be accounted for. Aside from one specific moment, there aren't choices to make, but it's interesting context for a story that reveals itself through the actions you <em>have to</em> take. I, as the player, felt increasingly uneasy about where things were going – but to The Batter, it's just another plate appearance. That contrast is still quite effective, and OFF makes this distinction clear in its breaking of the fourth wall from the very start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fairly short game, taking about seven-to-eight hours to finish and defeat the secret bosses, including a few new ones. The world is made up of five zones, some of which represent industrial production where workers are ground to the bone by authoritarian figures. Liquid plastic makes up its seas, meat and metal are harvested ad nauseum, and the sugar mines bring about the worst parts of its society. A few dialogue sequences use obscure sketches like they're out of an old textbook and items you inspect in the environment feed into its cryptic worldbuilding. More often, however, it's the unconventional way characters talk to you and accept their meager existences, which grows more disturbing as you see the consequences of your mission.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">OFF Review - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploration is met with basic puzzles that often require you to pay closer attention to the clues embedded in the environment, playing into slightly bizarre changes in the world – door codes hidden in seemingly nonsensical texts, numbers scribbled on the wall guiding you in switch-hitting puzzles, or navigating sets of rooms that break conventional logic. I wouldn’t call these things particularly engaging, but it's the surrealist subtext tucked within them that adds to its uncanny nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A mix of random battles and NPCs patrolling the overworld make up encounters, and this is one aspect of OFF that hasn't really held up: its primitive turn-based combat system. The Batter and the floating circles called Add-Ons, which are very nondescript party members you gather throughout the story, each have a basic attack and special attacks with turns running on an ATB-style system. While The Batter is the heavy hitter, Add-Ons provide more of a support role. Other than prioritizing certain targets and accounting for a few elemental affinities, there isn't much depth or strategic nuance to combat, which becomes a tired exercise outside of a few challenging secret bosses. OFF isn't really about its combat as it's more of a vehicle for everything else it does, but it’s a shortcoming nonetheless.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You don't have to love OFF, but you damn well better respect it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF doesn't necessarily tell a complex story with tons of layers to peel away, nor is it a straightforward one where everything is spelled out for you. It doesn't try to be too clever, yet leaves room for interpretation where all roads lead to a… well, really sad story. For all its accomplishments as a uniquely disturbing experience, something beyond that still sticks with me – it's a strange kind of emotional resonance because of how blunt and unapologetic it is, increasingly off-putting especially with what it ultimately asks you to do. And with each bizarre twist along the way is a unique artistic vision that makes for a memorable experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a few things that have changed in this remaster, one of the biggest being the soundtrack, which is somewhat polarizing to those familiar with the original such as myself. In light of not being able to bring the original composer back on board, this version of OFF features new songs that try to capture the unsettling, industrial, and discordant sound it once had. It largely succeeds, even if I do miss the specific low-tech flavor of the original. In a full circle moment for both parties, Toby Fox (of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/18/undertale-review">Undertale</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">Deltarune</a> fame) contributed to a few tracks, lending his sound in small ways, which was nice to hear. This isn't a soundtrack you're going to bob your head to or throw onto a playlist to evoke memories of a whimsical experience, but it's an important part of OFF's identity. It's one that complements the ghastly barks of its characters and faint ambient sounds that feed into its discomforting vibe.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Indie Games</h3><p>These are my personal favorites. Don't hate, appreciate.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I appreciate OFF as a relic of the old gaming forums where it gained traction and tumblr blogs that harnessed dedicated fandoms, and as a product of a certain era of the internet I look back on quite fondly. Discovering the original felt like unearthing a gem you wouldn't find anywhere else, shaping my taste in horror and helping identify what it is that activates that part of my brain, alongside other RPG Maker hits like Yume Nikki. Evidently, it resonated with others, having paved the way for games like Omori and being a stated inspiration for all-timer Undertale. Replaying OFF was like dusting off the blueprints of some of my favorite games, fascinating to revisit and one you have to put some respect on in spite of the ways it aged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming hot off of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">Deltarune's latest chapters</a> and having been deeply moved by the series so far here in 2025, I have a certain fondness for its progenitors and I can't help but see how OFF's influence persists to this day. Indie games that delve into morality, break the fourth-wall, and subvert expectations have grown and evolved in the years since, meaning OFF doesn’t come across quite as deep as it once did in retrospect. But it is foundational material for the indie RPG scene, and this is a good excuse to play it all these years later regardless of your history.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">OFF is an important relic of the old RPG Maker scene, a pioneer in the realm of independent, small-scale RPGs that innovated in its own right. To have an accessible, modernized version that is a nearly 1-to-1 rerelease, without having to dig up old download links for a fan-translated version, is a win in itself. As a faithful remaster of a 2008 RPG Maker game, however, it also shows its age rather clearly, with a shallow turn-based combat system and barebones structure – such is the thing with aging. But even within those limitations, some things do age gracefully; the eerie atmosphere, off-kilter art style, cartoonish humor that feeds into a uniquely disturbing style of horror, and the breaking of convention that still sends chills down my spine. OFF walked so others could run – so, you don't have to love OFF, but you damn well better respect it.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/off-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week is the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, and with it, the first playable demo of Pokémon Legends: Z-A. I had the chance to play two different ten-minute segments of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and though I’m still left with a <em>lot</em> of questions, I did play just enough to develop some first impressions about the mechanic I’m the most curious about: its battle system.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, a quick aside, to answer a big question many of you no doubt have: I played the Pokémon Legends: Z-A demo on a Nintendo Switch 2, and it ran well and looked moderately better than the new Switch 2 versions of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet. Of course, this is just a demo, and thus I didn’t get to experiment with draw distance or put it to the test with dozens of wild Pokémon on screen. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the demo: one portion of my play session was set in the early-game of only the fourth main mission: Battling in the Z-A Royale. Here, I entered a Battle Zone marked by a red area on the map, where I needed to earn enough ticket points in trainer battles to get a Challenger’s Ticket, which is needed to take part in a Promotion Match. Winning that Promotion Match for the Z-A Royale would upgrade my rank from Z to Y. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If a trainer attacks you when you aren’t looking, that means the opponent’s Pokémon gets that free first attack on your Pokémon, which is also a guaranteed critical hit.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We already knew about this core gameplay loop, which I assume we’ll be taking part in repeatedly until we reach Rank A and earn the vague prize of a single wish. It’s an entertaining enough system, where, at night, you roam the streets of a predetermined area to face other starry-eyed trainers. In expected Pokémon fashion, as soon as a trainer sees you, the battle is on–but in Legends: Z-A, if a trainer <em>attacks </em>you when you aren’t looking, that means the opponent’s Pokémon gets that free first attack on your Pokémon, which is <em>also </em>a guaranteed critical hit. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I find this to be an incredibly rude tactic that goes against the friendly competitive spirit of Pokémon, but of course, I took advantage of it myself when one of my stylish teammates, Lida, suggested I try it out. The tight corners of city streets mean it’s easy to get surprised, but it also offers opportunities for you to crouch and sneak in close to a target yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle begins seamlessly, just like in Legends: Arceus, but Legends: Z-A does away with Legends: Arceus’ slightly modified version of the core turn-based battle mechanics we’re all most familiar with. Instead, Z-A is full real-time action. At least, that’s how it presents itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To attack, you essentially use Z-Targeting by holding the ZL button and then pressing the face buttons to instruct your Pokémon which move to use. This is the same whether you’re in battle, initiating a battle, or instructing your Pokémon to attack an obstacle–like some rocks I saw at the beginning of the mission that none of my Pokémon were strong enough to break. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, each Pokémon can know four moves at a time, and those are the moves you have access to on the four face buttons. Surprisingly, the moves don’t seem to have PP (Power Points), meaning that they can be used an unlimited number of times, with consideration to their cooldown, a new mechanic for Pokémon commonly used for skill-based action games. Different moves have different cooldown times, but the moves I had access to this early in the game all had relatively short cooldowns (around six or seven seconds) and short “casting” times as well that aren’t communicated in any menus.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of these limitations, I was pretty much always able to attack with another move as soon as my Pokémon was done attacking with the first. The moves will “fill up” with color as the cool-down counts down, indicating when you can attack with it again, but I do wish that feedback was more clearly communicated. I ended up just using almost all of the moves available in rotation pretty mindlessly. You can’t instruct your Pokémon to dodge or perform any other maneuvers besides those four attacks, though Pokémon can miss attacks if the opponent is too far from the attack’s range. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle actions appear on the right side of the screen, informing you of things like attacks performed, debuffs, and critical hits. The feedback for missing attacks, however, seemed to be nonexistent, so I can see learning <em>when</em> the best time to attack could be a bit difficult. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In trainer battles, you can’t be damaged or take the hit for your Pokémon (I tried. Mareep still fainted.) But you <em>can</em> get hurt in battles against wild Pokémon and the more dangerous Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon, the other core gameplay plot device in Legends: Z-A. (And you still can’t take a hit for your Pokémon, at least it seemed to be that way.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second part of the demo pit me against a Rogue Mega-Evolved Absol after following the dog-like Zygarde 10% forme to it as part of another early-game mission, this time, the ninth. Somehow, the small-ish Zygarde carries you up to the roof where the Absol is, but apparently your character closes their eyes while this happens as the screen fades out and suddenly you’re on the roof.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, this early in the game, you don’t have the ability to Mega Evolve a Pokémon on your own, so the mysterious AZ lends you a Mega Ring, a Lucario, and the Lucarionite Mega Stone so you can face the Rogue Mega Absol without getting your butt categorically handed to you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this battle, you must dodge to avoid the opponent’s attacks, as Absol <em>is </em>coming for you–not just your Pokémon. I found it a bit cumbersome to balance attacking and avoiding enemy attacks, as you can attack only while you’re locked onto a target with ZL, but you can’t dash or dodge while targeting. I’m sure this is something I’d develop better muscle memory for as I play more, but it felt odd to have my actions restricted like that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a secondary goal to pay attention to when up against Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon: you must collect Mega Power orbs to build up enough energy to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, and keep collecting them so your Pokémon doesn’t de-Mega Evolve. Attacking the Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon forces the Mega Power orbs out of them, which you then must pick up yourself. It’s a pretty clever way to force you to put yourself in danger and use the dodge mechanics. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This fight was much more interesting than the trainer battles, as is expected considering all the extra things I needed to worry about besides pressing the attack buttons. Another thing I noticed is that, although you can’t tell your Pokémon to dodge, they <em>will</em> default to returning to your side when you’re not locked on to an opponent. So if <em>you </em>start avoiding the enemy’s AOE (area of effect) attacks, your Pokémon will too, as long as you give them enough time to retreat. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Legends: Z-A didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but I do hope Legends: Z-A gets challenging enough to make me more intentionally dish out commands and think about switching Pokémon at just the right moment. I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some last-minute housekeeping, as I did briefly explore the menus: Pokémon have the common six-stat spread, no abilities (just like in Legends: Arceus), but <em>do</em> have Natures that affect their stats (<em>unlike</em> in Legends: Arceus). I also found a shop that sells Mints to change these Natures while I played through the ninth story mission.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like I said before, I have a lot of questions and I’m <em>very</em> keen to play more Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but for now, we’ll have to wait until it’s out on October 16 to know more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Casey DeFreitas is a deputy editor of guides at IGN and has been catching Pok</em>é<em>mon since Red and Blue.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> publisher EA is making "changes" to Rush mode to "better balance" the gameplay between attacking and defending players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes arrive just as fans step into Battlefield 6's Open Beta Weekend 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-confirms-playlist-changes-custom-search-and-start-time-for-open-beta-weekend-2"><u>which is live now (August 15) and will run until Sunday, August 17</u></a>. The All-Out Warfare playlist includes Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush… and it's the latter that doesn't seem to be going down all that well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who've yet to play, Rush tasks players with destroying military communications — better known as MCOMs. You can either do this with a heavy explosive assault or by placing a bomb. It's placing a bomb, however, that has been causing problems: with a lengthy 45 seconds between placement and detonating, the timer was too long and giving one side an unfair advantage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer DICE is already on the case, though. In a post on social media, the team <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed</u></a> "we've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team said it would "continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments," which is just as well, as the timer is not the only problem upsetting players right now. Others have criticized the spacing between MCOM objectives and spawn points, making for some unpleasant spawn traps on maps like Iberian, Empire, and Siege of Cairo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the Rush game mode should be disabled in Battlefield 6 until it's been properly worked on," <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a> one unhappy player. "Every map has insane balance problems, ZERO space between sectors/MCOM locations and even 12v12 feels like an utter clusterf**k. Such a shame. Rush used to be great." The post has secured over 3,000 likes at the time of writing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement"><u>EA issued a statement acknowledging the cheating occurring in Battlefield 6, and highlighting its efforts to combat it</u></a> on top of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-forces-pc-gamers-to-mess-about-with-their-bios-to-enable-secure-boot-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-next"><u>requirement for players to enable Secure Boot in their BIOS</u></a>. In the post, the publisher said its existing tech has already prevented 330,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls. Additionally, players reported 44,000 instances of cheating on day one and another 60,000 today so far. EA says it will continue to evolve its efforts to combat cheating, and encourages users to continue reporting issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for information on how to join the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, head to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/BF6_Open_Beta_Guide"><u>our BF6 Open Beta Guide</u></a>, where you’ll find details on how to get into the BF6 Open Beta, the dates and times, available maps, and more.

We're eternally grateful for their partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the Hardspace IP."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement also coincides with the pre-registration for the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow ">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>, where the Hardspace community can sign up for the chance to access exclusive early playtests of future Hardspace projects (and other original IP from Blackbird Interactive), behind-the-scenes development updates, and more.</p>

There's not much to go off in the trailer, showing the inside of a large, cylindrical tower covered in runes as a figure appears to be performing some kind of ritual. A voiceover also ominously describes the need for some kind of weapon, saying, "This weapon is our only chance to save humanity. We must invoke The Third Edict."</p><p dir="ltr">According to a Steam post announcing the new update, it will be available 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 9 PM BST on August 29. Ahead of that, next week there will be a livestream taking place also at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 9 PM BST on August 20 that promises to properly reveal The Third Edict.</p>

            <p>Crimson Desert, Pearl Abyss' visually impressive action game, will be at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in Cologne next week, but if you aren't going you can see how it's shaping up in this new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>In the 13-minute video you get a solid slice of action and exploration, plus a look at the rather splendid visuals. From large-scale fights to boss battles, you'll get a little taste of what Crimson Desert will be offering.</p>
<p>The gameplay jumps in following the protagonist being ambushed by the Drunken Black Bears.</p>

<blockquote><p>FEATURES</p>
<p><strong>Large-Scale Warfare Setting </strong></p>
<p>The video immerses viewers in epic-scale warfare, with countless NPCs battling in real time across every corner of the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>
<p>Kliff undertakes a variety of battlefield missions, from firing cannons to destroying enemy watchtowers and aiding allies in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Traversal Methods </strong></p>
<p>Kliff can call and ride his horse to increase mobility and use the "Crow's Wing" ability to glide across the air in the most efficient route. His skill "Axiom Force" also allows him to not only travel with more maneuverability but to execute strategic maneuvers in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<p>As Kliff advances through missions and the questline, he faces a wide range of combat scenarios, each offering multiple strategies that allow players to adapt and showcase their own combat style. Kliff can strategically use not only his wide array of offensive abilities but also execute well-timed dodges and blocks to gain advantages and switch between multiple weapons.</p>
<p>Kliff's "Axiom Bracelet" enhances attacks with elements of fire, lightning, and ice, with each attribute resulting in different effects on the enemies.</p>
<p>Kliff also uses "Artillery Whistling Arrows" — an arrow that calls in allied forces to take fire on a designated location.</p>
<p><strong>Graphics </strong></p>
<p>Behind the battlefield, magnificent natural environments and terrains, such as rock cliffs and mountain ranges unfold in the background, witnessing the realistic graphics implemented through Pearl Abyss' proprietary "BlackSpace Engine."</p></blockquote>
<p>Crimson Desert was set to release at the end of this year, but recently got pushed into a Q1 2026 release window. We might get more details at Gamescom next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mafia: The Old Country arrived on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC a week ago at the time of this writing, and according to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">new report from data firm Sensor Tower</a>, Hangar 13's latest entry in the series has sold more than <strong>800K copies</strong> in its first week.</p>



<p>That figure is across all platforms, but according to Sensor Tower, 48% of those copies were sold on PlayStation. </p>



<p>"<em>The robust early sales underline the enduring appeal of the Mafia IP and validate the studio’s choice to deliver a linear, narrative-driven experience with cinematic presentation</em>," writes Sensor Tower on LinkedIn.</p>



<p>"<em>The stronger performance on PlayStation may reflect the platform’s strategic alignment with story-focused single-player games.</em>"</p>



<p>Some other first-week stats shared by Hangar 13 show that players have already "<em>dispatched</em>" more than 185 million in-game enemies, and fired over 600 million shots.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's all together a good start for the game, though we'll see if 2K and Hangar 13 will be able to keep up the momentum going forward. The studio is already working to add requested features from players, as Hangar 13 also confirmed that the ability to 'Free Ride' in the map is on its way, along with "<em>new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months</em>."</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Mafia: The Old Country for us, </a>and enjoyed his time with it, despite not being able to explore the Sicilian countryside as much as he would have liked, writing in his review, "<em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot."</em></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>Wuyang</span></a><span>, the 44th hero in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s roster</span></a><span>, isn’t officially in the game yet, but he’s already showing a lot of potential. The water-wielding Support character is playable for the next few days as part of a trial period, and after just one day with the hero, players are coming up with some diabolical combos. I played around with him a bit, and I don’t think he’s my style of Support hero because his low healing output makes him feel a bit too passive for my liking. Despite this, I can see how a skillful player could make the most of his kit by setting up devastating opportunities for teammates. Wuyang feels evocative of the approach to Support hero design from when the first game launched, which was less about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-best-healer-gay-character-support-role-1850071120"><span>healing as the be-all, end-all utility</span></a><span> and more about, well, supporting other players to do their thing. As such, his ultimate, Tidal Blast, isn’t a big defensive ultimate that outheals incoming waves of damage. Instead, it’s one of the game’s new best set-up abilities.</span></p> <p><span>Tidal Blast has two major functions. First, it creates a water-based barrier around either Wuyang himself or an ally. This gives the target a bulky chunk of overhealth that will keep them safe from most incoming attacks. The second thing it does is detonate after a few seconds, doing a little bit of damage to enemies within its radius. However, it also knocks enemies to the ground, similar to Reinhardt’s Earthshatter ultimate, in a circular radius. This will give you a precious few seconds to follow up and do some real damage to an enemy team while they’re on the ground. On its own, this is a really solid ability that can take down enemy defenses and give you a window to wreck shop. However, with coordination, it can also be absolutely devastating when paired with characters like Tracer, Junker Queen, and Sombra, who can quickly dive into an enemy backline.</span></p>   <p><span>Coordination will be key in making these combos work. Timing is everything with Tidal Blast, because if your target is seconds early or late into a play, the whole setup can fall apart. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>players like KarQ have demonstrated a few uses for the ability, like shielding Junker Queen as she heads in with her own ultimate which has her dash forward and inflict Wound damage on enemies, potentially cutting off a group of opponents at the knees and&nbsp; leaving them open for a quick finish. Some characters don’t even need to be dashing into the backline to get value out of Tidal Blast. Orisa’s ultimate, which sucks enemies into her position before bringing down a powerful charged strike onto the area around her, can be risky because it’s somewhat easy to move out of its range if you have a mobility skill. If she goes in covered in a water bubble, however, she can bring enemies into range, then Tidal Blast will knock them down for her to finish them off. It requires precise timing, but there’s potential, when two well-coordinated players are working together, to wipe out several enemies and clear a path to an objective.</span></p> <p><span>Wuyang is playable until August 18, and officially joins the roster on August 26.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1271109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An insider has claimed that there are three playable characters in Resident Evil Requiem; however, we have only seen one in action till now. </p>



<p>Ahead of the new gameplay trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Resident Evil Requiem has been receiving a series of leaks daily. Recently, we learned that the upcoming game will feature ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-last-of-us-combat-and-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last of Us</a>‘ combat and vehicles. We also learned other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story details</a> about RE9. Now, the latest leak says there are more playable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-reportedly-have-alyssa-as-a-playable-character-for-a-bit">Resident Evil Requiem Will Reportedly Have Alyssa as a Playable Character for a Bit</h2>



<p>The new leak about Resident Evil Requiem’s playable comes from none other than AestheticGame (Dusk Golem) on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). In one of his previous posts, he stated that many diehard fans would feel that RE9 is “oddly like the Revelations games.” To which a fan asked whether the upcoming game will have four playable characters like Revelations did. Dusk Golem replied that players will be able to step into the shoes of Leon and Grace, and “a little Alyssa.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon &amp; Grace. A little Alyssa, but that's really it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1955685571231445501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, players have only seen Grace Ashcroft as the playable character in Resident Evil Requiem, and we have yet to learn about any new ones. Dusk Golem has claimed and reiterated several times that Leon will be one of the main protagonists in the game, but Alyssa is a new name. For those who don’t know, Alyssa Ashcroft is Grace’s mother and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-story-details-leaked-by-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> also the giant woman monster following her in the trailer. </p>



<p>As always, this information doesn’t come from an official source, so readers should take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>In other news, the next Resident Evil remakes are expected to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrive in 2027/2028</a>.&nbsp;Also, the upcoming Resident Evil movie by Zach Cregger will feel “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-movie-fresh-edgy-weird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh, edgy, and weird</a>“. What are your thoughts on Resident Evil Requiem having three playable characters?

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/news/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is out later this year, and according to a report, it looks like there'll be a comfortable gap between its release and the arrival of EA's Battlefield 6. According to French website <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch on November 14. If that date is accurate, then Black Ops 7 will be launching during a relaxed window in the gaming calendar, as November is a fairly light month--for now--when it comes to new releases.</p><p>This is par for the course with Call of Duty, as it typically launches between mid-October and mid-November each year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6 has an October 10 release date</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-and-battlefield-are-getting-new-games-in-the-same-year-for-the-first-time-since-2021/1100-6533628/">creating a small buffer between the two military-shooter games</a>.</p>
