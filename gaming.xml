            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Chris Barrett, the former director for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, was fired from the company in spring following a misconduct investigation.</p>
<p>According to a (paywalled) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who cites "people familiar with the matter", Barrett was let go from Bungie in late March following "an internal investigation in which at least eight female employees raised complaints" regarding inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>These complaints include Barrett allegedly calling lower-level female staff "attractive", asking them to "play truth-or-dare", and making "references to his wealth and power" within Bungie, as well as making suggestions he could help these employees "advance their careers". I'm quoting Bloomberg here, not Barrett, by the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-director-chris-barrett-fired-rumor.jpg?itok=SaK6IKVx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-director-chris-barrett-fired-rumor.jpg?itok=s4YnbfUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>director Chris Barrett was reportedly fired from Bungie in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Barrett said that he feels he has "always conducted [himself] with integrity and been respective and supportive of [his] colleagues".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that he "never understood [his] communications to be unwanted", and that he didn't think they "could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable". Finally, he apologizes "if anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with [him]".</p>
<p>As Bloomberg points out, Barrett's career with Bungie began in 1999, and he then went on to serve as a staffer on major franchises like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>. His replacement on&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>has not yet been announced; indeed, his firing from Bungie hasn't been officially confirmed by the company.</p>
<p>Barrett's apparent ousting is part of a wider trend within the gaming industry, one that has seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/french-union-launches-lawsuit-against-ubisoft-over-harassment">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment">Activision Blizzard</a>, and, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-ceo-apologizes-in-wake-of-toxic-culture-report">Bungie itself</a> accused of perpetuating toxic workplace environments for female staff (and staff in general, in some cases).</p>

<p>This also isn't the first of Bungie's woes to be made public this year.</p>
<p>In late July, Bungie announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">lay off over 200 staff</a> as part of a "new path" for the company, a move that then became the <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196" rel="noopener" target="_blank">center of its own controversy</a> after CEO Pete Parsons purchased millions of dollars' worth of classic cars following the sale.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, we haven't heard a great deal about the game since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase">revealed in May last year</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie did <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie">say that it intended to stay quiet for "an extended period"</a> to focus on developing the game, but in the wake of these layoffs and allegations, it's difficult to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is in a great place right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Originally launched in 2021, Hitman 3 brought the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> World of Assassination games to a close. We called it a "satisfying end to a beautiful stealth trilogy" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-review-a-satisfying-end-to-a-beautiful-stealth-trilogy">Eurogamer's Hitman 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Behind Agent 47's myriad disguises I sense a faith in the self-defeating logic of the universe, a conviction that if he is patient and watchful, if he only allows himself to move with the flow, the planets will align, the walls will disappear, and for a second or so, the heart of the machine will be exposed for all to see," wrote Edwin.</p>
<p>IOI is now working on two new projects - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">secretive fantasy game</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">a new 007 James Bond blockbuster</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 publishing director Michael Douse has reopened the topic of video game pricing, commenting that prices have not kept pace with inflation (the general increase of prices and goods) in certain markets, and thereby, with the cost of making blockbuster games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. </p><!--more-->
<p>I mention Outlaws because it's this game that has sparked Douse's thoughts. Writing on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828077545100542195">the artist formerly known as Twitter</a>, he shared an image of the new Ubiworld game's Ultimate Edition, which encompasses the "base" offering and a sack of season pass content and collector's goodies such as a digital artbook, together with the nowadays-routine promise of pre-release access. Douse suggests that special editions such as these are a way of "artificially" hiking prices without, strictly speaking, saying that you're doing so. </p>
<p>"I don't love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail," Douse wrote. "Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community."</p>
<p>Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828079029162791043">added</a> that "I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth", and that publishers should be more upfront and honest about wanting to charge more for games, rather than putting out special editions that muddy the picture. "Almost all games should cost more at a base level because the cost of making them (inflation, for one) is outpacing pricing trends," he wrote. "But I don't think we'll get there with DLC promises so much as quality &amp; communication. Everyone's just waiting for GTA6 to do it lol."</p>
<p>It seems important to remember here that Larian's own Baldur's Gate 3 <em>also</em> had more expensive special editions <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/baldurs-gate-3-pre-order-edition-differences/">encompassing a mix of digital and physical bonuses</a>. Presumably, Douse regards those editions as above-board - I'll let you be the judge. That aside, he's far from the only senior industry figure to argue that the cost of making games like Outlaws is out of whack with pricing.</p>
<p>The mention of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, out in 2025, reminds me of Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer">comments from an earnings call last year</a> that industry prices are "very, very low" versus the number of hours of playtime games offer and player perception of their value.</p>
<p>Zelnick added, however, that this conviction of giving you a lot for a little "doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power". In other words, Take-Two and other publishers aren't about to impose a broad price jump on their audience, though I imagine GTA 6 could get away with it. A Take-Two spokesperson also reached out to me later to clarify that Zelnick wasn't suggesting that the industry should adopt any broader new pricing models, either.</p>
<p>Capcom's president Harushiro Tsujimoto has gone further than Zelnick, noting via <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-president-game-prices-too-low-resident-evil-4-1850874279">Kotaku</a> that development budgets have shot up "100 times" since the heyday of the Famicom in the 90s. Speaking at last year's Tokyo Game Show with regard to the Japanese games industry in particular, Tsujimoto argued that "considering the fact that wages are rising in the industry as a whole, I think raising unit prices is a healthy option for business."</p>
<p>Here's a piece about the pricing/budget question from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/839654c9-f8a2-4e73-a9dd-76a5584f7d1d">the Financial Times</a>, published in January this year, which includes a JPMorgan analysis of pricing trends in the USA specifically. "The cost of developing an AAA game has risen approximately tenfold over 15 years, and the customer has probably not noticed much," it reads. "Poor pricing power means the standard storefront price has risen only 17 per cent since 2007, from $60 to $70."</p>
<p>I do not want to pay more for games like Outlaws, and am mistrustful of pronouncements from people higher up the ladder about what their flagship games should cost. Amongst other things, it seems unlikely that the actual developers of those games would automatically benefit from any rise in revenues - if the past few years have taught us anything, it's that rank-and-file devs are considered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">disposable</a> where leadership are not.</p>
<p>It's also worth reiterating that there's a difference between a video game making its money back, and a video game making enough money for its investors. As one developer told me during an interview about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">Embracer's gutting of Chorus devs Fishlabs</a>, "we make a shitload of money, but it doesn't go back into the games". </p>
<p>I do agree that the cost/price ratio for blockbuster games such as Star Wars Outlaws looks very unhealthy on paper. Attempts to fill that gap have led, amongst other things, to the present glut of live service seasonal content games, which basically rely on players devoting time and money to them at the expense of trying anything else. The cost/price discrepancy has also contributed to the current heavy promotion of generative AI technologies, which publishers often tout as a way of magically shrinking budgets while talking around the implications for their workforces.</p>
<p>But I think there are larger, trickier questions at stake involving the culture and perception of "AAA" games as, basically, exercises in being deliberately unsustainable. Sometimes, I think games such as Outlaws are sold and bought <em>purely</em> on the strength of the idea that they represent an unholy expenditure of resources - capitalism at its most decadent, doomed and spectacular, where you can all but feel the game burning a hole in the universe while you play.</p>
<p>I wrote a piece for Edge before joining RPS which traced the "AAA" concept to its apparent origins in the 90s, based on interviews with various industry executives. The nearest that piece came to a working original definition was that "AAA" games are games with budgets so huge they cannot possibly fail, which is not a formulation that has aged well.</p>
<p>While the biggest of the big-leaguers toy with the prospect of price increases, some publishers continue to experiment with various incarnations of "mid-tier" blockbuster, which offer the impression of "triple-A" largesse on a saner budget. Here's Techland, for example, on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-shorter-standalones-like-dying-light-the-beast-are-the-future-of-games">why shorter expandalones like the recently announced Dying Light: The Beast are "the future of games"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I would not be at all surprised to learn that the voice actors in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealthy</a> Mimimi-style cone’em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sumerian-six">Sumerian Six</a> are Americans doing impressions of British accents. The opening radio chat between starting squad member Sid and a pal has that telltale charming tinge of overeager cockney. It also contains the words “bloody” and “arse” in quick succession, though thankfully not next to each other. The only piles are the logs Sid’s crouched behind as he prepares to sneak up to a cable car guarded by Nazis. That is the only haemorrhoids allusion I will ever make on this website. Until the next time I have to write about Andrew Wilson.</p>
<p>“Oil just use my trusty knoife” mutters Sid as I take down my first guard. Straight away, the animation and noise indicators evoke the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-tactics-blades-of-the-shogun">Shadow Tactics</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/desperados-iii">Desperados III</a> goodness you’re probably expecting. Fine with me - that’s exactly what I’m here for. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">Mimimi’s closing</a> was a real gutpunch, and while I don’t expect anyone to match their exceptional work any time soon, it’s at least reassuring to see Warsaw studio Artificer picking up the torch.</p>

<p>That’s not to say Sumerian Six doesn’t quickly introduce some new tricks. Sid packs a tiny robot spider he can use to ‘hitchhike’ on guards, letting him pass unseen along their patrol routes. I’m also a fan of the option to speed up time, saving you having to wait around for a guard to get into spider range.</p>
<p>A scientist named Isabella soon joins the squad. She’s got a cloaking device, which is possibly the single most uninteresting gadget you can give a stealth character, although it does run out of juice rapidly when she moves. She also has an utterly brutal takedown with a regular hammer that simply cannot help getting jammed in the back of every Nazi skull she swings it at. Very satisfying.</p>
<p>I am currently far too embroiled in the spacefaring demands of long-distant haulage with a different game to spend quite as much time with Sumerian Six as I’d like to right now, but here’s some details from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1429850/Sumerian_Six/">Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by real places and events, Sumerian Six takes you on a journey through an alternate history where folk stories and conspiracy theories are as real as the Nazi threat.</p>
<p>Led by Hans Kammler, a former member of your Squad, the Nazis tap into the occult to create the ultimate Wunderwaffe. Face off against heavily armed, mutated, and supernaturally charged forces, and put your strategic abilities and dexterity to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>As you delve deeper into the Nazi plot, you’ll encounter occult-scientific weapons and ancient Sumerian artefacts linked to Kammler's machinations. A grim future awaits you should the Nazis be victorious, so do your best to prevent that dark timeline from coming true in this real-time tactical stealth adventure.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s out in a couple of days, at it happens - September 2. There's a demo on Steam at the time of writing. Also, looks like one of the six is a bear.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As the map that Call of Duty's battle-royale spin-off Warzone launched with in 2020, Verdansk is beloved by many players, and its return has been highly requested in the years since.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Official Multiplayer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Verdansk's last appearance in Warzone was at the end of 2021, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-last-hours-of-verdansk-event-start-time-and-more/1100-6498399/" data-ref-id="1100-6498399">Last Hours of Verdansk event</a> saw players scrambling to survive the city's bombing. The map had many evolving iterations during its time in Warzone, including both a modern-day version and the retro Verdansk '84. Activision hasn't given any details yet about what form Verdansk might take when it makes its return to Warzone next year.</p><p>If you don't want to wait to reprise the classic map, Verdansk is currently playable in Warzone Mobile, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-first-and-most-beloved-battle-royale-map-is-back-today-with-warzone-mobile-launch/1100-6522040/" data-ref-id="1100-6522040">launched earlier this year</a> with two options for battle-royale maps.</p><p>Call of Duty: Next also revealed more about Black Ops 6 and Zombies, with new details on the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-next-showcase-unveils-new-multiplayer-maps-new-modes-and-beta-offers-for-black-ops-6/1100-6526163/" data-ref-id="1100-6526163">16 maps</a> that will launch with Black Ops 6, and more information about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-trailer-shows-off-ridiculous-weapons-and-three-headed-demon-dog/1100-6526155/" data-ref-id="1100-6526155">game's Zombies mode</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-team-will-use-gamescom-feedback-to-bring-the-game-to-the-desired-quality-level/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was arguably the biggest game at Gamescom 2024, at least judging by the hours of queueing to play the game in the public area and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamescom-2024-award-winners-announced-capcoms-monster-hunter-wilds-takes-all-the-spotlight/">wins</a> from the official awards.</p>
<p>This was the first time the game was playable, and Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/video/701173/Forging+a+Bold+New+Future+Gamescom+24+-+Monster+Hunter+Wilds+Interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> to Gamereactor that the feedback gathered from both press and players will be used by CAPCOM to bring the large game to the desired quality level.</p>
<p><em>I've heard great feedback so far. We've had so many great reactions from everyone who's tried out our showfloor demo. I'm going to go back to Japan and bring all that feedback and that passion that I've experienced here from the fans. When I let the wider development team know about that, I think it's really going to motivate them to keep going on this final stretch of development.</em></p>
<p><em>There are still some things left to finish up before we release Monster Hunter Wilds. But this was the first ever time that anyone outside the company has played the game. So, I think we've got a lot of feedback to take on board. We'll be able to check out reactions from both press and players at this event. And as I said before, I'm not just going to bring that back to motivate the team and make them feel happy and excited. But it's a lot for us to do and to see what we can do to polish up the game in the last phase of development and make sure we can bring the best possible experience to you. Because the scale of the game is so much bigger now, and the volume of content is so much larger, that just brings a larger amount of development work for us to finalize the game to the level of quality that we're happy with.</em></p>
<p>Reading between the lines, it does sound like Monster Hunter Wilds may not launch as soon as 2025 drops, unlike Monster Hunter World, which debuted in late January 2018. However, that's just speculation on our part for now. CAPCOM will surely finalize the release details before the end of the year, possibly announcing the news at The Game Awards. Meanwhile, stay tuned on Wccftech for our own hands from Gamescom.</p>

"The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/dino-1724928501402.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"Even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."</p><p>Dino Crisis first arrived in 1999 and saw three sequels but, while the first two were beloved among fans, Dino Stalker and the final Dino Crisis 3 weren't so well received. The latter was released in 2003, meaning it's been 21 years since a Dino Crisis game was last released.</p><p>Monster Hunter ironically arrived one year later and has since grown into Capcom's biggest franchise. Monster Hunter Wilds, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-xbox-the-game-awards-2023">the next entry announced in December 2023</a>, is expected in 2025.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">In our latest preview of the game</a>, IGN said it's "shaping up to be pretty much what [we] hoped for: A Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Capcom did have a go at making a brand new dinosaur video game with last year's Exoprimal, but the live service co-op shooter lasted just a year before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">Capcom said it would no longer receive new content</a>.</p><p>Exoprimal’s announcement back in 2022 was seen as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dino-crisis-exoprimal-producer">death knell for a potential Dino Crisis revival</a>, but Capcom teased fans recently when it tweeted out a solitary image <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-celebrates-dino-crisis-25th-birthday-with-a-picture-of-a-bloody-dinosaur-foot">to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the much-loved dinosaur survival horror game</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has been so "committed to finalising Stardew 1.6 first", he hasn't actually touched Haunted Chocolatier "in a long time".</p>
<p>Barone shared a post on social media platform X earlier today addressing the highly-anticipated console and mobile ports of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">Stardew Valley 1.6 update</a>. The developer assured his followers that these ports are still in the works, but things are taking a while.</p>
<p>"They have been our primary focus since 1.6 came out for PC," Barone wrote. "It would be a huge relief to me if they were ready today, but they aren't, so all we can do is continue working on them until they are ready."</p>

<p>Barone thanked those who were remaining patient, adding he understood those who were "frustrated or even angry" about the wait. In a subsequent post replying to another user asking why he chose to release the PC version ahead of other versions, Barone said on PC "if there are bugs (which there always will be), they can be fixed really quickly and patches put out, often within hours of discovering the bug".</p>
<p>Patches are not so quick to sort on consoles, he continued. "It's ideal to have all major issues resolved before submitting to consoles. Otherwise players might have game breaking, or even save-corrupting bugs in the game for a week," Barone wrote. "The truth is, I didn't expect console to take this long, but there have been technical issues with the porting process. I was originally hoping it would be maybe, one month apart max.</p>
<p>"At any rate, I feel bad about it"</p> <div>

<p>Within his initial post, Barone added this ongoing focus on Stardew Valley has meant his next game, Haunted Chocolatier, has had to take a back seat in the meantime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay.

			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws comparison video was shared online, highlighting the visual improvements ray tracing brings to the game as well as the hit to performance.</p>
<p>The video,&nbsp;<span>put together by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, does a great job highlighting how the game's visuals are</span>&nbsp;improved with ray tracing and RTXDI, RTX Dynamic Illumination. As always, the performance cost of ray tracing can be quite heavy at all resolutions, and it is especially true for RTXDI, which seems more like technology that only future GPUs will be able to run with acceptable performance. At 4K resolution, with NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 at the Balanced setting and Frame Generation, the game runs below 60 FPS most of the time with RTXDI on an RTX 4080, which is quite telling, considering how the NVIDIA GPU is still among the best GPUs available on the market.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Ray Tracing + RTXDI On vs Off - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6l_Tmn8a4hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While running Star Wars Outlaws at high resolution with all bells and whistles on will require a powerful system, those who plan to play the game at lower resolutions should be able to do so without too many issues, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/">detailed system requirements</a> shared earlier this month are rather reasonable.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It is already available for all those who purchased the Gold and Ultimate Editions.</p>

But there are three black stripes in the middle of the outer layer of the PS5 Pro that are not found on the base models. Billbill-kun noted that the PS5 Pro appears slightly thicker than the PS5 Slim.</p><p>The PS5 Pro seen by billbill-kun does not include a disc-drive. What’s unclear is whether Sony plans to also release a version of the console with a disc drive. A price is not mentioned. The controller remains the base DualSense.</p><p>billbill-kun expects Sony to announce a PS5 Pro during the first half of September 2024. IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>A PS5 Pro has been rumored for some time, with reports indicating a release in November. In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online">alleged PS5 Pro specs leaked online</a>, specs IGN understood to be legit. The headline improvements are to the CPU, which is said to be identical to the standard PS5’s CPU but with a 'High CPU Frequency Mode. That reportedly amounts to a 10% increase to 3.85GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is said to enable faster rendering and higher quality ray tracing powered by 33.5 teraflops. The standard PS5 offers 10.28 teraflops. However, a direct PS5 to PS5 Pro comparison would work out at around 10.28 vs 16 to 17 teraflops.</p><p>Of particular interest, the PS5 Pro is said to have an upscaling/antialiasing solution called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling), custom machine learning architecture, and an AI accelerator. Elsewhere, PS5 Pro has a detachable disc drive and 1TB of storage space.</p><p>This “souped-up” refresh is reportedly designed to boost interest in PS5 ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a> in 2025. As IGN has reported, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>there is a lot riding on GTA 6</u></a>, and not just for Rockstar and Take-Two.</p><p>Sony has form when it comes to releasing a Pro version of its consoles, of course. The PS4 Pro, for example, launched in November 2016, three years after the PS4 came out. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/when-is-the-ps6-release-date-speculation"><u>PS5 Pro launch this November</u></a> would come four years after the PS5 launched in November 2020.</p><p>The release of the PS5 Pro comes amid declining sales of the PS5 itself. In May, Sony said PS5 sales had peaked after the console entered “the latter stage of its life cycle.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Raven Software QA workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">formed the union in 2022</a> at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> studio under the name Game Workers Alliance (GWA), with help from the Communication Workers Of America (CWA), following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-workers-are-unionising-keeping-activision-blizzards-week-lively">several firings</a>. Even at the time, the workers claimed they faced interference and pushback from management in attempts to "undermine" their efforts. It was a fairly complex back-and-forth involving a limitation on who could actually vote  - I recommend reading the coverage linked above to get the full story.</p>
<p>According to Game Developer,  “the initial optimism that followed the studio's unionisation push has now dissipated”, as attempts to reach a collective bargaining agreement have resulted in yet more stonewalling tactics from higher-ups.</p>
<p>"After Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software," said CWA president’s Claude Cummings to Game File. "Unfortunately, that has not happened. We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labour Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority."</p>
<p>Microsoft told Game File they remain “committed to negotiating in good faith,” although the same report points out that Raven’s workers have “yet to make meaningful progress” despite several bargaining attempts since the union’s formation in 2022.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we learned that 44 of 95 workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall 2</a> studio Spiders<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-developers-call-a-strike-over-working-conditions-lack-of-gender-equality-and-parity-and-global-mismanagement"> signed an open letter </a>to their employers detailing several grievances including unsatisfactory working conditions, lack of gender equality and parity, and “global mismanagement”. The workers have called a strike starting next week. In response, Spiders management called the open letter “false and even defamatory accusations” that “in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's employees”</p>
<p>Last month, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft</a> workers formed wall-to-wall unions with the help of the CWA.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Konami has finally acknowledged the possibility of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4 being part of an expected Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the company released Master Collection Vol. 1, which includes the first three Metal Gear Solid games plus some extra classics. 
</p>
<p>
However, a second volume is widely expected to continue the story with Metal Gear Solid 4, 5, and Peace Walker, with fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">digging around on the Konami website</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-includes-references-to-peace-walker-mgs4-and-5">the first volume's game files</a> for details.

Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says">IGN</a> during a preview of the forthcoming remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Konami producer Noriaki Okamura teased the second volume when asked about bringing Metal Gear Solid 4 to modern consoles.
</p>
<p>
"We definitely are aware of this situation with MGS4. Unfortunately we can't really say too much at the moment with Vol. 1 containing MGS 1-3 dot dot dot... you can probably connect the dots!" he said.

"Right now we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series. So sorry, we can't really reveal anything at the moment. But stay tuned!"
</p>
<p>
It certainly seems inevitable Konami will release Metal Gear Solid 4 as part of a second volume, but for now the focus is likely on the Snake Eater remake.
</p>
<p>
Still, the fourth game received widespread critical praise on its release but remains only available on PS3. Considering recent releases and plans to revive the series, Metal Gear Solid 4 is certainly due a re-release of some sort.

            <p>
The classic Verdansk map will return to Call of Duty Warzone next year.
</p>
<p>
Verdansk is the battle royale's original map that's no longer playable. But, following in the footsteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s own OG map return, it will be back in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-suggests-that-warzones-verdansk-map-is-making-a-comeback-in-late-2024">return of the map has been rumoured for some time</a>, but Activision officially confirmed the news in last night's Call of Duty: Next livestream.

</figure>
<p>
It's unclear if Verdansk will be altered in any way or return exactly as fans remember. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-current-day-verdansk-is-gone-and-its-not-coming-back">Amos Hodge, associate creative director at Raven Studios, previously said</a>: "Players don't know it, but current day Verdansk, they'll never play in that state again. Current day Verdansk is gone and it's not coming back."
</p>
<p>
The timing of the map's return is also intriguing. While no specific date has been given, Warzone originally launched on 10th March 2020 so could this be part of a five year anniversary celebration?

<p>
News of Verdansk's return came alongside fresh details on the next map coming to the game in Season 1.
</p>
<p>
Area 99 is Treyarch's new Resurgence map for Warzone, described as "the birthplace of Nuketown". It includes ten points of interest, including a central Reactor and areas like Manufacturing, Loading Bay, and Nuketown Shipping.
</p>
<p>
Nuketown (which sounds very <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>-esque) is a popular recurring map in the Call of Duty series that, as the name suggests, was a nuclear test site.

Warzone Season 1 will launch following the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on 25th October.

<p>
The return of the original map in rival battle royale Fortnite proved extremely successful, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-confirms-return-of-original-map-in-2024-due-to-popular-demand">Epic confirming it will return again this year</a>. It's likely this refers to the now-permanent Fortnite Reload mode, which offers a condensed version of the classic Chapter 1 Island, though a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">much-discussed leak suggests a similar OG event will take pace for Fortnite's Chapter 2 iteration later in 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
The original battle royale PUBG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-is-doing-a-fortnite-and-bringing-back-its-original-island-map">saw its first map return earlier this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-players-told-to-restart-game-offered-cosmetic-ship-trinket-by-ubisoft-as-apology<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Ubisoft has offered PS5 players who were advised to restart <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-early-access">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in order to avoid progression-breaking bugs a peace offering in the form of... a trinket and some Ubisoft Connect currency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-ps5-players-asked-to-start-all-new-save-to-avoid-progression-blocking-bugs">As we reported yesterday</a>, Ubisoft recently emailed some PlayStation 5 players asking them to update their copy of Outlaws to the latest version, following a chunky bug-busting patch. Players should then start a completely new save, Ubisoft said, as they would likely be unable to progress fully in their current save.</p>
<p>This was, understandably, not particularly well received by players who had begun playing on an earlier version of the game - including those who paid more to get early access, and had already invested several hours into it.</p>

<p>Now, in a follow up email, Ubisoft has said it was making amends for this misstep by giving affected Outlaws players a trinket for Kay's ship Trailblazer and 100 of those aforementioned Ubisoft Connect credits, which can be used to unlock in-game rewards or discounts in Ubisoft games, and is typically earned via completing in-game achievements. Ubisoft said it hoped this offering would make players' return to the Outer Rim "a little more special" this time around.</p>
<p>"We fully acknowledge that asking you to start a new game is not the best experience, especially during the Early Access period, and for that we apologise," Ubisoft's email reads.</p>
<p>The company stated it is now "actively working" on adding the Ubisoft Connect currency into players' accounts. That trinket, meanwhile, can be found in Trailblazer's delivery crate once players reach Toshara, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-players-will-return-to-tatooine-and-its-iconic-mos-eisley-cantina">Outlaws' new moon created for the game that's inspired by the African Savannah</a>.</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience, and we hope you enjoy the game," the email closed.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-sales-increase-japan/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series X sales have increased significantly in Japan following the announcement of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">PlayStation 5 price increase</a> which will go into effect next week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5-price-increase-in-japan-sends-xbox-consoles-soaring-up-sales-charts/">Automaton</a>, on Yodobashi, one of Japan's biggest retailers, the console reached number 8 in the games and consoles charts this morning, which is an amazing result, considering the system wasn't even in the top 100 yesterday. With the PS5's price increase, the Xbox Series X has become an enticing purchase, as it now costs the equivalent of $100 less. In addition, it seems like it has become difficult for Japanese players to even purchase a PlayStation 5 system, as the pre-rise stock has been completely sold out at most retailers.</p>
<p>Considering how much the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S have struggled in Japan since release, this is definitely good news for Microsoft as it gears up to release new models of both systems, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/">Series X All-Digital model</a> coming with a 2TB SSD. On the other hand, the negative sentiment surrounding the PlayStation 5 couldn't have surfaced at a worse time, with Sony supposedly preparing to announce the PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">early next month</a>. The increased specs over the base and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will make the system <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">feel even more powerful than it actually is</a>, may not be enough to convince Japanese customers to pay more to play titles that are also coming on Xbox Series X, such as the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds, which has been cited by many on Japanese social media as the game that made them want to purchase a PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>It took a long time, but Square Enix finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-xbox-announced-crossplay-square-enix-on-xbox-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox consoles earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> with Eurogamer at Gamescom 2024, producer Naoki Yoshida discussed the community's response to the launch and reiterated Square Enix's commitment to Microsoft's console platform.</p>
<p><em>Players have been waiting a long time for the Xbox release of Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm happy to say that we've seen a really strong response on Xbox. We've seen communities starting to establish and now they're growing. We've had a pretty good response on Xbox.</em></p>
<p><em>With Final Fantasy XIV as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy XIV, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy XIV's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I want you to just take this as a general argument, but when it comes to the Xbox platform and the fact that it was difficult for Japanese titles to be released on the platform, that's tied into the fact that in the Japanese market there is an extremely low number of users on Xbox. And naturally, because we are Japanese developers, we have a desire for many people in our country to play our games. I think that applies to developers in any country, whichever country they come from, they want many people from their own country to play their games. Because of that, it's really a tough point in terms of a business standpoint. I think that's generally one perspective of how you can look at things in terms of the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>However, at Square Enix, we have been changing our policy. So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles. So with Final Fantasy XIV as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform.</em></p>
<p>Yoshida is referring, of course, to the new multiplatform strategy <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in May by Square Enix. It was largely due to the disappointing sales of PlayStation 5 exclusives like Final Fantasy XVI (also produced by Yoshida-san) and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The former, in particular, is just about to launch on PC, and it's not at all far-fetched to imagine it will eventually launch on Xbox, too. It may be more tricky with the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, as Sony is believed to have secured those games for good.</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro’s design details have surfaced online, and it seems that the mid-gen refresh console will be similar in design to the PS5 Slim model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reliable gaming news source <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> recently shared more details about the upcoming console, including the official name, design details, announcement window, and more. According to their latest report, as everyone expected, the mid-gen console’s official name was PS5 Pro. Read about the design details, announcement window and more below. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun finding the information suggests that it’s been uploaded on the backend of retailer websites… somewhere, suggesting that the console will soon be announced. </p>

</div></figure>



<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-design">PS5 Pro Design </h2>



<p>The report states that the PS5 Pro design will feature “the same white colour” for the outer panels as the previous models. On the front of the console, players will find 2 USB-C ports and a power button. Additionally, there will be three “black stripes” across both side panels instead of the Slim’s one stripe. Lastly, the PS5 Pro model is a bit bulkier than the Slim models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-controller-and-announcement-window">Controller and Announcement Window</h2>



<p>Moreover, according to the images billbil-kun has received, the PS5 Pro doesn’t seem to have a disc drive; however, this needs to be confirmed. Regarding the controller, the Pro model will still feature the standard DualSense Controller in the box. Lastly, the report states that the PS5 Pro “will be announced very soon” and could be announced as early as “the first half of September 2024.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported that a PlayStation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a> is seemingly scheduled for the end of September, and the PS5 Pro announcement could arrive during this event. Also, per our developer and manufacturer sources, the PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track to release around mid-November.</p>

            <p>
The design of Sony's under-wraps but much-discussed PlayStation 5 Pro model has reportedly been posted online. 
</p>
<p>
Prolific leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">bilbil-kun</a> today posted an illustration showing the console model - which looks very similar to that of the base PS5 - and provided a few more details on its reveal. 
</p>
<p>
White in colour, with two USB-C ports and a power button on the console's front, the only major difference is the three ridged lines on the console's shell. This is an upgrade to the one ridged line on the PS5 Slim.

The PS5 Pro will be offered as a digital-only model, reportedly to keep costs down, though today's report suggests it may still be possible to affix the PS5 disc drive add-on to it - although this is not confirmed either way.
</p>
<p>
There are no changes expected to the PS5 DualSense controller, meanwhile.

<p>
The leak of the PS5 Pro's design comes just weeks ahead of its formal announcement, today's report states, which is expected next month - in September.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking PS5 Pro's path to release over the past year, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first popped up in the summer of 2023</a> that Sony was prepping a more powerful PS5. In February of this year, CNBC stated there was now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-expected-this-year-report">"broad concensus" that Sony was indeed preparing PS5 Pro</a> to launch "in the second half of 2024". 
</p>
<p>
In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">PS5 Pro technical specs appeared online</a>, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate. Digital Foundry did its own analysis, and dubbed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">PlayStation 5 Pro to be "the most powerful console yet"</a>. April brought word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">Sony was prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new games (or older ones with new patches) that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware. And yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">more PS5 technical details arrived in May</a>. 
</p>
<p>So, will you be buying PS5 Pro?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>How do you remake a cult classic? Change too much and you alienate the hardcore fans of the original, whilst failing to adapt and imrpove ancient mechanics will leave modern audiences cold. Despite having a good stab at it, it’s a conundrum that NatsumeAtari never manage to satisfyingly resolve during the course of their retro 2D slash ‘em up, Shadow of the Ninja- Reborn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u6KyZsKNLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original Shadow of the Ninja arrived on the NES in Europe way back in 1991. It was a 2D 8-bit side-scrolling platforming ninja ‘em up; one that stood out in a shadowy genre thanks to its hugely enjoyable 2 player co-op, which saw two ninjas leaping, dashing, and lobbing shuriken with wanton abandon. Now, thirty-something years since its EU debut, Shadow of the Ninja has been reborn under the watchful eye of Tengo Project. Meanwhile, original creatives Dynamic Productions and Iku Mizutani have returned to handle character illustrations and music respectively. And their involvement has paid off, as the presentation of Shadow of the Ninja Reborn is absolutely spot on. Graphically, whilst still a humungous improvement on the original’s 8-bit visuals, Reborn retain its predecessor’s distinctive pixel-coated retro-charm. </p>


<p>Character models are so chunky you can almost chew ‘em; huge mechs clunk into battle, oiled-up beefcakes flex their biceps before charging into battle, whilst gun-toting robo-mercs unleash bullet hell every moment they can get. It’s so charming, so bonkers, it’s like the 90’s never went away! The sprites of returning ninjas Hayate and Kaede are delightful too. Their range of animations are beguiling, and they both look cool slicing through hordes of minions – even if Kaede has, once again, seemingly forgotten to wear any pants. The music is – of course, considering Mizutani’s return – grin-inducing guitar-wailing brilliance. Whilst the environments themselves ooze with incidental details; lightning flashes, thunder brews, and rain pours. The atmosphere that Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn gives off is palpable, who needs polygons huh?</p>


<p>Local co-up is present, correct, and as fun as ever. So, why doesn’t Shadow of the Ninja Reborn deliver on all of its promise? For me, it is too respectful of the original game. The 90’s era levels have been re-produced with likely too much diligence; often becoming a teeth-gnashing grind of pixel-perfect leaps, endless bad-guys, and a peculiar pre-occupation of making it hard to tell if a surface can be clung to or not. My skilled ninja warrior would often hilariously bounce off a wall rather than attach to it, even though visually the wall looked virtually identical to the other’s I had been clambering on. </p>
<p>Controls are unnecessarily fussy too. Climbing is messy, with Hayate and Kaede rarely behaving themselves and dying unnecessarily because of it. Whilst only being able to access one collected power-up at a time fails to add any of the intended strategy, just frustration as you drink a health-potion rather than lobbing that bomb. There’s also a definite input lag, which, when combined with some old-school difficulty levels, can create some near unscalable difficulty spikes. So much so in fact, that my regular local co-up pal soon bounced off the arduous challenge, forcing me to go it alone through what proved be an interminable slog, despite the inclusion of occasional – and much welcome – check points.</p>

<p>Whilst the correct balance of homage and reinvention when it comes to a remake will always be subjective, I can’t help but feel that Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn is too devoted to its predecessor. If you want that old-school uber-challenging retro experience, warts and all, then you’ll love what you find here, for the rest of us, a few more modern design sensibilities would prove a welcome respite.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn looks the part, this is a sumptuous 2D scroller that clearly loves the 1990s with unabashed and borderline obsessional desire. It effectively emulates the experience of playing a game from that era too. The problem is that includes dodgy controls, plentiful gameplay frustrations and difficulty spikes so sharp they’d make a 42-year-old man cry. And they did.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-to-feature-similar-design-of-base-model-reveal-set-for-early-september.966879/</guid>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-2tb-storage/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> design won't be much different that that of the current base model, according to a new report from a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">provided</a> some new information on the yet-to-be-released system, confirming that it will unsurprisingly be named PlayStation 5 Pro, judging from the front of the final packaging they were able to see. The front of the final packaging also revealed the console's design, which looks pretty much the same as the current base model, barring a few minor differences and a slightly thicker size.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the PlayStation 5 Pro may be released without a disc drive, as the packaging seen by the leaker shows the system without one. The leaker, however, couldn't confirm if this model will be the only one to get released. Additionally, the console will come with a standard DualSense controller.</p>
<p>Regarding the timing of the announcement, billbil-kun couldn't precisely confirm when the PS5 Pro will be revealed, but it shouldn't take much longer, as the long-rumored system should be revealed during the first half of September.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced, but it was basically an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open secret at Gamescom 2024</a>, with developers talking freely about it even to our Alessio. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The original Resident Evil 2 from 1998 comes shambling and groaning back to PC]]></title>
            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc.966876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Step this way please, fans of pre-rendered backgrounds and pixellated blood spatters. There is something waiting for you in the window of the local internet video game store, GOG.com. Resident Evil 2, the original 1998 survival horror, is now buyable, downloadable, and yes, even playable on PC. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's up <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">on GOG for £9</a> currently, boasting "Improved cutscenes and subtitles" while also making the bonus character scenarios unlocked from the beginning. For those who've forgotten, these are the two special runs you can do featuring gas-masked military man Hunk, or giant piece of sentient soy, Tofu. This port also seems to squash a few long-standing bugs. "Fixed issues with Rooms 114 and 115 (missing text), Room 210 (invisible diary), and Room 409 (looping sound)," says the blurb. Intriguing.</p>
<p>This is all part of an ongoing roll out of the original zombie-zappin' scarers. Resident Evil 1 was put on sale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">a couple of months ago</a>, while Resident Evil 3 has also been <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">listed as "coming soon"</a> since then. It's not the first time any of the games have been out on PC, but it is now the easiest (legal) option when it comes to frollicking around Raccoon City in your big bloodstained bandage.</p>
<p>Old Resi 2 is a good aperitif if you've recently played the Resident Evil 2 remake. The remake plays with your memories of the late-ninties statue-pusher in some fun ways. You might gingerly walk down the much beautified bottom floor corridor of the police station, muttering in mental preparation that the first licker will appear overhead shortly. But then... it's nowhere to be seen. Only later, when you're lulled into puzzle solving mode, does the monster show up on another floor entirely, skittering across the ceiling with nary a FMV cutscene to steady your nerves. Well played, Capcom, you got me. </p>
<p>Since these small differences are set against a largely faithful recreation of the original's spirit, they stand out as fun expectation-bouncers rather than iconoclastic upheaval. As you can probably tell, I played a lot of Resi as a young 'un, and I'm fond of the remake. If the various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">rumours about remakes for Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0</a> prove to be true, perhaps we'll see more clever modernisations. But even without those, there is something valuable in going back to the source material, even if you never actually played it in the bright, free beauty of the 1990s. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We've changed some of the pre-existing missions such as Occupation, Defense, and Escort to Extermination or Destruction to give players a run-and-gun styled fast-paced combat experience as they enjoy repeated farming. The reward system has also been adjusted to reflect this: we've significantly increased the amount of EXP gained from defeating monsters and completing missions in Hard Infiltration Operations, and while Special Operations are still the better option for farming EXP, Infiltration Operations can now provide a decent amount of EXP as players farm items. Additionally, we've increased the amount of rare basic materials you can receive from clearing Hard Infiltration Operations. We'll continue to add more content that allows players to enjoy their favorite styles of combat.</p><p>- Added directions to appear when using Ecive during missions.</p><p>- Monsters will no longer target players who are participating in other missions.</p><p>- Story dialogues will no longer be repeated in Hard Difficulty missions. As a result, Hard Difficulty missions will not play additional voice lines or subtitles.</p><p>- Changed the Immunity mechanics of certain Named Monsters. Replaced the sphere destruction mechanic of Eterllick, Celdir, Dmigor, and Plaudia with shooting weak points.</p><p>- Increased the barrier hit range of Named Monster Eterllick.</p><p>- Players will no longer be teleported when joining Largescale Outpost missions.</p><p>- Increased the Gold reward for completing Hard Difficulty Largescale Outposts by approximately 3 times.</p><p>- Improved the routes so that shards acquired from Void Fragments can be used on the Fusion Reactor in the same battlefield.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards obtained from Void Fragments.</p><p>- Changed monster types and spawn locations in certain Void Fragment missions.</p><p>ㄴ "Hagios: Dune Base," "Vespers: Moonlight Lake," "Echo Swamp: Abandoned Zone," and "Fortress: Frozen Valley"</p><p>- Removed the starting requirements (Void Shards) of Void Fusion Reactors and added requirements (Void Shards) to the Reconstructed Devices that appear in Fusion Reactors.</p><p>- Made an improvement so that only one type of shard is required when using the Reconstructed Device in a Void Fusion Reactor.</p><p>- Reduced the time to interact with Reconstructed Devices.</p><p>- Summoned Reconstructed Devices now expire 10 seconds after all participants have used them.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>With the 1.1.0 update, we've made adjustments so that a single playthrough of a Void Fragment will yield enough Void Shards to use the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors once. We've also improved accessibility by making Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors on the same battlefield drop and require the same type of shards. While you can still obtain two types of shards from Void Fragments, the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors now require only one type of shard, further improving accessibility.</p><p>We are constantly monitoring feedback to further improve Outposts and Void Fragments. For long-term improvements, the dev team is considering ideas to evolve Outposts into a non-stop combat experience, as well as improving the farming accessibility of Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors with the integration of content.</p><p>In this 1.1.0 update, we've also changed the spawn location of certain Void Fragment missions to provide an efficient way to farm shards for each attribute. In addition, we've added snipers in certain Void Fragment areas to prevent the use of macros.</p><p>We hope these changes will make your farming experience more enjoyable.</p><p>- Players can now view the "Past Mission Results" from the menu after completing Special Operations, allowing them to restart the mission.</p><p>- Improved display of the mission tooltip information on the Special Operation and Infiltration Operation World Map screen.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards that can be picked up in Special Operations.</p><p>- Acquire additional Descendant EXP when completing waves in Special Operations.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We've made adjustments to Special Operations so that there is improved efficiency when farming EXP. While we recognize many players enjoy leveling up through Sterile Land Mine Blocking, we still believe it's not as rewarding as other EXP farms that require a simpler play, such as Void Fragments.</p><p>As a result, in this update, we've added EXP when clearing waves in Special Operations. The fastest, "Mine Blockade," will now give you about 1.5 times more EXP than before, while "Resource Defense" and "Neutralize Experiment" will give you 2 times more EXP. We hope this will help players level up more efficiently across various Special Operations.</p><p>(2) UI/UX</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow multiple socket types to be assigned to a single module socket.</p><p>ㄴ The socket type applied to Loadout Setting 1 can also be used for Settings 2 and 3 as well.</p><p>- For slots with multiple socket types, the socket type can be changed from the selected menu</p><p>ㄴ Each socket type for Loadout Settings 1, 2, 3 can be changed so they all may differ.</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow the dismantling of equipment during combat.</p><p>- Added dead zone settings to the game controller options.</p><p>- Made improvements so that the Amorphous Materials linked to Fusion Reactors are displayed in the acquisition information, like Intercept Battles.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to designate the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials.</p><p>- Reduced research time for [Standard/Precision] Ion Accelerator, Phase Exchanger, and Adjustment Control Axis.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We have added the ability to select the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials. One consequence of this change is that only two studies in the research list will result for each enhancement material. This means, previously, multiple Adjustment Control Axis could be simultaneously created; now, when it comes to Adjustment Control Axis, only two can be researched at the same time.</p><p>With the addition of the research quantity selection feature, players can now research up to 500 Adjustment Control Axis at a time. This allows them to conduct more research in one go, reducing the number of visits to Anais. However, the inability to simultaneously conduct multiple research will reduce the amount of enhancement materials that can be acquired in a short period of time.</p><p>While we want to give players new features, we also want to make sure that players in certain situations aren't losing out. As a result, we've shortened the time it takes to research enhancement materials so that despite only doing one research at a time, you'll still acquire a similar amount of enhancement materials as before. We hope this will help players research and utilize enhancement materials more efficiently.</p><p>- Made improvements to display only modules you have in duplicate when combining modules.</p><p>- Increased the number of symbols that can be displayed, when designating them as Attached Items, to 8.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to set an "Equipment Option" category in "Filter all as junk" for Reactors and External Components in equipment.</p><p>- Changed the display location and design of the random options to improve inventory slots. Removed displays for the Reactor's attributes/Arche type and fixed the display for External Components set effects.</p><p>- The Reactor icon has changed so that it now varies, depending on the Arche type.</p><p>- Changed some External Component icons to differentiate their appearance based on their DEF, Shield, and HP stats.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>Previously, in Update 1.0.7, we added information for random options, Arche type of Reactors, and External Component sets for item icons. The feedback we received was, that players were distracted, as there was too much information included. Based on this, we've made improvements so that the icon information is presented in a cleaner, more organized way. Dev Team will continue to listen to the valuable feedback given by community and players as we continue to make improvements to the game.</p><p>- Schematized the "Amount of Owned Equipment" tooltip in inventory.</p><p>- Significantly increased the quantity of Shape Stabilizer you own.</p><p>- Improved the map to show the location of records needed to be found when progressing Descendant related quests.</p><p>- Made improvements by adding a Tracking On tab when researching, making it easier to view the tracked target.</p><p>- Improved the Intercept Battle screen to display the number of Linked Amorphous Materials players have at each Intercept Battle.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view "Mission Details" through the mission tooltip on the map.</p><p>- Improved the display of the red dot when there are unacquired Battle Pass items.</p><p>- Improved the ability to purchase a one-time, large quantity of enhancement materials at the shop.</p><p>- Improved the ability to preview each component of a bundled product without moving the screen.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view each Evolution Stage of an evolving skin in the shop.</p><p>- [Console] Added attributes and Arche keywords, by type, to the Descendant and Weapon Module screens, making it easier to find modules on console platforms as well.</p><p>(3) Descendants</p><p>- Jayber</p><p>ㄴ Fixed an issue where some stats were not reflected in Jayber"s "Turret."</p><p>Skill Power Modifier, Additional ATK for skills when attacking Colossus/Legion of Darkness/Order of Truth/Legion of Immortality, Incoming Damage Modifier</p><p>ㄴ Improved Jayber's "Turret Sync" effect to apply to summoned turrets.</p><p>ㄴ When equipping skill module "Turret Engineering," instead of improving summoned turrets to create a "Turret Zone," increased cooldown of "Turret Engineering."</p><p>- Blair</p><p>ㄴ Improved Blair's "Pitmaster" Skill so it now increases the Critical Hit Rate by the number of "Flame Zones" he has, up to a maximum of 5.</p><p>ㄴ Increased Blair's "Flame Zone" Skill DMG.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the DMG dealt by Blair's "Burn" Skill effect.</p><p>ㄴ Made changes so that Blair's "Extinguish" Skill no longer retrieves "Flame Zones."</p><p>ㄴ Improved "Taste of Aggression" effect to stack for the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>ㄴ Improved the MP Heal per "Flame Zone" from the "Taste of Aggression" and "Power of Fire" effects to be proportional to Blair's Max MP.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the maximum amount of "Flame Zones" that can be absorbed through the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the duration of the "Blaze Up" Skill, reducing its MP cost.</p><p>ㄴ Improved the "Burn Taste" Skill so that the skill can be halted when pressing the button during use.</p><p>• Increased skill DMG of the "Burn Taste" skill and improved it to be affected by duration-related modules.</p><p>• Increased the Max Stack when equipping the "Incendiary Bomb" skill module, and reduced MP cost.</p><p>• Increased the number of "Small Fireballs" for the "Deadly Cuisine" skill when the "Classic Chef" skill module is equipped, and increased the effect of the "Pitmaster" skill based on the Flame Zone count.</p><p>- Ajax</p><p>• Improved Ajax's "Orbit Barrier" and "Hyper Cube" barrier to be affected by attribute resistances, and increased the barriers' HP and DEF ratios.</p><p>• Increased the ratios of barrier-related stats when the "Life Barrier" and "Void Barrier" skill modules are equipped.</p><p>• Fixed an issue with continuously recovering shield for "Void Walk" and "Matrix Recomputation" skills and increased the Max Shield Up ratio.</p><p>• Improved the "Void Walk" skill to have faster motion transitions when used while enhanced.</p><p>• Modified the "Body Enhancement" skill to increase HP, DEF, and Shield, and improved it to grant 100% Void Energy when used, but increased the Cooldown and Skill Cost.</p><p>• Changed the "Void Walk" skill so that it can be stacked when the "Void Charge" skill module is equipped, and increased the damage dealt proportional to DEF when using the "Void Walk" and "Expulsion" skills.</p><p>• Improved "Void Charge" to restore "Void Walk" stacks and reset the Cooldown of "Expulsion" when used while enhanced.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>In this update, we've made balance adjustments to Ajax, Blair, and Jayber. We've been closely analyzing feedback from the community and continue to monitor all Descendants and Ultimate Weapons. As we move forward with this Invasion Season, we'll continue to balance more Descendants and Ultimate Weapons based on your feedback. We'll do our best to make your experience more enjoyable and fair.</p><p>- Improved level balance for Descendant spawn sounds.</p><p>- Removed a voice that would play repetitively whenever hitting a note while Luna's "Noise Surge" skill module was equipped.</p><p>(4) Equipment</p><p>- Changed the 4-piece set effect of the Ultimate External Component "Bravery" to increase "Skill Duration" without any conditions.</p><p>- Increased the "Incoming Damage Modifier" values for the "Pain Reliever", "Sensory Dep (HP)", "Sensory Dep (MP)", and "Psychological Victory" modules.</p><p>Optimization Improvements</p><p>- Made some performance improvements when fighting many enemies.</p><p>- [PC, PS5, XSX] Made some performance improvements when using ray tracing.</p><p>- [PC] Optimized the Shader preparation stage.</p><p>Bug Fixes</p><p>(1) UI/UX</p><p>- Fixed an issue in the inventory where the DPS value within the weapon icon would change when designated as junk while in "View Module Stats" mode.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the quantity tracker on the HUD would not update if you have Tracking On for an item you do not have on the Library screen.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the "Start with the current squad" button would not display on the results screen after completing the final wave of Special Operations.</p><p>- Changed the squad recruitment countdown to no longer appear in the center of the screen when "Restart Mission" is selected in matchmaking.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the icons for High-Value Mark for Arrest and Mark for Arrest's icon looked unnatural when viewing their acquisition information.</p><p>- Changed "Firearm Critical Hit Resistance" to display to 3 decimal points in the inventory's info screen as well.</p><p>- Fixed an issue with the Kingston Special Operation not being counted for the Resource Defense award.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the "None" setting was showing as "Friends Only" in the Support Requests options.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where skipping the Descendant and Weapon research cutscenes would skip the acquisition result screen sound.</p><p>- Improved the display of names and weak points for enemy commanders and assassination targets so that they are now only displayed within the Ecive radius.</p><p>(2) Descendants</p><p>- Fixed an issue where, when using Bunny's "Lightning Emission" and "High-Voltage" skills, the first hit's connection effect would not appear.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the status effect icon for Bunny's "Electric Transition" skill would appear to be the same as her Speed of Light icon.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where the "Ice Sphere" for "Viessa" and "Ultimate Viessa" looked the same.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where notes would not display in certain situations while Luna's "Noise Surge" skill module was equipped.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where some Descendants' skill damage was not being applied correctly to Void Fragments.</p><p>(3) Equipment</p><p>- Fixed an issue with the Ultimate Weapon "Smithereens" where the Fire Rate reduction from the effect of the Unique Ability "Fearlessness" was slower than stated.</p><p>- Fixed an issue where each effect's icon looked the same on the Unique Ability info screen of "The Final Masterpiece".</p><p>- Fixed an issue where some Ultimate External Components would display the same icon when triggering their set effects.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-a-rising-tide-floats-all-boats-xbox-on-the-universal-benefits-of-accessible-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Around six years ago, Xbox took a leap of faith. The company unveiled the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/05/16/xbox-adaptive-controller/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a new type of gamepad that defied traditional design conventions in service of a singular mission: make video games accessible to all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The console maker has devoted itself to that goal in the subsequent years, rolling out new accessibility options for its video game software, bringing external developers into the fold so they can test their own accessibility features, waiving the licensing fee for accessible hardware developed through its 'Designed for Xbox' program, and building entirely new devices such as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/microsoft-unveils-new-accessibility-hardware-including-xbox-adaptive-thumbstick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those initiatives with Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, Xbox senior accessibility product manager Kaitlyn Jones and principal designer Chris Kujawski explain the benefits of accessible design–whether you're talking about hardware of software–are profound but can often be easy to miss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We define accessibility as 'ensuring that anybody who wants to be able to use or play can do so.' It can mean a lot of different things [...] so it does vary, but our general philosophy is that a 'rising tide floats all boats.' When it comes to accessibility, we don't compete. We just want anyone to play regardless of the title or platform," says Jones.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Collaboration a &quot;core part&quot; of Xbox's accessible design process">Collaboration a "core part" of Xbox's accessible design process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In practice, Microsoft applies that philosophy by working directly with disabled players. Kujawski explains there's a saying within that community: "nothing about us, without us." That, he says, influences every decision Xbox makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why, for example, the company took a myriad of Xbox Adaptive Joystick prototypes to a hospital in Seattle so they could be put through the wringer. The team have to understand use-cases that might not be immediately apparent. In this instance, that testing slalom highlighted the need for the Joystick to be mountable on solid surfaces, allowing it to be used by people who might not be able to hold it in their hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are not designing something and then handing it over," adds Kujawski. "It's a co-design process. So throughout the process there are many different checkpoints and many different departments–whether that's individuals or charities or hospitals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team has built a huge network where folks can get feedback from, so that's a very core part of the design process. In addition to that, the halo effect [of our work] has meant that accessibility has become a part of our game design process. We don't make products now without doing an accessibility check."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those checks means Xbox now strives to make everything down to the cardboard boxes that house its consoles accessible. No detail is too small, and no compromise is too big.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Controller debuted in 2018</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wasn't always the case. Kujawski explains each new accessibility concept has to be pitched up the chain. The team has a fluctuating roadmap of products that are "always competing for space," and will often cook up experimental 'proof-of-concept' projects before entering the pitching room.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Pitching] has gotten easier since the Adaptive Controller," says Kujawski. "There's more of a pull. [The Adaptive Controller] wasn't a hard sell, necessarily, but there was a lot of explaining to do. Because leadership gets pitched ideas all of the time, so at the beginning it's just one of many. But because of the unique nature of [our projects] and the match to Microsoft's mission, it has become easier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones adds there's now a "better understanding" internally about how accessibility can have a positive impact on an entire playerbase. "For example, our co-pilot feature, [now called] '</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot">Xbox Controller Assist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,' was pitched to leadership as something that would allow a parent and a child that was just learning to game to be able to play together," she continues.&nbsp; "Now we know it's also a really fantastic accessibility feature, so I think discussing those alternative use cases that just make experiences more viable for anyone is really important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Jones says there's never any pressure on the accessibility team to "sell a certain number of units," although pricing is very much a consideration. "What we do want to do is ensure that product is as low cost as possible," she adds. For example, in a bid to keep costs down for consumers, Xbox chose to make its Adaptive Joystick wired instead of wireless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[That way] we don't have to pay for battery," says Kujawski. "It also makes it lighter. There have been other joysticks on the market like this, that are hardwired to USB. With those, you have one length of cable. We ship with a two meter cable but we made it removable on purpose, so if you're playing right next to the Xbox Adaptive Controller you can switch that out. We're always making those trade-off and asking 'what gives us the most flexibility, what helps us with cost, and what expands the reach of the products?.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building products that are accessible, flexible, and affordable is evidently paramount. But what about products that last? Kujawski reiterates that Xbox is in this for the long haul. That means it won't be refreshing its slate of accessibility hardware on a whim. These are devices built to transcend console generations (and whatever comes beyond). "We would definitely get a lot of negative feedback if, say next generation, this [device roster] doesn't work," he adds. "That's a real bad look and it's just a bad policy. The longevity of it is super important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/community/for-everyone/accessibility">You can learn more about Xbox's range of accessibility tools and hardware on Xbox Wire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Back in March, Bungie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">announced a leadership reshuffle</a> on their Marathon reboot project, with former Valorant dev Joe Ziegler replacing veteran Bungie designer Christopher Barrett as director. It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior">new Bloomberg report</a> citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What does "inappropriate behaviour" mean? According to two of Bloomberg's sources, it means comments upon the appearance of lower-level employees, requests to hang out together, suggestions that he could use his wealth and power to advance their careers, and invitations to play truth-or-dare.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, Barrett would befriend women in various Bungie departments and bombard them with text messages which, the site says, "blurred the lines between professional and personal". Several people interviewed described Barrett's advances as unwanted, and said that they felt uncomfortable given Barrett's greater seniority at Bungie. Bloomberg have reviewed some of the text messages in question, but aren't sharing details to avoid exposing their recipients. </p>
<p>Bloomberg claims that Barrett was eventually let go following an internal investigation in which at least eight women raised complaints about him. That last bit is according to eight sources, including both some of the women who reported Barrett and others who were involved with the investigation or spoke to the women who raised complaints. Barrett's departure was kept quiet: certain Bungie staff apparently thought that he had gone on sabbatical, but then discovered that his company accounts had been disabled.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Barrett both pushed back against the claims and apologised for his behaviour. "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends," he wrote. "I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."</p>
<p>Bungie parent Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, have told Bloomberg that they take "all complaints of misconduct very seriously" and that "it is our policy and practice to investigate every complaint promptly and take action based on the findings of our investigation", without commenting on Barrett's case in particular.</p>
<p>It's not clear how far back Barrett's alleged misbehaviour goes, but this isn't the first time we've heard about predatory behaviour at Bungie. Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">IGN</a> published an extensive report on life at the Destiny studio, citing 26 current and former staff. Those interviewed shared experiences of "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard".</p>
<p>The news about Barrett comes as Bungie "reposition" for an uncertain future, following what leaders have described as a period of "overly ambitious" expansion and "misfires" in a time of general economic precarity. The studio recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people and formed a new studio within Sony</a> to shore up their finances.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
