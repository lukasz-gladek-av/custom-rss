            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI, which may be the most highly anticipated game of all time (an admittedly difficult metric to quantify), has been delayed to May 26, 2026. The game was set to release some time this year, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/31/take-two-ceo-on-gta-6-release-date-we-want-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-the">with periodic soft assurances from&nbsp;Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick that the game was on track</a>, but that is no longer the case. In a statement on social media, Rockstar games announced the delay and wrote, "We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>



<p>Rockstar's games have historically and consistently received delays following their announcement so while the push is disappointing, it is not unexpected. We still don't know much about the game beyond its, so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdBZY2fkU-0">only official trailer</a> (which quickly <a href="https://gameinformer.dev.anyforsoft.com/news/2023/12/06/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-surpasses-100-million-views-breaks-record-for-most">garnered over 100 million views</a> to set a YouTube record for most views within a 24-hour period) and it never had a locked-in release date beyond 2025 before today.</p>

<p>The game was officially announced in December 2023 and is set in a modern-day Vice City (modeled after Miami and South Florida), it appears to star two protagonists, including the series' first female lead, although Rockstar has not yet officially divulged details on these characters or their relationship.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has yet to be confirmed, though if it does launch on the platform, it will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">likely arrive later</a>.

Beginning today, hardware will see significant price changes based on country/region. Microsoft has also confirmed it will begin launching some first-party games at $79.99 this year.</p>

<p>A post on the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Xbox support page</a> details the adjusted prices for consoles, controllers, and headsets. These prices vary across the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other territories. We’ve included the US price changes in this article and recommend our international readers visit the support page to view the pricing updates for their respective countries.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Additionally, Xbox announces that certain upcoming first-party games will retail at $79.99 beginning this holiday season. This will apply to physical and digital versions. Xbox also confirms that existing releases will not see a price change. These software price adjustments are the first to follow Nintendo’s $80 pricing for its upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now, there are no confirmed Xbox first-party releases for the holiday season. We’ll likely find out which games will be the first to receive this updated pricing during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/09/xbox-games-showcase-and-the-outer-worlds-2-direct-set-for-june-8">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft comments on why it’s making these changes in the post, saying, “We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.”</p>

<p>Xbox’s price adjustments are the latest in a series of price increases for hardware and software across the industry due to current economic conditions (caused at least partially by the United States tariffs). Earlier this month, Sony <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">raised prices</a> for the PlayStation 5 console family in Europe and other non-US territories, citing “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates.”</p>

<p>Nintendo fans have also felt sticker shock at the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">$449/$499 pricing</a>. Nintendo delayed the US pre-order date for the Switch 2 in response to a round of US tariffs before announcing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">price increases</a> for Switch 2 accessories.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article first appeared on <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/soccer-mommys-guide-to-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 30</a> at <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Things</a>, a worker-owned site for  independent music journalism. If you like it, please check them out and <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consider subscribing</a>! &nbsp;</em></p><p>Back in October, the Nashville-based musician Sophie Allison—who makes beautiful and brooding indie rock as Soccer Mommy—became the envy of every&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>fan when she got her own avatar in the video game’s signature SNES style. It was a must if she was going to release “Abigail,” a writing-exercise-turned-single inspired by her preferred love interest—a purple-haired weeb hottie—in the wildly popular farm sim. While preparing her excellent fourth album&nbsp;<em>Evergreen</em>&nbsp;last year, Allison and her team got in contact with&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>creator Eric Barone early on. “We were originally hoping we could make something together but he didn’t have the time,” Allison tells me by phone. “He gave us permission to use the likeness, and we figured out how to use scenes that are already in the game with another designer.”</p><p>Set within&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, where stressful city living is traded for rehabbing the family farm and settling into a small town, the song’s video portrays a special heart event—a cutscene where two characters solidify their relationship—for Sophie and Abigail at a rock show. “That’s actually a heart event for the character Sam,” she says. “Sam, Sebastian, and Abigail have a band, and you take a bus to their concert and they give you a shoutout. Sorry to kick you out, Sam, but I thought that’d be really cute for me and Abigail.”&nbsp;</p><p>The clip’s true-to-game details—like knowing that Abigail loves chocolate cake and hanging out in the graveyard at night—made it clear that Soccer Mommy is a serious&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>fan. And with a highly social game like&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>, there are various ways to be hardcore that don’t involve a typical mission or sense of competition. “I love the dating aspect,” Allison says. “I know that’s not the point of the game, but as a Gemini, it’s the most fun part for me. I like dating a lot of people in a low stakes kind of way.”&nbsp;</p><p>In that way and so many others,&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>reminds Soccer Mommy of&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, the whimsical ’90s farm sim she adored as a kid. “These kinds of games are really an escape if you’re feeling overwhelmed—I feel this way about Pokémon too,” she adds. “You can just disappear into this little world that’s so positive and nurturing. As much as I loved&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, it’s missing an element of deeper characterization that&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>does so well. I’m not the hugest video game person, but&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>&nbsp;<em>Valley&nbsp;</em>totally changed what I think a video game can even be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Below, Soccer Mommy and I go deep on the ins and outs of&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>. Spoilers ahead.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s4SWK4DH6ZU?feature=oembed" height="399" width="710" title="Soccer Mommy - Abigail (Official Music Video)"></iframe></p><p><strong>Hearing Things: I have to imagine some of your fans got into the game after the “Abigail” video. If somebody were just starting&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>, what would be your initial tips?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sophie Allison: When you’re first picking your farm, I really love the beach farm. It’s super pretty, and I like having water. I also like the river farm for that reason. When you start the game, spend the first couple days clearing the farm. I think that’s the most important thing, because it gets really annoying and frustrating if you’re starting to do other things and you still have to clear and prep the farm. Wear out your energy. Do the farm. Go meet people—that’s my big tip. Talk to everyone, try to figure out everybody’s likes and interests, just explore and get it all figured out. Then get to work on the community center as quickly as you can.</p><p><strong>Do you have a sense of how many hours you’ve logged on the game?</strong></p><p>I have no idea because I’ve played on both Xbox and Switch. I’ve been playing it for years, and I’ve gone through a lot of files. My longest-running farm is pretty fleshed out, though. It’s very designed, it’s all super automated, I’ve got my slimes and everything. But honestly, now I spend most of my time on the island.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wait, what island?</strong></p><p>There’s an island you can get to eventually, like after you finish the community center tasks. You can repair Willy’s boat and he’ll take you to this place called Ginger Island, and there’s more stuff out there to uncover. That’s a fairly recent update. Whenever there’s an update I find myself going back to&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>, checking out more places. I go through intense phases with it.</p><p><strong>It really does become like an event in one’s life, taking over all your free time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You know, I go out on tour, and I’m very busy, and I just work and live in tour world, and then I come home and, like, I have no job anymore. And my friends have jobs. So what do I do? I go work on the farm.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your job becomes farming. So when I play I’m partial to farming, fishing, and foraging. I’m less into mining and combat. Do you have a preference there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I like to do it all, to be honest. I get really into one thing for a minute, and then once I’ve completed some tasks and leveled up, I move on. At a certain point it becomes really easy to check out of farming, because you can make sprinklers for all your watering. I definitely like to get myself set up with that and with animals early on, and try to build that up. But I do like the mines. The one thing I have actually never done on the game in completion is… have you gotten to the desert yet?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Oh yes, the Calico Desert.</strong></p><p>The mine there is&nbsp;<em>hard</em>. I’ve gotten down kind of far in it, but I haven’t done the entire thing because it’s just so draining. My favorite part, really, is dating. If I’m being honest, that’s the best part of the game to me. It’s extremely cute to be able to give people things and figure out what they like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s funny, when I got back on the dating apps a couple of years ago, I had&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&nbsp;in my interests on Hinge, and it became such an entry point for people to ask: Who’s your favorite Stardew spouse? You can kind of glean things about people’s tastes. You have a whole song about Abigail, but if you’re not marrying her in the game, who are you courting?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I like to marry Sebastian because he’s gone a lot, but I get a little tired of that. Usually I divorce him. Sam was the first one I ever married. I had just started playing, and I didn’t really go talk to a bunch of people. I was just like,&nbsp;<em>oh, he plays music</em>. Even in the game, I don’t know why I gravitated towards that. I’ve married a lot of them and then divorced them really quickly. I like Leah a lot, though.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I like Leah, too. I like that she’s an artist and she’s always talking about spicy food.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She’s also the only character in the game where, if you’re playing as a girl she'll already be gay, which is very cool. I like her energy, and there's some drama in her heart events when an ex shows up. I also love Alex, he has a great plotline, though I’ve never played all the way through with him.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m gonna tell you who I don’t like: I don’t connect with Maru at all. A lot of people really love Emily, and I like the character a lot, but similar to Maru, her heart events are just not exciting. They’re too random, and you're not even really involved with a lot of them, which doesn't do it for me. I don’t love Elliott. I just don’t care about whatever he’s got going on, and I feel the same way about Harvey. He bores the hell out of me in a romantic sense. The whole plotline of him like, wanting to fly or something?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I have to admit, I’m a sucker for a nerd and started off marrying Harvey. But he’s so boring. The only thing he seems to like is wine, so I just give him lots of wine.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yeah, he likes coffee too, which makes it pretty easy. I always picked Shane in the beginning, because he has a nice progression. But I didn’t like being married to him.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Well, is he still an alcoholic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When you marry him, he kind of cleans up and has a real passion for the chickens. It’s very endearing.</p><p><strong>That’s cute. Do you have a favorite crop or a favorite season?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Autumn and summer. I truly love pumpkins, even though those do not keep growing. The cactus fruits are kind of cool, and I do blueberries a lot. I try to have variety, try to switch it up so that I can store a lot of different crops. But I’m super into getting milk and making cheese, aging the cheese, aging the wine, making jam, making caviar—all that artisan stuff.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stardew Valley Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ot7uXNQskhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em> </em><strong>Have you ever “sold out” and gone the JojaMart route? It’s giving Amazon, obviously.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I haven’t actually, because it sounds so awful. It also seems like it is not beneficial to you or the town, which I think is a great message. I’ve been thinking,&nbsp;<em>should I do a file where I try this?</em>&nbsp;But I feel like that would not be a file I enjoyed playing for too long. Also, I'm married to the daughter of the general store owner. I can't just be going right to the big-box competition.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you ever feel weird because Abigail lives at home and kind of seems like a teen?</strong></p><p>I like to imagine that none of them are teenagers. They’re eligible bachelors. I’m picturing she’s 25 and living at home because she’s kind of a freak who just wants to play video games and drums. She’s a Twitch trainer. She’s like,&nbsp;<em>I’ve got to get out of here because my parents are driving me crazy</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, in&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, if you did not marry eligible people, they would marry someone else eventually. Like if you waited too long, everyone would couple off. You could have these—not just heart events for your character, but you had rival heart events as well, where you could see the person you like, having a moment with someone else. That used to boil my blood when I was a child, because I didn’t realize that I was not inside of the video game. I wish&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>would do that, because I’d love to see my jealousy come out for a video game character again. I need to be like, fighting and conquering over someone. I would never want to do something like that in my real life, but in the video game, I want all the drama.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, there is a cutscene in&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>&nbsp;where if you’re dating everyone, you can walk into the bar and they’ll all be mad at you. It lasts a couple days. Or if you’re married and you start giving gifts to someone else of the same gender [as the spouse], they’ll sometimes be like, “I heard you gave a gift to so and so today.”</p><p><strong>You’re not the first person who has noted its similarities to&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>, like urging me to play that if I like&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>. But I’m hesitant—how could&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>top this?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No, you’ve got to wait till you’ve finished&nbsp;<em>Stardew&nbsp;</em>all the way through at least once. If you’re still wanting more, then you can go play&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>. Particularly, I really love&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-z-RaxFxWE&amp;ref=hearingthings.co" target="_blank"><em><u>Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town</u></em></a>, which is for Game Boy Advance. But they actually just released a version of&nbsp;<em>Friends of Mineral Town&nbsp;</em>on Switch. That’s what I played growing up. It’s not obviously as in-depth [as&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>] but it’s still very cute and there’s plenty to do. But also, you can accidentally kill your animals in&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon</em>. Like if they’re sick and you don’t care for them, they’ll just die. It’s very sad. There’s a little funeral and the priest chews you out.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wow, that’s bleak. Honestly, it’s wild how these kinds of games actually make me appreciate nature more.&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>’s like the most outside inside-kid game.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s so beautiful. There’s something satisfying about it, partially because it’s so much about tidying and organizing and doing these tasks, but also because the scenery and the music are&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25VXUaF66Jc&amp;ref=hearingthings.co" target="_blank"><u>truly so gorgeous</u></a>. It can make me feel so nostalgic for being in the mountains, and it’s so comforting because it reminds me of my childhood a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have any favorite music from&nbsp;<em>Stardew</em>?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I like the spring and the fall themes on the farm. Those little melodies on a loop are just so catchy and actually have interesting chord progressions. You can get a jukebox at one point and change the music too, which I love. It all sounds very flute-y, almost like jaunty chamber music. Video game music like that is my favorite, like my ringtone is the&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>opening theme. I just find it really calming and peaceful.</p><p><em>Jill Mapes is one of the founders of Hearing Things.

			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco released the latest trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-pc-system-requirements/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, the multiplayer co-op action game due to launch on May 30, 2025.</p>
<p>It's a 10-minute presentation providing an overview of all the basics you'll need to know when jumping into Nightreign, so for the most part, it was a lot of information we've already heard, but we did also get a few new gameplay clips we hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>The presentation was broken into five parts. The first focused on the world of Limveld, which is said to be an ancient world that used to thrive thanks to the power of the gods, now eroding thanks to the terrible night that you and your fellow Nightfarers contend with.</p>
<p>It also talked about how Limveld's layout will change each time you fly in for a new session, and showed some of the different areas we've not yet seen through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">network tests</a>.</p>
<p>The second part focused on the different enemies you'll face, and how you should try to survive the night, whether you focus on leveling up through farming standard enemies, going for bigger, more challenging threats, finding hidden and treasured gear, or all of the above. Regardless of how you prepare for the final big fight against a Nightlord, the best advice the trailer gives is to have a plan before flying into Limveld.</p>
<p>The third chunk of the presentation focuses on the actual Nightfarers you play as in Elden Ring Nightreign. We know there will be eight of them available at launch, and those who have already been in the network test have had the chance to play as four of them: Duchess, Guardian, Wylder, and Recluse. Interestingly, the overview trailer only showed three more, and didn't even talk about one of them.</p>
<p>We saw a little more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-elden-ring-nightreign-trailer-shows-off-ironeye-class/">Ironeye</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjAdGN4-lvU">Raider</a>, two characters who have each received a separate character trailer, and we saw quick clips of Executor, though nothing was discussed about Executor. The overview skips over the Executor and the fact that eight Nightfarers are mentioned, but only seven are shown. It'll be interesting to see when this eighth character is revealed and if there's an obvious reason why FromSoftware would leave it for last. There was a quick shot at someone who could be the eighth character, but it's unclear if that's who they are or if they are an NPC you'll meet in the Roundtable Hold.</p>
<p>The fourth section was a look at the Roundtable Hold, which we know is your base of operations between night raids. It's where you'll level up permanent traits with what you've found on your raids, and we now know it'll be where you can acquire a few familiar cosmetics. Outfits that hearken back to previous FromSoftware games, like the Solaire knight's armor from Dark Souls, will be available to unlock.</p>
<p>Lore hunters will also be happy to know that through gameplay, you'll recover "<em>Fragments of Lost Memory</em>" regarding each Nightfarer, providing hints about who these Nightfarers were before they joined the fight, and why they joined in the first place. What you see in these fragments, and what you learn in the conversations you'll have with other Nightfarers, will also lead to new objectives when you enter into a new session. Completing those objectives will help to reveal who the Nightfarers are fully.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has already made it clear that the world of Nightreign is separate from the world of Elden Ring, but it'll be interesting to see if there's any more information that suggests an overlap or discusses the world of The Lands Between as we've known it for the last three years.</p>
<p>Finally, the overview touched on the Nightlords, the day 3 bosses you'll face at the end of each session, and showed off some intense gameplay of what those fights will look like.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, the overview is a great resource if you want a short look at what you'll need to know when jumping into Elden Ring Nightreign, but it also has some glaring absences that make it more of a tease for what's to come in the full game.</p>
<p>Nightreign is the first multiplayer-focused game by FromSoftware since the studio's popularity took off after Dark Souls began to take over the world. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/">Elden Ring is its most successful release yet</a> with over 30 million sold, and everyone is waiting to see how the studio fares in the multiplayer world, and if the success of their single-player games can translate to online multiplayer games.</p>

The Game of the Year race just got wide open again as well, though I’m skeptical that <em>GTA VI </em>was ever a lock—it’s been so long since the last one that people often conflate the enduring popularity of<em> GTA Online</em> with the critical reception of the base game’s open-world story campaign. </p><p>Speaking of time, <em>GTA V</em> launched back in 2013.

The team has waited this long to release a new entry in the series it makes complete sense to wait an extra six months than potentially ship with any outstanding performance concerns or crunch to meet an arbitrary deadline. Unfortunately for PC players, this means it might take that much longer for the game to get ported off consoles. Especially with the PlayStation 6 remastered editions just around the corner. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/epic-games-store-completely-eliminates-revenue-fees-for-smaller-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>It has been over six years since Epic <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/epic-undercuts-steam-with-new-store-that-gives-devs-more-money/">started undercutting Steam's 30 percent revenue share for developers</a>, asking for just 12 percent of sales on its then-new Epic Games Store. Now, Epic is going even further by reducing those fees to zero for a game's first $1 million in annual sales.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">newly announced fee structure</a> will go into effect in June, Epic said, and will apply to a developer's revenue on a "per app" basis. After the first $1 million in annual sales, apps will be charged the usual 12 percent fee for listing on the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Epic has offered a financial break to smaller developers. Back in 2011, the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/02/no-royalties-on-unreal-development-kit-until-5000-in-sales/">eschewed royalty payments for the first $50,000 in sales</a> for projects made with the newly free Unreal Development Kit. By 2020, that royalty-free grace period for Unreal Engine projects <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/unreal-engine-is-now-royalty-free-until-a-game-makes-a-whopping-1-mill/">was increased to cover the first $1 million in lifetime sales</a> for a project.</p>
<h2>Looking out for the little guy?</h2>
<p>Epic's focus on the low end of the gaming revenue scale is something of an inverse of Valve's fee structure on Steam. In 2018, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/steam-now-gives-its-biggest-developers-a-bigger-cut-of-the-revenue/">cut its default 30 percent revenue share</a>&nbsp;to 25 percent, but only for lifetime per-game earnings in excess of $10 million. Valve's fee goes down again to 20 percent after a game hits $50 million in lifetime sales.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">officially has a release date</a>, but it's not the one players had expected. It'll arrive on current-gen consoles on May 26, 2026, as Rockstar and Take-Two confirmed that GTA VI was delayed outside its initial Fall 2025 release window.</p>
<p>Despite Rockstar having a history of delaying its biggest games at least once or twice before they finally release, Take-Two boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-still-scheduled-to-release-this-fall-take-two-full-expects-to-support-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Strauss Zelnick's stalwart reassurances</a> that Grand Theft Auto VI would release in Fall 2025 had plenty of fans believing that this time would be different. And while it very well could have been, a comment from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier indicates that Rockstar knew this delay would happen for some time now.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">BlueSky,</a> Schreier indicates that, per conversations he's had with Rockstar employees, there has been no real chance of Grand Theft Auto VI releasing in Fall 2025 "<em>for a very long time now</em>."</p>
<p>The uplifting part to this is that Rockstar developers knew the delay was coming not just because it would have been too much work to get it done by Fall 2025, but because there's actually what Schreier describes as "<em>a real desire</em>" from Rockstar to not put the development team through an awful period of crunch.</p>
<p>"<em>Nobody I've talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now,</em>" Schreier wrote. "<em>Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. </em><em>GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer.</em>"</p>
<p>Avoiding putting the development team through an awful crunch phase and ensuring they have the time to make GTA VI as good as possible, without burning themselves out, is a solid reason for delaying. If Rockstar has turned that corner on crunch, it can hopefully be a strong example for other studios to follow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-playstation-follow-xboxs-price-increase-and-what-does-it-mean-for-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Now Nintendo and Xbox have already made the jump to $80 games, surely it's only a matter of time until PlayStation follows.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday">a suite of price hikes to its consoles and accessories</a>, plus a price increase for games to $80 USD confirmed coming later this year. The repercussions of this announcement is seismic and far-reaching in ways we have yet to see, and will have major consequences not just for third-party game prices, but likely PlayStation consoles as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is not an exaggeration to say this is the most expensive gaming has been since the 1990s. Microsoft announced that its lowest tier console, the Xbox Series S with a little over 500GB of storage now costs $380 USD. That’s less than $20 cheaper than a PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Astro Bot bundle on the PlayStation store. The 2TB Xbox Series X is now $729, which is about $30 more expensive than a PS5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Xbox move is on the heels of Nintendo’s Switch 2 announcement, which created waves not only <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">due to the console price of $450 for the Switch 2</a> itself, but the $80 price tag on certain first-party games like Mario Kart World. Nintendo, which previously priced its games at $60, skipped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-full-priced-first-party-games-will-be-70">the $70 mark drawn by Xbox and PlayStation</a> at the start of this generation (which in itself caused huge uproar) and went straight to $80. Now Xbox will follow that lead this holiday when first party Xbox games will also hit that threshold, and it’s hard to believe the price increases will stop there.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Will PlayStation Games Increase to $80?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on Sony to see whether it will follow the path led by Nintendo and Xbox, but I’m almost certain it’ll announce price hikes in the coming weeks. The rising cost of manufacturing and the tariffs from the US Trade War means that Sony must raise prices just to deal with the economic realities of the world today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypothetically, even if Sony were less impacted by the tariffs than Microsoft — which is almost certainly the reason why Xbox raised prices — Sony has the more successful hardware, and to not raise prices in the face of competition from both Xbox and Nintendo is leaving money on the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But more than console prices, it’s even more certain that Sony will raise the price of its first-party PlayStation games. The company has repeatedly touted the inherent value of its games line-up as a valuable experience worth a premium. There is no world in which Sony views its first-party games as being worth less than Xbox first-party games given their continued critical and commercial success. So if Xbox is raising first-party game prices, I think Sony will too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even precedent for Sony’s steadfast belief in the value of its first-party IP. The company stood by its decision to release Housemarque’s last game, Returnal, at $70 despite widespread criticism from fans who’ve previously known Housemarque for delivering great-but-smaller experiences direct to digital. Knowing what we know about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs"><u>how much it even costs to make Sony’s biggest first-party games</u></a>, an $80 price tag feels inevitable.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Death of Physical Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the increase in console and game prices, the price hikes reflect an opportunity for corporations to fast-track something they’ve been working towards for a long time: A move to subscription services and digital games, and the end of physical media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital games and subscription services owned and operated by platform holders like PlayStation and Xbox earn more in revenue than physical media and used game sales. That is why PlayStation and Xbox have made such heavy investments into promoting services like PlayStation Plus and especially Xbox Game Pass. As far as we know, Xbox Game Pass is not receiving a price hike (it did of course <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say"><u>go up in price the middle of 2024</u></a>), and with Xbox games soon to be $80, its value for the price-conscious consumer may as well have increased given the savings subscribing to Game Pass earns compared to buying even a single first-party Xbox game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of physical media, I’ve been watching this trend of funneling users towards digital services and sales with dismay, and the price hikes on physical media might take us towards an all-digital future even faster than anticipated by anyone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What Does This Mean for GTA 6 and Everyone Else?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The handbreaks are well and truly off. Even before the trade war and since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023, the games industry has had to reckon with declining profits and increasing development costs. Questions around whether the current pricing of games and consoles were sustainable began to circulate among industry insiders and analysts, and they have now manifested in higher costs for consoles like the PlayStation 5 Pro and Switch 2, as well as first-party games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With first-party companies firmly moving towards raising its prices, the likely final signal to confirm whether this pricing increase is a blip or a permanent move is GTA 6 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">when it eventually comes out in 2026</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea that Grand Theft Auto 6 could be priced at $100 began as an analyst’s prediction, but quickly gained traction among the wider games industry. After all, with billions of dollars poured into GTA 6’s development, and over a decade of time spent on making the game, Take-Two is looking to maximise profits from what is very easily the most-anticipated game of the decade, perhaps ever. In the past, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has said games are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publisher-ceo-thinks-videogame-prices-are-very-very-low-for-what-they-offer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>priced “very, very low” compared</u></a> to the value they offer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Rockstar finally reveals the release date for Grand Theft Auto 6 I’m extremely confident it will cost $80 <em>at the minimum</em>. Of course, that doesn’t mean that everything will cost $80 – games like Helldivers 2 and more recently Split Fiction have proved there’s huge interest in lower priced games that fall just outside the traditional triple-A blockbuster sphere – and many will sacrifice playing a game on day one if it means they can pick it up in a sale a few weeks or months down the line. But one thing’s for sure, prices are only going in one direction in the future and for many of us, that means we’ll have to be a little more choosy over what we buy and play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em><br>

What did you expect?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It was, perhaps, inevitable: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">Rockstar has delayed GTA 6 to May 2026</a>. Confirmation comes from an unceremonious statement that was devoid of launch platforms or any new trailer. Not even a new screenshot accompanied the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rockstar games have been here before, of course. The legendary developer has form when it comes to delaying its games, so this delay to GTA 6 perhaps comes as little surprise. Still, those fans have reacted with a mix of disappointment, relief, and a realization that the internet is now set for another 12 months of rampant, often nonsensical speculation about all things GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTA 6 subreddit</a>, which has been the source of so many of the wild conspiracy theories surrounding the game, its trailers, and when it might come out, has exploded following the news.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ffs, Fuck Rockstar, at least give us screenshots,” MyNameIsToFuOG said, reflecting a general disappointment that Rockstar failed to soften the blow of GTA 6’s delay without any fresh look at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>At least give us a screenshot, this is ridiculous even for R*,” added Abvk0. “1.5 years of silence just to drop a delay news without even showing us bread crumbs of the game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At least we have a date now, I don't mind a delay if it means the game is gonna be good,” said the more philosophical bl00nded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s Rockstar bro. What did you expect? Also, I really doubt it will release on May 26, they will delay it more,” said a somewhat concerned Puzzleheaded-Hunt731.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also speculation Rockstar may release GTA 6 on PC at the same time as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, now the game has been delayed to 2026. “I hope that means that a PC version is also coming in 2026 and not 2027,” said Kiwibom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“2026 console release, late 2027 PC release, 2028 new-gen console release,” predicted Velkoadmiral.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s own commenters had plenty to say about the GTA 6 delay, too, with user BSideleau slamming the console generation thus far in a scathing post:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Surprising no one. It will be a final game of this tepid generation. What a let down. I have never felt more grifted than by Microsoft and Sony this generation. Both consoles are more 0.5 updates from the previous generation than true next gen consoles, yet they expected us to pay MORE for them. Quit letting them get away with it. Demand better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also plenty of talk about how much GTA 6 will cost. With both Nintendo and Microsoft going to $80 for some of their games, fans are bracing themselves for an $80 GTA 6. Some believe it could cost even more, going up to $100 perhaps, if the new GTA Online is included.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its statement, Rockstar said “we look forward to sharing more information with you soon.” Could this mean Trailer 2 isn’t far off? Fans certainly hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 isn’t just expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, fans expect it to be one of the greatest games ever made. Under that enormous pressure, the developers at Rockstar and parent company Take-Two will be desperate to ensure the game launches at the highest possible quality level. With that in mind, this delay feels like it was always going to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gta-vi-will-miss-2025-after-all-new-target-is-may-26-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Rockstar's highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will finally launch on May 26, 2026, Rockstar Games said in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">a Friday morning announcement</a>.</p>
<p>That means the game will miss the "2025" release window that the developer announced alongside <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">the game's first trailer in late 2023</a>. That delay is needed, Rockstar said, so the company can use "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected," Rockstar wrote in its announcement. "The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game."</p>
<h2>A long wait gets longer</h2>
<p>While disappointing for franchise fans, today's official announcement of a delay hasn't exactly been unexpected. Insider sources have been reporting that the 2025 release target looked unlikely <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831">for well over a year now</a>.</p>
<p>"Nobody I’ve talked to at Rockstar has believed Fall 2025 was a real window for a very long time now," Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x">wrote on Bluesky</a> this morning. "Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch. GTA VI slipping to 2026 has seemed inevitable for months if not longer."</p>
<p>The new planned launch date of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> now falls a full 4,634 days after the Sept. 17, 2013 launch of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. By contrast, there was just a 1,967-day gap between the release of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and the prior release <em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em>, which <em>also</em> launched on the PS3 and Xbox 360 on April 29, 2008.</p>

Shares of Take-Two have slid by about 8% so far today to around $219, wiping out billions of market cap for the video game publisher.</p><p>Take-Two anticipated investors having questions about the delay and its impact on the company's financial outlook, so it released a statement reiterating that the company still expects "sequential increases in, and record levels of" net bookings (i.e. revenue) for Fiscal 2026 and Fiscal 2027.</p><p>GTA 6's new release date of May 26, 2026 falls in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2027 (April 1 2026-March 31 2027). Previously, the game was scheduled to release in Fall 2025, which fell in Take-Two's Fiscal Year 2026 (April 1, 2025-March 31, 2026).</p><p>While GTA 6 is no longer coming this year, Take-Two's labels still have Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 coming this year, in addition to its roster of sports titles.</p><p>Take-Two will release its next earnings report on May 15, and it's expected the company will face numerous questions about the impact of GTA 6's delay on Take-Two's earnings outlook.</p><p>While Take-Two's share price fell today, it's still up around 80% in the past five years. In February 2025, Take-Two's share price <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parent-companys-stock-reaches-all-time-high-and-this-could-be-why/1100-6529336/" data-ref-id="1100-6529336">reached a record high</a> following Take-Two's announcement that GTA 6 remained on track for release in 2025 and that the company had exceeded earnings expectations. Now that GTA 6 has been delayed, the stock price is moving in the other direction, at least for now. Stock prices tend to fluctuate significantly during a major news event and then moderate soon after.</p><p>For its part, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said Take-Two "fully" supports Rockstar's decision to take additional time to "realize their creative vision for GTA 6." Reporter Jason Schreier said the delay was in part to help Rockstar's developers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">avoid a "brutal crunch" period</a>.

Rockstar has an employee bonus program that can lead to big payouts. In addition to an annual bonus, developers are paid performance-based bonuses in the years of game launches. For the original Red Dead Redemption, for example, Rockstar workers earned five-figure bonuses, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Kotaku.</a></p><p>For Take-Two's latest reporting period, running October-December 2024, <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two paid out more than $100 million in bonuses to developers</a>, referred to as "internal royalties" by the company's accounting.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest on GTA 6.</p>

		<p>On 8th May, Paradox Interactive will reveal their next grand strategy game, dubbed Project Caesar. The reveal will take place at 5PM UK time, 6PM CEST, 12PM ET, 9AM PT, and can be watched here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Caesar - Official Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is being created at Studio Tinto, Paradox’s Barcelona-based team that was founded back in 2020 and put under the direction of studio lead Johan Andersson, who’s had an integral role in leading development of many of Paradox’s biggest games through the eras.</p>
<p>Paradox has been lightly previewing the game in a series of Tinto Talks developer diaries, drawing in community feedback on feature ideas, game systems and historical research. Now it’s time to completely unfurl what Project Caesar will be.</p>

<p>So, what will Project Caesar be? Will be it be an original franchise or a sequel to one of Paradox’s main pillars? Being Project Caesar could refer to a Roman period game – last explored by Paradox in 2019’s Imperator: Rome – but that would probably be a bit on the nose. Meanwhile, Hearts of Iron IV is now 9 years old and Europa Universalis IV is coming up on its 12th anniversary.</p>

		<p>It’s not been a great week out in game journalist land, and our thoughts are with the staff at Polygon and Giant Bomb as they work out what might come next. Here at TSA, we’ve continued to play games, and I’ve been getting into Revenge of the Savage Planet, making a start on the extra-terrestrial adventure with a little help from Tef. Alongside that, I’ve continued to play Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which has become my chill-out game, alongside a batch of other things including Mycopunk and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/unbeatable-is-a-rhythm-action-narrative-adventure-thats-creating-its-own-genre/">Unbeatable</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> was so early with his WWP, that I forgot to ask everyone else, but he says that, “Following a brief spell in Cyrodiil (I intend to return to Oblivion Remastered in the very near future, mind) I once again picked up my Tantō and Kanabō to finish off Assassin’s Creed Shadows. My impressions remain very much the same though unlocking a few late game abilities and gear perks definitely made combat more interesting. A couple of soft twists kept the story enticing enough for me to see it through, but the ending is somewhat abrupt and predictably open-ended, giving Ubisoft ample opportunity for new storylines and expansions.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Of course. He’s not the only one sticking with his gaming happy place though as <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing The Witcher 3 where he’s once again near the end of the main quest. Then he’ll just have Blood &amp; Wine to go. That’s not all though, telling us, “I’ve also started a playthrough of Tell Me Why. Finished the first chapter and I’m intrigued to see what happens next.”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has continued to play through Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which he says, “is excellent and also taking ages for me to finish for some reason.”</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> has kept things interesting by playing loads of random things! He told us, “Some Bayonetta 2, Mark of the Ninja (probably the best stealth game I’ve every played), a spot of AC Shadows, a little Atomfall, and also two roguelites for review; Kiborg and Spiritfall – phew!”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also had a week made up of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, telling us, “I’ve just finished the first act and it made me feel things.” He continues, “I’ve also spent some time with a couple of indies which should be reviewed for early next week. Finally I’ve now completed all the galaxy challenges in Lego Skywalker and just have the film levels to 100% but my eldest wants to multiplay those so trying to organise the time to do that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been and needed a co-op buddy this week, first with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/28/mycopunk-preview-a-co-op-shooter-for-all-you-fun-guys-out-there/">preview impressions of Mycopunk’s demo</a>, and later with a good dose of Revenge of the Savage Planet. He also shared some hands on thoughts about the modern wargaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/broken-arrow-preview-would-you-like-to-play-a-wargame/">Broken Arrow.</a></p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung Is Releasing a 3D Monitor That Feels Like a Beefed-Up Nintendo 3DS Screen]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/technology/features/samsung-is-releasing-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-is-releasing-a-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-a-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen.1179642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/technology/features/samsung-is-releasing-3d-monitor-that-feels-like-beefed-up-nintendo-3ds-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I remember as a kid, the Nintendo 3DS absolutely floored me. 3D effects could jump out of handheld screens? It was magical, but also something that I couldn't imagine scaling up well.</p>

<p>Then Samsung put forth its new gaming monitor lineup, featuring the Odyssey 3D. This glasses-free monitor presents similarly to the 3DS's top screen but in 4K at 165Hz.</p>

<p>Introduced last year at CES, this screen adds a sense of depth to your games and YouTube videos. It sounded a little gimmicky to me when I first heard about it, so I had to try it out for myself to see if it's worth the hype.</p>



<h2>The Samsung Odyssey 3D Monitor Breaks the Fourth Wall</h2>

<p>I visited Samsung's offices in Bellevue, WA to get some hands-on time with the Odyssey 3D (the G90XF model). Almost immediately, I was surprised by how good the 3D effect looked. It took a second to adjust to my eyes, but once it did, the sense of the depth made me feel like I could reach into the screen, almost like an aquarium or diorama.</p>

<p>With two stereoscopic cameras at the top of the bezel, the monitor tracks your eyes to optimally adjust the parallax effect. Every now and then, I'd look away, then look back, and within seconds the effect readjusted.</p>

<p>I panned my head in all directions around the monitor to test how adaptable the eye tracking was, and as long as I didn't move too fast and was within range, it would maintain the 3D effect.</p>

<p>There's a distinction between the two kinds of games that will work with this monitor though. Some games are co-developed with the Odyssey 3D in mind, like <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=tiQlBehz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-khazan.jpg?itok=kfis3896 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's hard to capture with my phone's camera, but the 3D effects really pop out here, especially that giant flower in the foreground.</figcaption></figure><p>The 3D effects stood out to me here, with the snow effects especially looking—and feeling—like I'm looking into a snow globe (with lots blood and action). <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lies-of-p-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Lies of P</em></a> is also slated to receive this co-developed treatment later this summer.</p>

<p>The other kinds of games are certified by Samsung to work with the 3D monitor, though the 3D effect isn't as built into the games. These titles include <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-review" rel="nofollow">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/palworld-preview" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a></em>, and the <em>Grand Theft Auto Trilogy</em> remasters.</p>

<p>It's hard to describe, but the 3D effect didn't feel as pronounced in the other games I tried out compared to <em>Khazan</em>. It felt more like a filter applied after the fact, instead of something from the ground up. It was still pretty good though, and it made things pop more than it usually would in a more classic experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=XkGehlxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-odyssey-3d-goku.jpg?itok=DsGK00-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here, with the camera misaligned, it's easy to see "double" here instead of the 3D image that both of your eyes would see in person.</figcaption></figure><p>Within the first year, Samsung is aiming to have 50 3D compatible games on its list (in total of both types). I was hoping to see a strategy game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/civilization-vii" rel="nofollow"><em>Civilization VII</em></a> on the demo station, since I was curious how that isometric perspective would feel in 3D. But maybe down the line, we'll see it come up.</p>

<p>In addition to gaming, the Odyssey 3D can transform normal videos into 3D using the power of AI. As long as the video doesn't have DRM (e.g. a Netflix stream) and is in full screen, the Realty Lab app can take care of the rest. It can even take stereoscopic videos on YouTube and layer them into one 3D image.</p>

<p>I'd personally want to do more testing with this 3D conversion technology, because for some videos, it worked nicely, like a 4K scene from <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>. For other videos, like a stereoscopic POV rollercoaster, I could see double every now and then instead of a "3D" image.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=OZmZod07 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-screenshot.jpg?itok=fcDPEzNx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could you imagine a game like this in 3D?</figcaption></figure><h2>The Power of 3D Gaming Is Heavy</h2>

<p>For all the games involved, what surprised me the most was the smoothness of the experience. There weren't any noticeable frame-rate dips, and the crisp 4K resolution made everything stand out in high detail. That was something I worried about, since the PC would have to run the game as is and also process the 3D aspect on top of that.</p>

<p>However, I'm also fully aware that the demo station I played on was likely decked out with high-end gear. For an optimal 3D experience at home, Samsung recommends an Intel i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 1700X or higher, with at least 32GB of DRR5 5600 RAM. For AI video conversion to 3D, you'll specifically need an RTX 3080 or better (sorry AMD fans).</p>

<p>For hardcore PC gamers, these specs might not be too far out of reach, but needless to say, 3D gaming isn't exactly for mass consumption. It's a luxury good for a luxury gamer, if the monitor's $1,999 price tag didn't give that away.</p>



<p>That's where I ultimately get hung up on the Odyssey 3D monitor. Was it a cool experience? Absolutely. Will every major AAA PC game come out with support for this one monitor? Only time will tell, but likely not. Even then, is it worth the high price of entry? That's something only you and your wallet can decide, but personally, I'm not sure it is.</p>

<p>When you look at what else you can buy for $2,000 in the PC gaming space—a new VR headset, a GPU upgrade, a nicer gaming chair—it's hard to justify a monitor that does a gimmick very well but only for a certain selection of games.</p>

<p>Even in the monitor market, some of the best competitors out there cost less than half of the Odyssey 3D and offer more arguably useful features, like higher refresh rates or OLED panels.</p>

<p>If the idea of 3D gaming appeals to you, I don't want to yuck your yum. The Odyssey 3D will answer your needs very well and then some. Just don't go bankrupt for it.</p>

Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1917860173722603707">acknowledged the issue</a> and released another update, V20.0.1, this morning, which fixes the problem.
