<p>Pineapple Express</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We reviewed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/suika_game">Suika Game</a> back when it released on Switch in 2023, giving it a 7/10 and calling it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/suika-game">"ripe little puzzler"</a>, and one that you can nab for less than £3. A good thing in this economy, we can all agree.</p>
<p>Now, fans of Suika's puzzling charms can dive into the game's equally colourful-looking sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/suika-game-planet">Suika Game Planet</a>, which is available to purchase right this very moment for both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suika-game-planet-switch-2/">US eShop</a> (cheers for the heads-up <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2026/01/06/us-suika-game-planet-now-available-in-nintendo-eshop/">MyNintendoNews</a>). It's priced at <strong>$3.75</strong> on Switch 2, and <strong>$2.99</strong> on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Sadly, there doesn't seem to be an upgrade path (though the game is pretty cheap anyway) and as things currently stand, the game is currently <em>only</em> available on the US eShop. We'll be sure to keep an eye out for it landing in other regions, if and when it does so.</p>
<p>This new sequel moves the breezy puzzle action to space for some intergalactic shenanigans that see you control the dropping of fruit into the centre of your screen in order to pair off and combo from your positioning of fruit types.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A new Suika Game is here from a new setting in space! Turn, target, and aim for the watermelon!</strong></p>
<p>Drop the fruits freely from any direction as ""Poppy"" flies 360° around the planet. Make fruits of the same type collide to make them ""evolve"" and aim to create watermelons for a high score!</p>
<p>Make a lot of fruits ""evolve"" to enter the new ""Super Evolution Time"" mode! Special background music, dramatic effects, and a bonus score bring the excitement to a peak!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Switch 2 version of the game also supports the console's GameShare function, allowing for up to four players to hash it out in competitive play which, given the style of the puzzling at hand, could get pretty intense and enjoyable. So that's a neat and meaningful addition, especially given the game's ultra-low price tag!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS has announced an expansion thanks to the simulator's widespread success, rendering the outfit "an actual game studio", in TVGS' own words.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/523111043238464175" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, TVGS now has a central office location in Sydney, and the studio has also been able to hire a new developer (whose name is Rob, if you're interested).&nbsp;</p><p>A new 3D and technical artist will also be recruited soon; TVGS says that by the end of 2026, there will "likely be four people working on <em>Schedule I</em>". That might not sound like much, but given that the game is essentially a solo effort right now, that's pretty impressive.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Schedule I </em>developer TVGS is doing pretty well for itself, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as revealing the new office, TVGS also says it's releasing a <em>Schedule I </em>patch next week, but don't get too excited; it'll mainly consist of "bug fixing and QoL improvements", in the studio's own words.</p><p>Following that update, the remainder of January will be spent "cleaning up the codebase" and bringing new developer Rob up to speed; TVGS says he's got to "catch up on 120k+ lines of code", so it's not going to be an easy job for him.</p><p>Once all of this is taken care of, TVGS says it will "get to work on the next update", but the studio says it's learned its lesson from prior update delays, so the next major patch for <em>Schedule I </em>won't be announced until TVGS is "confident we'll hit it on time".</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>Schedule I </em>is, well, there's no easy way to say this: it's a drug-dealing simulator that lets you peddle illicit substances to all and sundry. Clutch your pearls as you will.</p>
<p><em>Schedule I </em>has indeed proven very successful; at last count, it had a 24-hour Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">player peak</a> of over 30,000.

It’s the world’s first gamepad to use ultra-low latency Bluetooth, allowing it a sub-3ms response time, and the first accessory to launch under LG’s “Designed for LG Gaming Portal” program. But since it’s been developed in collaboration with LG, the Wolverine V3 BT can only achieve that ultra-low latency when used with compatible LG TVs running webOS 25. It works as a universal Bluetooth gamepad with any device supporting Bluetooth controllers, including other TVs, but it won’t get ultra-low latency when doing so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>It looks a lot like a Wolverine V3 Pro, but with LG’s gaming logo on the power button and TV controls on the D-pad.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>As a TV-first controller, the new Wolverine V3 BT has some living room-friendly features like a built-in mic and TV controls on its D-pad. The new controller is similar to the standard Wolverine V3 Pro, but it lacks hair-trigger lockouts or extra shoulder buttons. Also, it’s got two customizable rear paddle buttons instead of the usual four. While some of that is a downgrade, this controller gets one big upgrade: TMR sticks. The Hall effect sticks on the Wolverine V3 Pro are already anti-drift, but the TMR ones of the V3 BT should be more precise and less power hungry.</p><p>Pricing and availability are not yet finalized for the Wolverine V3 BT.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

It features dual RGB light strips in the top corners, a pair of THX-certified speakers with spatial audio (which can act as the rear channels in 5.1 or 7.1 audio setups), and six haptic motor actuators in the cushions to barrage your back and posterior with <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-sensa" rel="sponsored">Razer’s Sensa</a> rumble.</p><p>Razer took some of these building blocks from previously released chair accessories.

And Razer has done an RGB headrest before, with its illuminated logo on the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">Head Cushion Chroma</a>.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Nerdiest Gaming Chair to Rule Them All. Go ahead, Razer, trademark that.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I got to sit in the Project Madison chair for a brief demo at CES, and I can vouch for two of its three features being at least a little engaging: the speakers and haptics. Playing a quick round of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, I got a nice sense of immersion as I could hear around me without needing to wear headphones. And the different kinds of weapons and character abilities made for varying styles of rumble and haptic sensations in my back and tush.</p><p>But you can’t actually see the lighting while playing, unless you take your eyes off the screen and crane your neck. I had to take my colleague at their word that the chair was lighting up and matching the keyboard and mouse Chroma RGB. Perhaps it’s streamer bait, but at least your head doesn’t block the lights like with Razer’s asinine <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-chairs-accessories%2Frazer-head-cushion-chroma" rel="sponsored">RGB cushion</a>.</p><p>Razer isn’t disclosing a potential price range for Project Madison, but it would likely sit toward the top of its priciest offerings if it ever actually comes out. Company reps mentioned that last year’s heated and cooled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336722/razer-project-arielle-gaming-chair-heating-cooling-prototype-ces">Project Arielle</a> chair is not going to see a full release, and that’s due to the lofty price Razer would have to charge for it. That doesn’t bode well for Project Madison unless Razer diehards are really clamoring for a chair with all these features built in — but at least they’re features people actually have a history of adopting in modular form.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <title><![CDATA[Viture’s latest AR glasses are as competitive and pricey as ever]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on</link>
            <guid>1398283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Smart glasses company Viture had a busy 2025, releasing its solid Luma series of glasses and ensuring that its pro mobile dock is compatible with Nintendo’s Switch 2. Now it’s kicking off 2026 by debuting a new model at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/836627/ces-2026-news-gadgets-announcements">CES</a>, called The Beast, and it’s available to preorder now for $549 with shipping starting in February.</p><p>The price is high for a company known for undercutting Xreal’s glasses with most (but not all) of the same features. In some ways, the price hike is warranted; Viture has caught up with Xreal as it has three degrees of freedom support built-in, letting you anchor your screen in virtual space, or allowing the screen to smoothly follow your head movements. Previous models have required additional hardware or software.</p><p>The Beast’s 58-degree field of view is also impressive since it’s a six-degree improvement over Viture’s previous flagship model (Xreal 1S supports 52 degrees). If you want more than just three dimming options, which is what most smart glasses have offered, the electrochromic tint that The Beast uses offers <em>nine</em> levels of adjustment. This lets you see as much or as little of your surrounding environment as you desire. It also has an embedded camera that will unlock six degrees of freedom in some use cases in the future.</p><p>Depending on the person, those benefits might make The Beast’s $100 premium price worth it compared to the cheaper 1S. They are certainly nice additions, even if they’re not must-have features for the average user.</p><p>One unfortunate omission in The Beast is myopia adjustments. Previous Viture models have dials above each eye’s display to let you make minor tweaks to get a clearer image. Instead, The Beast comes in two sizes (regular and large), but you may need prescription lenses if you’re nearsighted. I, for one, am nearsighted, but I was still able to achieve clear results with some adjustments to the included nose pads.</p><p>If you’re deciding between The Beast and the 1S (or any other AR glasses), here are some specs and thoughts worth knowing: Both support up to 1200p resolution (though Viture says it’s coming after launch) and 120Hz refresh rate. They both have 2D-to-3D conversion features that aim to make content more immersive, though my first impression wasn’t positive with either set. The Beast weigh about 96 grams according to my kitchen scale, while the 1S weighs in at 86 grams (Viture told <em>The Verge</em> that this preproduction unit weighs about two grams more than the final production version). The weight difference is easy to notice, and tweaking the fit of The Beast was all but necessary with its included nose pads. The Xreal 1S’ weight distribution feels more comfortable.</p><p>Anecdotally, I’ve preferred how my games and movies look through Viture’s glasses, even though both brands claim to utilize Sony’s latest micro OLED screens. Text and details appear sharp on The Beast and 1S, though the contrast is richer with Viture’s model. If those who own Viture’s Luma Pro glasses were content with the field of view and not being able to easily anchor the video feed in virtual space, I’m not convinced that these are worth upgrading to. And while Xreal doesn’t have the upper hand on this model in a meaningful way spec-wise, the lower price and weight of the 1S will probably make it the more popular pick.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/855388/viture-beast-ar-smart-glasses-specs-price-hands-on]]></content:encoded>

It opens with Shuri lamenting how she lost her family after the events of </span><i><span>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</span></i><span>, and we also see Namor and members of the underwater Talokan kingdom looking broodily in the distance at…something. But the real highlight is when Shuri and M’Baku greet none other than the Thing himself, Ben Grimm.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Thing and the rest of the Fantastic Four were shown arriving on the MCU’s version of Earth after the events of </span><i><span>Thunderbolts*</span></i><span>, and in </span><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i><span>’ post-credits scene, we saw Doctor Doom taking an interest in Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s god baby, Franklin. We’re not sure yet how that results in the group hopping multiverses, but it is cool to see even the first glimpse of the First Family teaming up with the rest of the MCU.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first three teasers featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, the ex-Captain America who “retired” at the end of </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> and is now being dragged back into the scrap for probably deeply cynical, nostalgia-baiting reasons; Thor, who prays to his father that he will be able to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1clWprLC5Ak"><span>return to his daughter Love</span></a><span>; and the X-Men, who are also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-trailer-xmen-cyclops-charles-magneto-2000655923"><span>getting pulled into all this</span></a><span>. Again, no sign of Doctor Doom yet. Maybe there will be more teasers than initially believed? Or maybe we still have a while to wait for our first glimpse of RDJ as the ruler of Latveria.</span></p> <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>is coming to theaters on December 18.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-magsafe-charger-restocks-at-its-lowest-price-3-in-1-charging-station-for-apple-devices-2000656779</link>
            <guid>1398268</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-start="68" data-end="557">I have far too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, the mess of cables around my nightstand is starting to look like some kind of cyberpunk bird nest. It’s really my fault, though—I could easily fix this by getting a charging stand, like this Anker MagSafe charger, which would eliminate the chaos entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/"> Normally priced at $230, it’s now available for just $161 due to a limited-time 30% discount</a>. That’s a savings of $69 during the sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="559" data-end="588"><strong data-start="559" data-end="588">Perfect for Apple Devices</strong></h2>
<p data-start="590" data-end="882">This Anker MagSafe charging stand is designed specifically for modern Apple products. It’s made to work with newer iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watches that support wireless charging. The stand has three built-in wireless chargers, each designed for either your phone, watch, or AirPods case.</p>
<p data-start="884" data-end="1112">Before purchasing, make sure your devices are compatible with wireless charging. iPhones from the iPhone 12 onwards are all set, as are newer AirPods models. Older devices won’t work with this stand’s wireless charging features.</p>
<p data-start="1114" data-end="1587">What’s really impressive about this wireless charger is its speed. The stand can charge an iPhone 17 Pro to 50% in just 22 minutes, which is pretty fast for wireless charging. It provides 25W charging—better than most other wireless chargers in its class. You can leave your devices on the stand overnight, and they’ll be fully charged by morning. Alternatively, you can keep the stand at your desk while you work.</p>


<p data-start="1589" data-end="1817">The stand also features a display that shows the charging status of your devices and even a clock, making it a great addition to your nightstand. This allows you to easily check the time without lifting your head off the pillow.</p>
<p data-start="1819" data-end="2069">As with all Anker products, safety is a top priority. The MagSafe charging stand uses ActiveShield technology, which monitors temperatures over three million times per day to ensure your devices don’t overheat while charging, keeping everything safe.</p>
<p data-start="2071" data-end="2223">With the Anker MagSafe charging stand, you can clean up your nightstand and keep your devices charged without the mess of cables, all for a great price. There are two color options available. Choose either white or phantom gray. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. It is exactly $0.01 cheaper. But then again, pennies are no longer a thing anymore so I guess they are exactly the same. Get it now for $160.99 or $160.98 for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">That’s down from a starting price of $230, meaning you end up saving $69—equivalent to 30% off.</a></p>

            <guid>1398229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s already 2026? So that means it’s time for a new year of fresh new games, and a whole 12 months of lusting after the next big thing? Let’s get started then! One of the first big things for the year has to be Romeo Is A Dead Man, a hyper-kinetic, hyper-violent, hyper-insane new action title from the iconic Grasshopper Manufacture. This has already hopped onto a bunch of the TSA team’s radar, and this new story trailer gives you the lowdown in a typically Grasshopper-like way, which means it’s irreverent, weird and darkly funny. Go take a look!</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Story Introduction Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』ストーリー紹介編トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EryjLSG0x_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, I’m not too sure what the moral of this story is going to be. Don’t pick up women in the road? Don’t fall in love? Don’t let your grandfather shove technology down your eyeball that turns you into some sort of living-dead superhero? I’m not entirely sure whether SUDA51 and his team are in the habit of including morals or finger-wagging in their games, so I’m going to take it that the moral is going to be something about being faster, meaner and more violent than the bad guys, so you don’t end up being a doubly dead man. </p>
<p>Romeo Stargazer, a sheriff’s deputy, is the hero of this piece, but he doesn’t stay human for all that long by the look of things. He finds Juliet – because of course he does – in the middle of the road, and they fall in love. I’m hoping that there’s more Shakespearean asides for the English Lit fans in the back too, as the rest of the trailer opts instead to tell you about how Romeo dies at the hands of a White Devil, and how his grandfather, Professor Benjamin, saves him. Surely he should be Professor Montague? I suppose Benjamin is close enough to Benvolio. Just about.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s clear that the tone of Romeo Is A Dead Man is going to be all kinds of tongue-in-cheek and all kinds of raucous fun, as your living-dead hero takes his revenge on a series of creepy monsters.  </p>

<p>Romeo is a Dead Man releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam and Windows platforms) on February 11th, 2026.</p>
<p>You can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10016000">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/romeo-is-a-dead-man/9MXHH4JL4G76/0010">Xbox</a> right now!</p>

		<p>Creepy Jar’s newest survival game StarRupture has launched into Steam Early Access today, with a launch discount price of $15.99 / €15,99 / £13.59 / 51,99 zl, giving players the opportunity to survive and thrive on a hostile alien planet. Alongside the launch of StarRupture, Creepy Jar has shared a general early access roadmap of what players should expect over the next few months and further on.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZQywin8d2U8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ongoing improvements players should expect in StarRupture’s Early Access include the game’s performance, the building mechanics, the combat mechanics, the game world, and the user interface. Additional features will be more wildlife, custom game mode options with adjustable difficulty, a new travel mode to go between bases, a codex, controller support, new building features, new combat mechanics, and new ways to explore the world. New content that will be added in StarRupture will include new weapons, an expanded map, more corporation levels and associated rewards, new buildings, new resources, new locations and points of interest, new story elements, and a new forgotten engine. Creepy Jar will also be looking to balance the co-op gameplay, improve the cargo network, add accessibility options such as text size and better key rebinding, and dedicated servers. When StarRupture eventually releases into version 1.0 it will get a new biome, something called frost wave, the end game content, more story elements, and achievements. There is no specific timeline for any of this yet.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

			<p>Goichi <strong>"Suda51"</strong> and <strong>Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> require no introduction, as they have developed some of the quirkiest games ever released on PC and consoles. After working on new entries in the <em>No More Heroes</em> series and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/"><strong>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</strong></a></em>, the legendary game designer and his studio began working on <strong>Romeo is a Dead Man</strong>, their <strong>first IP in a very long time</strong>, which looked like a Suda51 game through and through, even <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture-studio-reveals-romeo-is-a-dead-man-coming-to-ps5-in-2026/">in its announcement trailer.</a></strong></p>



<p>The game's unmistakable feel was also evident in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-gamescom-hands-on-preview-subspace-emissary/"><strong>short demo I was able to check out during Gamescom 2025</strong></a>, with intense action and an overall artistic direction that I have found close to <strong>Quentin Tarantino's style</strong>, something I told Suda51 himself when I had the chance to speak with him about <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em>.</p>



<p>Besides saying that he <span>is often told this,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank"><strong>Suda51 also discussed</strong></a></span><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> how the game's story and setting were heavily inspired by Back to the Future and FBI TV shows.</strong></a> I couldn't see much of this influence in the Gamescom demo, but after playing through the game's first two chapters in a more relaxed setting, these influences are difficult to ignore. It is difficult not to notice how <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> has the potential to become <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">one of the best games ever made</strong> by the Japanese development studio.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Romeo-is-a-Dead-Man-Preview-01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Romeo is a Dead Man's story can get weird at times, but it's surprisingly engaging</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Suda51, "Romeo is a Dead Man" was inspired by a <strong>"what if" scenario from Back to the Future: what if Marty McFly died?</strong> What would have Doc Emmett Brown done? He would have gone back in time and saved Marty. And this is precisely what <strong>Benjamin Stargazer</strong> does to save his nephew Romeo, returning to the moment he was going to be killed by a mysterious creature, fitting him with the <strong>Dead Gear Life Support System</strong> to save his life.</p>



<p>This, however, creates a <strong>Time Paradox</strong> which shatters the space-time continuum, transforming reality into a <strong>chaotic multiverse</strong>. To restore the world, the <strong>FBI Space-Time Division</strong> recruits Romeo, who becomes an agent under the name of <strong>DeadMan</strong>. Traveling through space-time, Romeo will not only pursue some heinous space-time criminals, but also seek his girlfriend, <strong>Juliet</strong>, who appears to be connected to the major crisis that has disrupted the entire universe.</p>



<p>If this premise sounds a little confusing to you, you are not alone. In its first two story chapters, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Romeo is a Dead Man</em> feels like a mish-mash of very diverse concepts, where the aforementioned influences are blended with a gameplay formula that's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">markedly Suda51</strong>. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hack-and-slash</strong> experience is fairly straightforward, combining <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">melee and gun combat</strong> in a simple yet effective way, enriching both with unique mechanics such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloody Summer</strong> - an all-powerful attack that can be unleashed once enough blood has been gathered - <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the Bastards</strong> - special skills unleashed by friendly enemies with a lot of different offensive and support effects - and the ability to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">shoot weak points</strong> on certain enemies to deal massive damage.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210180216_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Boss fights in Romeo is a Dead Man are set to be one of the highlights of the experience</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the game's very first chapter is essentially the entirety of the Gamescom 2025 demo set in a swamp area ending with a boss fight against one of the many <strong>versions of Juliet</strong> roaming space time, it's the <strong>second chapter</strong> that proved to be the most surprising, to me. Following some story sequences aboard <strong>The Last Night</strong> ship, which serves as the central hub, rendered with a <strong>top-down view and 16-bit visuals</strong>, Romeo is sent to his baptism of fire in an <strong>abandoned mall</strong> to seek out a space-time fugitive who has been wreaking havoc across time.</p>



<p>It's in this mall that the very diverse ideas behind <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> started coming together. While the <strong>Dead Rising inspiration</strong> was evident throughout the stage, fighting zombie-like enemies using newly unlocked weapons like the <strong>fists and heavy sword weapons</strong>, unleashing Bloody Summer to restore health in a bind, and jumping between real space and <strong>Subspace</strong>, an alternate dimension accessed by using an <strong>old TV set</strong> showing a mysterious individual making almost nonsensical philosophical commentary, to reach power generators scattered all over the place is quite fun, thanks to a somewhat <strong>intricate level design</strong> that makes it easy to look past the relative linearity of the game's world. As is the battle against the space-time criminal, who turns into the massive <strong>Enhanced Phantom</strong> whose diverse moveset puts Romeo's battle skills to the test, forcing him to move between <strong>two different floors</strong> to avoid powerful area-of-effect electric attacks.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251210181909_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The shifting art style is one of the features that defines Romeo is a Dead Man</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As highlighted by the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Back to the Future</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Dead Rising</em> inspirations, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> often feels like a <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">celebration of entertainmen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> media as a whole</strong>. The references are scattered everywhere, even in Romeo's progression systems, which include a sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">minigame that plays like a classic labyrinth arcade game</strong> from the 80s to increase his stats, and a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pong-like minigame</strong> that must be completed to pinpoint the next space-time anomaly, and thus criminal to take down. All of this does make the experience feel a little messy, but it's undeniable that it also gives <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Romeo is A Dead Man</em> a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">certain charm</strong> that is too often missing in modern AAA video games.</p>

<p>With the game's first two chapters being so markedly different from one another, I really can't wait to see what else <em>Romeo is A Dead Man</em> has in store, and if the quality on display in the first hour or so of the game will hold up for the rest of the experience. If it does, I am confident the game has the potential of becoming <strong>one of the best games ever made by Suda51 and Grasshopper Manufacture</strong> when it launches on <strong>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on </strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/"><strong>February 11</strong>.</a></p>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> takes a lot of bold swings in its narrative. Every subsequent act reframes the previous, expanding your perspective of the world and its characters. What awaits at the end is a tragic choice that only the player can make—and there's convincing arguments on both sides.</p><p>From the first hour, it's clear that this game is operating on a different caliber. This world has operated with its own natural laws for years, and you're just trying to catch up and learn. The expeditions and their exploits show the desperation and ingenuity of the people of Lumiere, and their stories are just as compelling as the interpersonal drama that takes centerstage in act 3.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur </em>also does something few games do: The protagonist makes his own choices without any input from the player. In fact, the player doesn't have insights into his thought process either. It makes him feel more alive and like a real character rather than an avatar you're trying to min-max for the most optimal party.</p><p>For all its fantasy elements and weird paintbrush monsters, the game highlights simple, universal emotions and themes anyone can relate to. Grief, escapism, trauma responses, sibling rivalry—it's all there, brought to life in harrowing scenarios with simple but effective metaphors.</p><p>To this day, people debate which ending is the "correct" one, but the truth of the matter is, both are valid. The narrative tells such a human story, and like most tragic human stories, they're complicated. It just depends on your own perspective, and that perspective may change over time.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>We love tablets for the convenience they bring. You can enjoy your favorite shows on a spacious screen, catch up with work on the go, and even keep kids entertained (for a while, at least) with cartoons or games without handing over your phone. There’s no shortage of options on the market, and if you’re after an iPad, we just found a way to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is currently sitting at $300 at Amazon, after a sweet $49 discount.</a> We know, it’s not the biggest price drop out there, but considering Apple products rarely go on sale, grabbing a top-rated iPad for less still feels like a win. The discount applies to blue, silver, and pink models, so there are options to choose from. Maybe go for the classic silver version if you like your gadgets minimal, or choose the stunning pink if you’re after something with a bit more personality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast and Efficient</h2>
<p>This iPad flaunts a gorgeous, 11-inch Liquid Retina display. It’s both spacious and bright, plus it features True Tone technology that can automatically adjust according to the color temperature of the room for a comfortable viewing experience. Walk into a dim room, and it will reduce the brightness to reduce eye strain, and similarly, push it back up when you’re using the tablet outdoors. Right above the screen is a 12MP Center Stage front camera, which makes taking selfies and hopping on video calls a breeze. It keeps your center of focus while delivering impressive picture quality that helps you look your best. The front camera is paired with a 12MP Wide back camera with True Tone flash that is just as great for capturing moments, and even taking 4K videos or scanning documents.</p>
<p>The superfast A16 chip keeps things running smoothly, whether you’re trying to work on a creative project or take notes. iPadOS takes the experience even further by letting you navigate with ease. It even comes packed with essential apps like Safari, Messages, and Keynote to help you get started with work or play right away. This version gets you 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house a ton of photos, all your important programs, and even a few movies, without feeling limited. However, if 128GB feels insufficient, there are 256GB and 512GB versions of the iPad available, too, for $399 and $590, respectively.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to use this iPad for work or creative projects, we highly recommend pairing it with the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the Magic Keyboard Folio. The former lets you draw, sketch, and take notes with ease. The latter, on the other hand, features a two-piece design with a detachable keyboard and a protective back panel. Both of these attach magnetically to the screen, converting your iPad into a mini laptop. As for connectivity, this version supports Wi-Fi 6 to access the internet.</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last an entire workday on a single charge. You won’t have to worry about plugging it in in the middle of something important.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The current 14% discount brings the price down to $300.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, but if you’re after something that can support all your work and entertainment needs on the go, it’s going to be worth it. Snap it up before the deal expires or the stock runs out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NVIDIA has released a brand-new tech showcase for Resident Evil Requiem, offering players a glimpse of Raccoon City in action.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to release next month on February 27, 2026, and the developers have been slowly revealing more information about the game as launch approaches. Recently, the director stated that the upcoming title will be ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-almost-like-having-two-games-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost like having two games</a>‘. Now, Raccoon City’s environment has been teased in a new NVIDIA showcase. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-raccoon-city-looks-and-feels-amazing">Resident Evil Requiem’s Raccoon City Looks and Feels Amazing</h2>



<p>The tease for Resident Evil Requiem’s Raccoon City comes through a new 4K Path Tracing &amp; NVIDIA DLSS 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0mgOPbpagc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> uploaded by NVIDIA. The video showcases short clips of a cityscape that captures a dark, gritty vibe, perfectly aligning with Raccoon City’s aesthetic. In the footage, we see Grace walking through the city, and from the few seconds shown, it looks incredible. Interested readers can check out the video below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Coming to the tech talk, Resident Evil Requiem has been optimised for a wide range of PCs ahead of its release, featuring path-traced effects, DLSS 4, accelerated performance, and enhanced image quality. Thanks to path tracing, the game will be able to render multiple shadows from multiple light sources, along with complex lighting effects such as reflections and refractions through glass.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game will also be available on GeForce Now at launch, allowing players to access the power of a GeForce RTX 5080 with DLSS 4 enabled. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim stated that Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero remakes <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are scheduled for 2027 and 2028, respectively</a>. Additionally, Leon Kennedy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally received his official reveal</a> for Requiem at The Game Awards last month.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/06/woojer-strap-4-review-rumble-pack/</link>
            <guid>1398184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gamers are always looking for the next level. A bigger sword, a more powerful gun, magic that turns your foes into globs of pink mush. But what about levelling up your gaming setup? A headset would always be my first call, and then maybe a pro controller or high end mouse, but what then?</p>
<p>Woojer have their own ideas on that, and they’ve been toting their haptic-infused devices for several years. While the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/woojer-vest-3-review/">Woojer Vest</a> – now on its fourth generation – is the headline grabber, the Woojer Strap is the more accessible option, giving gamers and music lovers an extra layer of immersion by strapping a single device to your body, its haptics shocking, rumbling and thumping in time with the action.</p>



<p>Priced at £124 – with a healthy holiday season discount down to £95 – the Woojer Strap 4 is the latest iteration of the single-unit device. In the box, you’re getting the Woojer Strap 4 central unit, an elasticated strap to wrap around your body, a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, and a double-ended 3.5mm cable to physically connect your audio devices.</p>
<p>As gaming devices go, the Strap 4 is pretty straightforward. The unit itself has some weight to it and feels incredibly robust in your hand, crafted from solid plastic throughout, and available in a series of different colours. To the front, there’s a customisable LED ring with rubberised physical volume and intensity controls within it.</p>

<p>The top edge features the power button and Bluetooth pairing button, while the bottom includes a USB-C charging port and two 3.5mm audio sockets, one for input and the other as a dedicated output. I thought the older model’s copper finish looked great, but the addition of RGB allows the Strap 4 to match your gaming setup, and the extra layer of customisation gives you some individuality too. If you’re not an RGB fan? You can just turn it all off.</p>

<p>You’ll need a mobile device for the Strap 4 setup, and it proves pleasingly simple to connect the device to the Woojer app, where it takes you through pairing to your device, and then the secondary pairing of your headphones to the Strap 4. This all worked first time, which almost never happens, and you then find yourself with the main control page, which gives you an input and output display, as well as power remaining and the current latency setting, which you can alter if you find that the Strap 4’s haptic output doesn’t quite match up with whatever visuals you’re looking at.</p>
<p>Besides that, you can directly control the volume and the intensity, though there’s physical buttons for these as well, and, if needed, you can dive into the haptic sensation mode, which alters the behaviour of the haptics through Broad, Focused and Gaming settings.</p>
<p>The app also gives you decent control over the LED lights. There’s a full spectrum colour wheel to dial in the exact tone you want, adjust the brightness, and choose between a series of different effects to keep things interesting. While you’re playing, it’s not exactly something that adds all that much to the experience, but it’s certainly more futuristic, and if you’re out and about listening to music, you’ll certainly turn a few heads.</p>
<p>The Strap 4 experience is definitely easier to get into than the Woojer Vest. It’s small and portable, doesn’t take up much space, and requires minimal setup. You can just throw it on, and start watching, playing or listening to whatever you want, and I really liked how simple it felt. In turn, it immediately lifts your experience, with the added haptic feedback from your audio immersing you deeper in your content than ever before.</p>

<p>You can wear it in a variety of ways, though Woojer seem to recommend particular setups for particular input types, so for music you’d wear it around your waist, or horizontally while playing VR . Fundamentally, you can go for whatever feels best and most natural to you, and I gravitated most towards wearing it across my body, with the strap over one shoulder and the unit in the centre of my chest. This makes the haptic sensation fire directly into your chest, and explosions and heavy hits thump and rumble straight into you. Just like the rumble motors in a controller, it brings the action to life that bit further, and I find it hard to go back to playing without the extra layer it provides.</p>
<p>I loved using the Strap 4 for regular flat-screen gaming, listening to music and rewatching the most recent Star Trek movies, but VR is where it truly makes a major difference. With your senses cut off from the outside world, the rumble feels more nuanced and powerful, and whether you’re playing Beat Saber and throwing yourself directly into the music, or going for something more action-heavy like the new Deadpool VR, the Strap 4 brings a new level of immersion for a relatively low entry price.</p>
<p>While it can’t compare to the full experience you feel with the Woojer Vest, in terms of value for money, I think the Strap 4 hits the sweet spot between what it brings to your experience and the asking price. If you’ve already got a great headset, a pro controller, and a VR setup, the Strap 4 is practically a no-brainer as the next step in your gaming setup.</p>

<p>The only limitation, and this goes for all Woojer devices, is that this is a physical representation of audio output. That means your experience relies on how the audio is delivered, getting the levels right, and it will change on a game-by-game or song-by-song basis. It means there’s a certain degree of variation and inconsistency that some users might find disappointing, and hopefully Woojer can find a way to tap into the rumble and gamepad haptic signals in future. Once you’ve become accustomed to that abstraction, though, I still don’t think you’ll look back.</p>

<p>Only 4000 copies up for grabs</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love ourselves a bit of Yacht Club Games' stupendously good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> series, and 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a>, a collaboration with the maestros at Nitrome, even managed to swipe <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shovel-knight-dig">a rather excellent 9/10 in our review</a>, where we concluded that the game "positively oozes quality, whether that be the snappy action-platforming or the fresh 16-bit art style and animation."</p>
<p>Now, Super Rare Games has announced that a limited physical edition of this roguelike belter will be made available via its official website <a href="https://superraregames.com/products/srg-146-shovel-knight-dig-switch">right here</a> at <strong>6pm BST / 1pm EST</strong> on <strong>8th January 2026</strong>. Hey, that's this Thursday!</p>
<p>As you'll note if you head over to the site right now, the game isn't yet up for pre-order just yet, so with only 4,000 units to shift (and a limit of two copies per customer in place) we reckon anyone interested should be fairly swift in nabbing a copy once it goes live.</p>
<figure data-uuid="1c971fd9affea"><a title="Shovel Knight Dig physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c971fd9affea/shovel-knight-dig-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Super Rare Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The physical edition of Shovel Knight Dig comes with a full colour manual, exclusive sticker, a set of three trading cards and a "fully assembled Nintendo Switch game with cartridge." Whatever that is (psst, the full game on the cart).</p>
<p>Sounds pretty tasty and, if you happen to have forgotten the ins and outs of this one since it released (hey, three years is a long time ago in this economy), here's some further quick-fire deets to refresh your memory from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>
💎 An all-new presentation featuring a new Shovel Knight story! When Drill Knight and his dastardly digging crew blast apart Shovel Knight’s peaceful campsite and steal his loot, he grabs his trusty Shovel Blade and starts tunneling after them!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>👾 The first Shovel Knight adventure in glorious high color pixel graphics and sound. Fluid animation, scaling, rotation, and parallax create the most convincing Shovel Knight world yet!</p>
<p>🔄️ Every adventure is different! Shovel Knight Dig levels have been meticulously crafted, then stitched together using proprietary generation techniques for infinite replayability.</p>
<p>🪏 Jump, slash, and dig your way in an all-new direction - down! Rely on your trusty Shovel Drop, then dig through huge swaths of dirt with all-new Speed Shovel mechanics.</p>
<p>🦾 Grow in power and wealth as you descend into the depths of the earth. Emerge with untold riches to outfit Shovel Knight further, unlocking permanent items and upgrades to your Shoveling equipment.</p>
<p>⚜️ New Knights, new characters, and new enemies abound, but fear not! Shovel Knight Dig features Shovel Knight’s signature storytelling, humor, and maybe even some familiar faces</p>
<p>🎵 Another pulse-pounding soundtrack in a new style by astonishing virtuoso Jake Kaufman!</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>1398178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Elgato’s Stream Deck has come full circle. Almost eight years after the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/features/24191410/elgato-stream-deck-art-lebedev-optimus-maximus-keyboard-retrospective">picked up the pieces of Art Lebedev’s ambitious Optimus keyboard</a> and went in a different, cheaper direction with the idea, we’re going back to keyboards. Corsair’s Galleon 100 SD, announced at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854159/ces-2026-best-tech-gadgets-smartphones-appliances-robots-tvs-ai-smart-home">CES 2026</a>, is a wired mechanical keyboard that effectively has a full <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23517751/elgato-stream-deck-plus-review">Stream Deck Plus</a> built into it and then some: 12 customizable buttons, a multi-purpose 5-inch 720 x 1280 IPS screen, and two rotary dials.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Elgato’s Stream Deck DNA has appeared in a Corsair product. I reviewed the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23311640/corsair-voyager-a1600-gaming-laptop-review-amd-stream-deck-elgato">Corsair Voyager gaming laptop</a> in 2022, which had uninspiring touch-sensitive buttons that could be configured using Elgato’s software. It was underbaked, but it felt like the start of something that was long overdue, given Corsair acquired Elgato in 2018. The Galleon seems like a remarkable improvement, mostly due to the fact that it’s the full Stream Deck experience, not a distillation. It’s launching January 29th, and you can preorder one now for $349.99.</p><p>Not to dismiss the Galleon’s chops as a gaming keyboard (it has an 8,000Hz polling rate, hot-swappable PCB that comes with MLX Pulse switches, gasket mounting, and FlashTap simultaneous opposing cardinal direction support, to name a few specs), the marquee feature here is most definitely its Stream Deck integration. Elgato general manager Julian Fest tells <em>The Verge</em> that it uses a bigger, higher-resolution screen behind the keys than Stream Decks that are currently available, and its viewing angles are supposedly better, too.</p><p>As you might have predicted — and perhaps feared — the Galleon is technically two different devices controlled by different software. The left side is controlled by Corsair’s web hub browser tool, while the right side requires Elgato’s Stream Deck software. That won’t always be the case for tweaking some settings, Fest tells me. They’re still working on firmware that will let the Stream Deck side control the keyboard for things like LED color profiles and polling rate. It’s also working with publishers to build native Stream Deck integration into more games beyond <em>Star Citizen</em> and other hardcore simulators, although Corsair sees the Galleon as being the best fit for players of those genres over others.</p><p>The Stream Deck has become a tool that’s ubiquitous among streamers, and it’s increasingly a popular tool for everyday users who simply need to mute or turn off their webcams. Its programmable buttons offer a vast array of use cases thanks to a <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/">vibrant marketplace of plug-ins</a>, from launching files or macros to simply popping bubble wrap with former <em>Verge </em>writer Mitchell Clark’s free <a href="https://marketplace.elgato.com/product/bubbledeck-2dfecd5a-2886-449a-8a32-40f52b521d84">Stream Deck plug-in</a>.</p><p>Fest is a power user, unsurprisingly, swiftly using the buttons to queue some Christmas music, swapping to different webcams via OBS, adjusting the brightness of his room’s lighting, then dialing down the volume all while barely moving his fingers. The Stream Deck’s screen is showing the weather and Spotify cover art. It’s a supercharged multifunction station that’s also a keyboard. And, of course, the Stream Deck’s buttons can turn into a numpad, too.</p><p>During the demo, it became clear that this isn’t something that most companies could achieve; the Galleon is a keyboard with an overflowing level of customization, where the software has already been honed for going on eight years. It also may not have happened right now if Corsair didn’t hire Tobias Brinkmann, who founded Mountain keyboards.</p><p>One of that company’s big swings was the Everest Max, a full-size mechanical keyboard that had a detachable numpad complete with four programmable buttons with screens behind them, its own spin on Stream Deck functionality. We liked it in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22996700/mountain-everest-max-keyboard-review-gaming">our 2022 review</a>. Fest tells me that he bought one, took it apart, and had it checked for patent infringement. “At that point, I had no idea who Tobias was. Now, a few years later, he’s heading up our gaming business.”</p><p>“I’m personally grateful that it took Corsair so long, and they couldn’t get it together,” Brinkmann jokes. “It helps that Julian and I both have German backgrounds, and we kind of like each other. So that makes it easier to do it.”</p><p>“I’d still do it if you were an asshole,” Fest adds with a smirk.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/854886/corsair-galleon-100-sd-elgato-stream-deck-specs-price-launch]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new Sony patent has surfaced called ‘Ghost Player’, which is AI tech that can not only guide the players who are stuck, but also play the games for you. </p>



<p>Sony is known to patent new tech years before it is actually released. We have already seen multiple patents for the DualSense controller that discuss <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-new-patent-reveals-a-controller-concept-with-conductive-ink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing conductive ink</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-new-dualsense-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replacing the touchpad with a touchscreen</a>. Now, the new patent focuses on AI technology, which could enable the console to play the game for you. </p>







<h2 id="h-sony-s-ghost-player-ai-patent-talks-about-a-guide-mode-and-a-complete-mode">Sony’s Ghost Player AI Patent Talks About a ‘Guide Mode’ and a ‘Complete Mode’</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> talks about the new ‘Ghost Player’ AI tech patent for Sony, wherein an AI-generated player can either guide a player towards the solution or even complete the game for them. There are two modes, ‘Guide Mode’ and ‘Complete Mode’. The Guide Mode can seemingly create an AI-controlled version of Nathan Drake in a game like Uncharted and show the player how they can get past the level. In ‘Complete Mode’, the AI-controlled character will complete the entire section for the player. </p>



<p>Sony’s Ghost Player AI technology will be trained using existing gameplay footage online and will not require the developer to provide a pre-recorded character to play the game. The AI patent could serve as an upgrade to PlayStation’s existing Game Help feature, which offers hints, tips, images, and even video walkthroughs to guide players through certain sections. </p>



<p>However, players should note that acquiring a patent doesn’t mean the tech will be released; it could be years before we even see it in action, or it may not be released at all. </p>

            <guid>1398166</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, I had the great pleasure of attending the Games Industry Conference (GIC) in Poznań, Wielkopolska, where I sat in on a number of talks about game development and craft. In one of those talks, given by Petr Nohejl, devops programmer for Warhorse Studios, I heard a fascinating anecdote that got me thinking about the silliness of video games, and the lengths testers go to in order to ensure they run smoothly for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nohejl’s talk was about Kingdom Come: Deliverance II and the challenges faced by programmers trying to debug the game, resolve crashes, and deal with gameplay hitches. It was far deeper and more advanced than the bit I’m presenting here, and admittedly pretty over my head in terms of technical specifics, as I’m not a game developer myself. But at one point, he was talking about setting up simple, repeatable scenarios in-game that can be tested automatically, and gave the following example:</p><blockquote>There are some test rotations, so you just spawn the player, you wait, you as I mentioned…and then the player rotates a few times. So it just loads up all the stuff, the streams. And we have these random rotations all around the maps. So the rotation test just like teleports and performs the rotation on thousands and thousands of places on the map. And then we have actually a heat map of the whole rotation test.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, Nohejl is describing what I am told is a quality assurance test where the player is spawned in, they spin around a few times in place, and that’s it. I am told by several individuals I spoke to with QA experience and expertise that this is a very common test and, to most QA professionals, probably pretty boring. But to me, who’d never considered the granular specifics of what went into testing games, it was hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of this discovery, I put out a call on social media and through various PR contacts for QA professionals to share their most ridiculous game testing stories: essentially, what’s the silliest thing they’ve had to do to test something in a game? What came back was a delightful flood of anecdotes ranging across AAA blockbusters to small indies, canvassing a decade or more of game development. I am now thrilled to share these stories with you in hopes that you find the goofy incidentals of QA testing as funny as I do.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shootin’ the Breeze</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“While testing Unreal II for Xbox, if we angled our gun upwards by 45 degrees and shot the assault rifle at the bridge strut as we walked across it, the game would consistently crash. We tested that stupid bridge for weeks.” -Ben Kosmina</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was on Overwatch I had to test to make sure that the materials on the various surfaces were set up properly for hit effects. For example, when shooting wood it would sound like wood was being impacted instead of metal. There are a LOT of materials and surfaces in the various levels, but I had access to the editor tools so I actually made a testing hero to help make things easier. It was basically Widowmaker with a 1s cooldown on her hookshot, Hanzo's wall climb ability, and an expanded magazine size so I could shoot more freely. I also gave myself like 10x movement speed and the ability to toggle the bullet sounds on and off so I could hear the impacts better. Then I proceeded to methodically run around every map shooting every unique material surface to make sure they were making the right noises. When I moved off the team I was chatting with one of my friends and he was saying he still used that hero for testing, which made my day.” -Andrew Buczacki</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[On] Anno 2070, I had to do a series of tests and videos for the USK rating board. Spent several days dropping nukes over and over, zooming in to the little people showing that it wasnt graphic. Had a whole video &amp; Images folder of a mother with a baby buggy no-selling a direct nuke at different angles.” -Ruairí Rodinson, Rho Labyrinths studio head</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Inventing a Guy</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hello! The whole story is a bit more complicated. The NPC in Mental Refreshment [in The Outer Worlds 2] was actually my 1st encounter with a peeing NPC and I thought that, for some reason, the invisible collision is the intended behavior displayed by a urinating NPC. Then, some days later, I saw an NPC performing an unfamiliar animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I curiously walked up to him and, to my great surprise, he was peeing! At that moment the confusion started. ‘Why does the game let me get so close to him?’ ‘I couldn't even dream of coming this close to the other peeing NPC!’ And so, the investigation has begun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After bothering a few other innocent pissing NPCs it turned out that my fundamental assumption that NPCs are supposed to be shielded while relieving themselves was wrong! I dutifully reported the excessive collision on the mentally refreshed subject and now the User can peacefully watch him do his business from up close.” -Aleksander Gozdzicki, FQA Tester, QLOC, The Outer Worlds 2</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I was a programmer rather than QA, but I remember having to get creative when I was testing some of my code on Kinect. I had some code that was meant to detect someone making air guitar motions, and I had to shove my hoodie up my T-shirt in order to check that it would work with pregnant people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When testing the 'new user' Kinect login sequence we had to wear carnival masks to stop it from recognizing us.” -Tim Aidley</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“On Saints Row we had a debug npc named Skinballs (lol) that was literally just four spheres wrapped in different shades of skin texture so we could test lighting for different skin tones during development…teams need to plan for that kind of testing with intentionality, and not enough do.” -Elizabeth Zelle</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/bafkreicz6wfne6ja5frh5fzkmmgun6ouuurxuqvtxayy2byye2wcwfdabm-1766179538710.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Skinballs.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“My favorite example of this was ‘The Carwash’ on Mortal Kombat (X? 11?) where a T-posed character would slowly move through a series of particle emitters, each one causing a specific type of damage - cuts, stabs, burns, gashes, ice, etc. so we could test damage models on characters.” -Daanish Syed, former Netherrealm Artist</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We used placeholder characters earlier in Sunderfolk’s development whilst character art was still pending. One in particular was a free character model from Adobe’s Mixamo site called ‘Brute’ which was essentially a large oily barbarian. He was regularly used to fill in the board and for cinematics to see how animations look and function. Affectionately named Oily Man, we still use him in-engine for hero spawn indicators in the encounter designer. Oily Man lives on!” -Ali Tirmizi, Sunderfolk QA Lead at Secret Door</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">WoW!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Andrew Buczacki graciously supplied me with a number of anecdotes from his time on World of Warcraft, which I’ve included all as one chunk for the WoW fans in the room:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When testing the final boss of the Icecrown raid in Wrath of the Lich King, we had a bug where Frostmourne (the Lich King's sword) didn't appear in cinematic on a specific hardware configuration. They mobilized the entire QA floor for WoW to test every permutation of graphics setting, resolution, etc. to see if it was happening anywhere else. By the end of the testing day we had all watched the cinematic (and seen most of the raid fight), to the point where many of us had memorized the monologues and the cinematic. You'd randomly hear "Bolvar!" for months after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also on that fight, I was assigned a hotfix where one of the AoEs the boss did was supposed to expand 15% faster. There were no good precise measuring tools so my friend and I set up a ridiculous testing contraption involving engineering smoke flares, a hunter pet, and liberal use of in-game cheats. At the end we were able to verify that it was at least expanding faster, although I argue we got a degree of precision that probably wasn't necessary by the end.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Old time WoW fans may remember that over the course of a few patches the shoulderpads on some race/gender combos (male Orcs most notably) shrunk. This was eventually caught and fixed, but to make sure it didn't happen again one of the tests my team ran was to look at a fixed gallery of character models wearing various equipment on the current version and the newest build. We had an automated script that would log in and take pictures from fixed angles and equip the same things so we could compare screenshots to make sure that everything stayed the same size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once I had to test and verify that the ‘Win a loot roll with a 100’ achievement was working. To do this I went to Onyxia's Lair (a popular sandbox for QA), and after not winning the lottery and winning loot with a 100 on Onyxia I spawned in about 100 raid bosses at once with god mode on. Then I used super powerful AoE cheat spells to kill them all and began the laborious process of looting and rolling on all of them. The achievement totally worked, by the way.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">CAN you pet the dog?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“So here's something that I'm pretty sure most people don't ever think about: Testing "Can you Pet the dog?" in games. Like, it's a feature a lot of people look for and adore in video games, but I don't think your every day average person realizes that, as cute as it is, it took people HOURS upon HOURS to get it right haha. So in Demonschool for instance, when you pet the dog, you'll get unique dialogue per interaction. The dog can also be found on different maps and depending on the date and how many times you've pet him, he might move to different locations. If you sit there and let Faye pet the dog, the camera will (very) slowly zoom in to give the player a better view of it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“At one point in development, we came to find out of that one of the random softlocks we were encountering was actually tied to the adorable, lovable action of petting the dog. This meant that we had to spend HOURS testing every possible variable of petting the dog. Every location it showed up in, every dialogue string attached to it, every date it was available to pet. We'd skip petting it certain days  and in certain locations to try to mix up where it appeared in the game on different dates to see if THAT was causing the issue. We had to make sure that the slow camera zoom was working on each and every map that the dog can appear on, and every VERSION of those maps (day, evening, and night).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So what ultimately should be a fun, cute little easter egg that pretty much every random player enjoys seeing in a game, ended up becoming hours and hours of work behind the scenes to make sure it worked just right and wouldn't softlock the game for everyone haha. And after tons of hours and hundreds of pets, we can now all happily pet the dog without issue!” -AJ McGucken, lead QA at Ysbryd Games</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make Some Noise</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“One time when I was doing audio for god of war, we had put a sound of a frog croaking on the frog asset. Well, one of the level designers took that frog and COVERED an island in them. So I had to make a JIRA ticket to kill frog island.” -Shayna Moon, senior technical producer</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Off the top of my head, I found a bug working on New Super Mario for Wii that was at the start screen. The game shows the title and plays a little song. At the end of the song, it transitions to "demo" footage of Mario &amp;co jumping around. If you press start, you are taken to the starting menus (new game, load game, options etc) IN THEORY, but if you happen to press start at the EXACT moment between the two states of the start screen, the game instead hard locks and must be force-restarted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, every day we got a new build, I had to regress this bug by sitting at the start screen and trying to press start at exactly the right moment. If it didn't lock, I had to back out and try again. It was extremely tedious and difficult to get right, proving a negative. Another tester was a little better at the timing than me so we would do this together every morning, just pushing start, for hours, like the world's worst rhythm game.” -Anonymous</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>In addition to all the anecdotes I received for this piece, I also conducted an interview with Camden Stoddard, audio director at Double Fine working on Keeper. Stoddard chatted with me about the complex process he went through to get Twig, the bird, to sound exactly right, which included a lot of strange testing practices.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The emotional bond between Twig and the Lighthouse in Keeper was critical to the game, so Stoddard spent a lot of time testing different things to get the communication between the two just right. He tried actual bird sounds and recordings and libraries. He tried using a foghorn with the Lighthouse, "which no matter what you do, a foghorn doesn't get that emotional," he said. So he muted the Lighthouse, which worked out better, but there was still the matter of the bird, Twig. I'll let Stoddard take it from here:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wasn't reaching it with the recordings of birds. So I just started studying how a bird talks, and it turns out their larynx is unique in nature. They have two. They have an avian larynx where they have a lower one called a syrinx. And basically, that means that their pitch control and their pattern control is ridiculous. They can just do things that most animals cannot with their voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I started thinking about that. I'm like, 'Well, okay, this bird is way beyond the emotional tone of an actual bird. So we need a human performance here. So how do I make a human sound like a bird?' So I just started fooling around with my own voice, and I wound up finding this software that was meant for electronic music. It was from an electronic group in Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And I had used it before, but what was interesting about it is a lot of things you can adjust, pitch and things like that, but this, you could adjust the harmonics trail. That was what was interesting. And as soon as I put my voice through it and I started messing around with it, I became a bird. My voice just started sounding like a bird, which made a lot of sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So I started experimenting with, I would do the performance as the bird. I started studying how birds communicate, and then I started thinking about, "Okay. Well, if I can have the sound of the bird, but I can have the emotional punctuation and pattern that we want emotionally, then I think we got it nailed." So over about two years, I finally got how to do Twig. And the hard part on me was, the best way to do Twig was to inhale while I was doing the sound and not exhale, because when you inhale, your larynx becomes much more raw and kind of nonhuman-sounding. So if I inhale, you're like... You get this crazy range that you're not used to. And once I manipulated that, that's where Twig came from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So then all of a sudden, I became like an actor, and I had to figure out these heavy, heavy scenes, which I hadn't counted on, because it's a very emotional game. There's some heights of anger and sadness and surprise and true existentialism in the end. It's wild. So I not only had to go to the limits of my sound design know-how, I had to figure out how to make this bird very emotional and really care about this lighthouse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Below is a recording shared with us by Stoddard showing the three-step transformation of his voice from his own bird sounds to the final sounds used in the game. It uses a Granelli SM57 dynamic microphone going through an Avalon 737sp preamp, and various software to edit it, including a combo of Eventide 910 and 949 harmonizers (software) and Manipulator by Polyverse (software). It was all recorded in Pro Tools.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Climb Every Mountain, Drop Every Weapon</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">"When working on the Mr. X Nightmare DLC for Streets of Rage 4, the team noticed that sometimes, when a player dropped their weapon, it would fall through the floor. We had to drop all the weapons to identify the issue, which turned out to be specific to a single weapon... the swordfish! Perhaps it's a new type of flying fish?" -Laura Peitavi, lead senior QA, Streets of Rage 4 DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound, the player character (Kenji) can climb up walls. However, when attempting to grab a wall with a small surface, he would often assume an unnatural position where it appears that he is supporting his entire body weight with a single arm. The level designers at The Game Kitchen could set an "is climbable" property for each wall in the Unity game engine, but there was no way to set this property to false automatically for every short wall found in the game. Therefore, Dotemu's entire QA team had to attempt to grab every single wall in the game in order to find which ones could lead to animation issues so that The Game Kitchen could alter the properties of the problematic walls." -James Petit, QA analyst - Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Castle Made of WHAT</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">“Back in 2022, well before we announced Wildgate, ‘Banana Castle’ was the nickname we gave to this example project that we sent to external vendors so they could help us identify performance bottlenecks in our physics simulation, without revealing what we were actually working on. Using stock Unreal assets, we glued these models together to test our in-game physics.” - Grant Mark, Wildgate technical director at Moonshot</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had a test level [in The Outer Worlds 2] that was a tower where each room was a different physical material, which meant that some of the rooms had walls/ceilings/floors made entirely of hair or skin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Different ‘physical materials’ will have different sound/visual effects depending on the material. For example, if you fire a bullet at a concrete floor, the decal (a bullet hole), the impact VFX (sparks flying or whatever) and the sound effects will be different than if you had fired at the ground on a sandy beach. Footsteps also make different sounds when walking around on these different materials. In addition to things like concrete and sand, we also have physical materials for hair and skin (so that they can have the appropriate response to being shot at or whatever). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If I wanted to quickly verify that these effects were working correctly it was useful to be able to load into this test level, teleport to the room with the physical material I was looking for, and then I could test for all of these material-specific features by shooting the walls and walking around on the floors and such.” -Josh Ledford, QA analyst, Obsidian for The Outer Worlds 2</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

"Hidden in the Ghost Market beneath Kaifeng, the Nine Mortal Ways Camp Serves as a gathering place for sect members with diverse personalities, full of intrigging encounters, secret treasures, and bustling fun — but beware of the scams!" the team teases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Version 1.2 also ushers in "large-scale, coordinated multiplayer combat" with the arrival of the Guild Battle Pre-Season. You'll be able to test guild strategies across six "intense" matches, which will be allocated to distinct Guild Regions based on country/region to "ensure broader accessibility for guild members worldwide." Crucially, this means each Guild Region will launch matches "simultaneously according to its local time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This pre-season is crucial for us to gather player feedback and refine the core Guild Battle mechanics," the development team explained. "We encourage all guilds to rally their members, hone their tactics, and prepare for the even more expansive guild content planned in upcoming updates."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the full roadmap of what else to expect:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/unnamed-1767697884317.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IMAGE CREDIT: EVERSTONE STUDIOS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-winds-meet-review"><u>Where Winds Meet review</u></a> returned a 6/10.

            <guid>1398157</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> came out in 2020, fans have debated Act 1, which sees V befriend Jackie Welles and attempt to make it big in Night City before the infamous heist mission goes horribly wrong. Some feel the game would have been better had Act 1 been extended and given players more time with the much-loved — but short-lived — companion character. But what does the creative director of Cyberpunk 2 think?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>, CD Projekt's Igor Sarzynski said extending Act 1 before the heist wouldn’t have made Cyberpunk 2077 a better game, and he used Star Wars to back up his point: “it's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then: “the motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague — 'get to the top' — which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in meandering, unfocused experience.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Act 2 picks up after the shocking events of Act 1 and Jackie’s untimely death, with V desperate to find a cure for the Relic in their head. Part of the story involves V grieving for Jackie and helping other characters deal with his death in their own ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some Cyberpunk 2077 players, determined to spend as much time as possible with Jackie before the inevitable happens, focus on Watson, the Act 1 playable area, and little else — something Sarzynski acknowledged in his posts. “It's an open world game, some manage to squeeze 20 hours out of Watson,” he said. “Pick your own pace.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Sarzynski acknowledged the ongoing debate around how much time players get to spend with Jackie. “Is it enough time to bond with Jackie?” he asked. “For some it is, for some it isn't. All things considered I think we struck a good balance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, “No, half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this. But more on 'cut content' notion in some other post.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sarzynski has moved on to Cyberpunk 2, and there’s no indication that anything he’s said here on Jackie has a bearing on what to expect from the hotly-anticipated sequel. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has been chatty about it, however. In May last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-has-night-city-and-another-city-that-feels-like-chicago-gone-wrong-mike-pondsmith-teases"><u>Pondsmith teased some previously unknown details</u></a> when he was asked about the scope of his involvement with Cyberpunk 2 (then known as Project Orion) at the Digital Dragons 2025 conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pondsmith admitted he wasn’t as involved this time around, but said he does review scripts and had been to CD Projekt to check out the ongoing work. “Last week I was wandering around talking to different departments, and seeing what they had, ‘Oh look, this is the new cyberware, what do you think?’ ‘Oh yeah, that’s pretty good, that works here,’” he said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, the morsel on the sequel: that it features a brand new city in addition to the Night City we know from Cyberpunk 2077. Pondsmith described this new city as “like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit — I’m not telling you any more than that but there’s another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn’t feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth pointing out that Pondsmith’s comments do not necessarily suggest the Cyberpunk sequel will feature a future Chicago, rather a city that has the feel of a dystopian version of the city. It may well be a take on future Chicago, but that isn’t confirmed based on these comments. There is also some debate about whether Cyberpunk 2 will expand upon the Night City that’s in Cyberpunk 2077 or feature a new version, and the extent to which it is playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like we'll have to wait some time to find out. CD Projekt is of course focusing on The Witcher 4, and CD Projekt co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has suggested Cyberpunk 2 won’t be out until at least 2030.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>For a long time, it has been speculated that the <strong>half-year montage replaced cut content</strong>, but that is not the case, as <strong>Act 1</strong> was reportedly designed the way it was from the beginning to avoid a <strong>meandering, unfocused experience</strong> that would have made most players bounce off the game.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Cyberpunk 2077's</em></strong> sequel creative director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Igor Sarzynski</strong> commented on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>, detailing why extending it wouldn't have made for a better experience, making an interesting comparison with the first movie in the original <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Star Wars</em></strong> trilogy: "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">No, it wouldn't. It's like saying we should spend more time on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Tatooine</strong> with farmer <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Luke</strong> before he got involved with all this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jedi stuff</strong>,"</em> Sarzynski said.</p>



<p>Besides, extending the story of <strong>Act 1</strong> wouldn't have necessarily extended playtime for most players, as with <strong>open-world games</strong>, players are free to choose their own pace. More interestingly, however, the <strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></strong> creative director highlighted how the motivation in this portion of the game wouldn't have made for an engaging experience.</p>



<p><strong><em>"The motivation / goal in this section of the game is pretty vague - 'get to the top' - which, prolonged and without stakes or pressure would result in a meandering, unfocused experience,"</em></strong> Sarzynski explained.</p>



<p>In another message, the sequel creative director provided further clarification on this motivation being too vague:<em> <strong>"Do jobs, make money, make reputation" - ok but what for? what are you trying to achieve? there would have to be a more specific goal for this section. 'Do stuff' without a clear hurdle to clear would make a lot of players bounce off the game."</strong></em></p>



<p>This isn't just a vague prediction, according to <strong>Sarzynski</strong>, as building reputation <strong><em>"is not a specific, measurable goal. and it's not about my opinion, we have telemetry, UX lab, survey data."</em></strong> Feeling that a good balance was also struck in regards to the time to bond with <strong>Jackie</strong>, Sarzynski ultimately confirmed that the <strong><em>"half-year montage is not cut content. We always planned it like this</em>."</strong></p>



<p>Given <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">that&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Act 1</strong>&nbsp;remains one of the most hotly debated&nbsp;<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">topics in Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em>, the community's opinion on the ma</span>tter appears to be generally at odds with the way this story segment has been designed. Some like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcleansix.bsky.social/post/3mbpbvdf27k2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew C. McLean</a></strong> feel that the in-game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation rating</strong> would have made the "reach the top" goal more tangible. </p>



<p>While setting a goal like reaching a certain level is not the kind of storytelling <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CD Projekt Red</strong> wants to do, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sarzynski</strong> admits that something of the sort would have been doable, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em>"it would require a significant rewrite and introducing a storyline that contextualizes and structures this getting to the top."</em></strong> </p>



<p>Likewise, others would have loved to experience <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">V</strong> reaching the top, or spending more time with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Jackie</strong>, although in some ways, not having had that much time with this likeable character made the events of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">heist</strong> even more impactful.</p>



<p>Considering how it's possible to spend so much time in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Night City</strong> completing meaningful content that further fleshes out the franchise's universe, I understand why the developer made some sacrifices to keep the narrative pace tighter. However, it's undeniable that, for a first playthrough, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">half-year montage can feel disappointing</strong>. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see if the community's opinion on this matter will influence the development of the <strong>second entry in the series</strong>, which promises to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">an even bigger game.</a></strong></p>

Others, it's for the thrill of competition. Whatever the reason is, multiplayer games are often the throughline of most people's year with games. Here are our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Multiplayer Award for exceptional multiplayer gameplay and design.</p><ul><li>Battlefield 6</li><li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li><li>Mario Kart World</li><li>Peak</li><li>Split Fiction</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><h2>Third Place - Split Fiction</h2><p>Developer: Hazelight Studios | Release Date: March 6th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Josef Fares may forever be the man who publicly hated on the Oscars once, but let's not forget that he and his studio champion unique multiplayer experiences. <em>Split Fiction</em> is the latest of his games, and it's filled to the brim with gameplay that puts cooperation centerstage.</p><p>It starts off easy, with each player getting access to a couple unique mechanics. These mechanics compliment each other, often requiring a one-two punch to solve a puzzle or beat an enemy. It's simple, but the game layers on challenges to mix things up. These mechanics change every level and evolve over the course of each level, keeping things fresh.</p><p>Each stage swaps back and forth between fantasy and sci-fi for narrative reasons, and homages to other franchises are peppered throughout. It all culminates with a fantastic interdimensional setpiece that puts the marketing behind<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em> to shame.</p><p>That doesn't even scratch the surface of some of the more unique gameplay moments in <em>Split Fiction</em>. Everyone loves the motorcycle chase scene with the CAPTCHA mini game, but no one talks about when the game turns into pinball or <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> for a minute.</p><p>Few games go in this hard on a crafted two-player co-op experience, and <em>Split Fiction</em> is an easy recommendation for two people to enjoy each other's company over a game.</p><h2>Second Place - Battlefield 6</h2><p>Developer: Battlefield Studios | October 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>In late 2021, <em>Battlefield </em>took a bit of a nosedive with the release of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was widely considered one of, if not the worst entries in the series. Following that incident, Respawn developer Vince Zampella (whose legacy cannot be overstated enough) was called in to oversee the <em>Battlefield </em>series. Zampella unfortunately passed late last year, but there is no doubt in my mind he played a pivotal role in turning this series around with <em>Battlefield 6</em>.</p><p>With <em>Battlefield 6</em>, we’re met with a robust multiplayer experience comprising an absolute TON of guns and customizations, giving us some of the weightiest and most visceral combat in the series. Playing on a giant map with dozens of other players, or getting together with your own squad of friends to accomplish objectives, feels like the good ol’ days that made <em>Battlefield </em>such a coveted franchise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Peak</h2><p>Developer: Aggro Crab, Landfall | Release Date: June 16th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>The term "friendslop" was coined recently to describe a game like <em>Peak</em>, but it undermines just how great of an experience <em>Peak</em> is. It's silly, challenging, and rewarding. Most games are generally better with friends, but <em>Peak </em>transforms into something that feels like lightning in a bottle.</p><p>Climbing the newly generated mountain every day requires a lot of effort, teamwork, and communication, which all can breed frustration and stress in multiplayer environments. But with its cartoony presentation and lighthearted atmosphere, the vibes stay relaxed.<br>Ingenious items keep the gameplay exciting, where every situation can be answered with the perfect item. The limiting inventory adds just enough tension to keep things engaging, especially with how it forces you to communicate—and opens the door for some mischievous item misuse.</p><p>Even failure is funny in <em>Peak</em>. Nothing beats hearing your friend fall as the spatial audio does its magic. Coming back as a ghost is great too, giving everyone the ability to participate and make color commentary, regardless of skill level.</p><p>For what feels like a silly joke, for what amounts to a "friendslop" game, <em>Peak</em> exemplifies what a perfect casual game night should be. This isn't for the sweaty leaderboard chasers; this is for the silly group of friends who love a good laugh.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
