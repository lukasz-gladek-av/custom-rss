            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, a full ground-up remake of the original 2006 JRPG, has reached a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1951080103439413554" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-persona-3-reload-trailer" rel="nofollow">launching last February</a>. The new sales figure means the game has picked up an additional million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sells-over-1-million-copies-fastest-in-atlus-history" rel="nofollow">since its launch week</a>, during which it cemented itself as Atlus' fastest-selling game (until being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">overtaken by&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s new sales milestone also comes just a handful of hours after the game was announced to be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct presentation</a>. It'll land on Nintendo's newest console on October 23rd.</p>

<p>The game focuses on an unnamed teenage protagonist who must battle through the mysterious tower of Tartarus at night while building relationships with his school friends and other acquaintances during the day.</p>

<p><i>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</i>lacks some of the features introduced by 2009's&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, including the playable female protagonist and associated social links. It also technically lacks much of the "Answer" storyline introduced in expanded re-release&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 FES</em>, although a version of that story was later sold as an additional DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Reload</em>.</p>




<p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s success has spurred Atlus on to create another&nbsp;remake in the form of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this year's Xbox summer showcase</a>. We don't yet know when that one's arriving, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/persona-3-reload/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9nkk6z0k3rh2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's coming to Switch 2 in October.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><em>When this goes live, Patrick will, god willing, be in a pub in London. </em></p><p><em>Vacations are odd. Are you going somewhere to relax, or are you going somewhere for experiences? Arguably, the path is in-between, because if you were to live in such a place, would you be chasing every tourist trip? </em></p><p><em>Maybe a trip is, instead, to hang with family or friends. The goal isn't to do much of anything at all except to soak up time with loved ones and be in proximity. Where you do that means less than the being off it all.</em></p><p><em>Either way, it's important to get out the house. </em></p><p><em>You don't need to travel halfway across the world to do something new and different. This week, though, Rob and Patrick unpack the travel they've done over the years, what it means to travel when it's really in service of work, and how long you need to be in a place to "be" there.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s strange. Over my life, I’ve been fortunate enough to travel across the world a few times, landing up in Iceland, Japan, and Germany. Sometimes a few days, sometimes a week.</p><p>The one thing those trips have in common, though, was <em>work</em>. Iceland was to attend an <em>EVE Online</em> convention. Japan was, of course, Tokyo Game Show. Germany was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the show that would become Gamescom</u></a>. It’s hard to complain about a “free” international trip, but in every case, I was doing interviews, writing blog posts, and doing lots of <em>work</em>. Plus, it was a little bit like how I can say I’ve been to Seattle a dozen times. But have you really been to Seattle if you’re just going to PAX to walk around a convention center, before you hang out at a bar?</p><p>It wasn’t until I went to PAX with my family a few years back where we stayed long enough to actually do touristy stuff in Seattle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQhOmebDqo&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I finally went on the damn Space Needle.</u></a> That’s ridiculous.</p><p>Are you really visiting a place if you’re just doing the same things you’d do somewhere else? But when I went to those other places for work, I didn’t have the money to stay an extra week!</p><p>It’s only in recent years that my wife and I have mulled a “real” vacation. Even then, we do not have the kind of family support that would let us drop off the kids for a week and jet off. I’m grateful for having my mom around in a pinch, but my mom couldn’t handle a week on her own.</p><p>So in reality, the cost of the vacation inflates and what you can <em>do</em> on it changes radically. We considered doing something closer, more explicitly centered around the kids. But fuck it, man.</p><p>A few years back, as we considered breaking the seal on Disney, my wife wondered aloud if the kids would be old enough in a few years for something more ambitious. She had never left the confines of North America, venturing only to Canada and Mexico over the years, and had always dreamed of visiting Paris. Worried it wouldn't be the “best” destination for young children, I told her we should go to Paris anyway. We’d figure out a way to make it really fun with the kids.</p><p>(Everything we’ve read since makes it sounds like it’ll actually be delightful for the kids. We’re even sneaking two nights and one day at Disneyland Paris, to bring things entirely full circle.)</p><p>Still, in some ways, I’m in the same place I was last time. I’m about to attend a cool place with a caveat. Now, it’s <em>kids</em> instead of <em>work</em>. I’ll happily take one over the other, obviously, but we spent decades clawing our way into a place where we could consider travelling and now, once again, it’s probably another decade until we could reasonably consider doing it only as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is very few of us will ever have the means to pull off the idealized vacation. I still expect we’re going to have a wonderful time. And if I’m being honest, I’m delighted, proud, and jealous my kids are having a trip like this at their age. That wasn’t in the cards for my family at that age, and it’s a testament to all the support my family gave <em>me</em> that I’m now in this position.</p><p>Yet…I wish I could sneak off to the catacombs with my wife without jumping through hoops lol</p><p>Anyway. What have your vacations been like over the decades? What’s <em>your</em> Paris?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@chriskaridis?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Chris Karidis</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>We haven’t really had vacations until a couple years ago when we went on our big Disney World vacation. Which was, warts-and-all, a really special trip. The Animal Kingdom Lodge legitimately changed how we understood lighting, and how much it shapes a place. It’s an expensive hotel but it’s an experience MK and I refer back to <em>constantly </em>when we think about how to design and light an interior space.</p><p>I think the best (only?) real vacation prior to that was a tiny house on Lake Michigan. It was probably the most MK and I have ever had to ourselves to just hang out in our entire relationship. My entire memory of the days in that cabin is just the two of us sitting by a roaring bonfire watching the sun slide across the sky and the stars come out. It was a little early in the season so the lake was quite cold but it also made that fire feel like heaven on earth. It’s another thing we refer back to a lot and now I think of it, the place we’re buying has elements of both those vacations! It’s a cozy, sleek wood home with lots of private outdoor space. Hopefully it facilitates the making of those kinds of happy memories on a more regular basis.</p><p>As for what’s my Paris… I think it’s probably Paris or… Tokyo. I have never been to Japan but I’ve never met anyone who didn’t love their time there. It intimidates the hell out of me: I don’t speak or read any of the language and long flights are a struggle. But the idea of spending a few weeks or a month in Japan is captivating.</p><p>That’s the other thing: I don’t tend to do well with short trips. I like to live in a place more than I like to visit it. My ideal vacation is not a weekend or even a couple weeks, it’s spending a season somewhere. Long enough to find my own rhythms and relationship with it, to not feel like I need to go see a museum or a heritage site but can instead spend the day watching sports before going out for dinner at a restaurant or meeting up with friends in the area.</p>

It's rumored that the game will launch on November 14, which would be about a month after Battlefield 6 launches.</p><p>The Call of Duty series has been released on an annual basis since 2005, but the Battlefield franchise has no set schedule for releases. Battlefield 2042 was preceded by 2018's Battlefield 5, with a three-year gap between them. Battlefield 1, meanwhile, was released two years prior in 2016.</p><p>Developers on Battlefield 6 told <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1951000916188106868" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> that they believes Battlefield 6 is "unique" as it competes against Call of Duty. "There's something about it you can't get in any other game. Our focus is on delivering the best Battlefield game we can. A game our old-school, hardcore fans will love."</p><p>You don't have to wait until October to play Battlefield 6, as there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">free open beta that kicks off very soon.</a></p>

<p>Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." That is seemingly a reference to the DLC skin for Call of Duty that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">lets you play as Minaj.</a> Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, producer Alexia Christofi said much the same thing, explaining that Battlefield Studios is hoping to make Battlefield 6's skins "feel grounded."</p><p>"We want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like, 'I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin,'" Christofi said. "But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking."</p><p>Producer David Sirland added that keeping player skins in the "grounded" realm also has gameplay benefits. Each of the four classes--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-class-system-is-a-welcome-return-to-basics/1100-6533614/" data-ref-id="1100-6533614">and yes, the traditional classes are back</a>--are identified with designations on the shoulder, similar to how it worked in past games.</p><p>"For example, there is a ghillie material on the Recon skins, and they're not used on the other [classes] to really emphasize the differences," he said. "There are some rules there, but it's looser rules than, 'It's always going to look like this.' But it needs to feel like it fits the universe, because part of why I think we're getting good feedback here is because it feels like 3 and 4, in a sense, where it fits. I think that's really important."</p><p>Because Call of Duty and Fortnite are such massive games with huge audiences, it makes sense that companies see those games as a marketing and promotional vehicle for whatever they are selling. That's why we've seen skins in those games promoting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">movies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">TV shows</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-leak-reveals-cheech-chong-devin-booker-operators-are-coming-and-snoop-dogg-is-returning/1100-6521642/" data-ref-id="1100-6521642">more</a>. The financial arrangements around these crossovers are unknown, but it would stand to reason that compensation, in some form or another, is part of the deal.</p><p>The Battlefield series has welcomed skins over the years, too, but not on the level of Call of Duty and Fortnite when it comes to crossovers or wacky stuff like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloth. </a> It appears that tradition is holding for Battlefield 6, and many fans are responding positively thus far.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has not yet fully unveiled its plans for Battlefield 6 microtransactions and store bundles, but we do know the game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">have a Battle Pass and some kind of "BF Pro" token.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open beta</a> kicks off very soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-sales-hit-6m-worldwide-as-nintendo-revenue-soars.1259541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and shockingly enough, the company's revenue is up when compared to the previous year, while Switch 2 sales are looking pretty solid overall.</p>

<p>As revealed in its accompanying financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo's sales jumped by 132% between April and June when compared to the same period a year prior. This is, of course, largely down to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">the release</a> of the Switch 2 in early June.</p>

<p>Net profits rose by around 18.6% when compared to last year, but as Nintendo points out, the Switch 2 has a smaller profit margin than the original Switch, which accounts for what might be a smaller number than you expected to see, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">console's success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=ARCic_pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=YTIKsAO_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like Bowser and his son bought themselves a Switch 2. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say the Switch 2 has been a success, too. According to Nintendo, the console managed to sell over six million units within its first seven weeks, and since we're nowhere near the holiday season yet, those numbers are only likely to increase by the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2 where Nintendo is concerned, managed to sell 5.62 million units in the weeks leading up to June 30th as well. Technically, though, that figure refers to "sell-in" rather than "sell-through", which includes both copies Nintendo sent to business partners and those bought by customers either directly through the Nintendo site or as downloadable software.</p>

<p>As Nintendo points out, it's also got more than a few games in the pipeline for the Switch 2. This month will see the release of wheelchair basketball sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Drag x Drive</em></a>, and hotly-anticipated games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</i>(both also coming to the original Switch) will arrive later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=8k2241Sr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=rNRuUP-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is just one of Nintendo's holiday titles (we assume).</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are looking up for Nintendo right now, although whether the Switch 2 can replicate the original console's long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo's financial statement for the first quarter follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct</a>, during which we learned about new releases like Square Enix's HD-2D action RPG&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales&nbsp;</em>and Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-dear-me-i-was-switch-2-a-bold-heartfelt-wordless-visual-novel.1259517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157713/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>A common complaint levied against visual novels is that they’re some of the most text-heavy games one can find on the market. Who wants to spend hours upon hours reading dialogue during precious gaming time? Answer: me, and plenty of other people, but it’s a valid perspective to consider. Visual <em>novels</em> are generally wordy beasts with extended runtimes, which can make their appeal rather limited. That makes the occasional outlier that bucks genre conventions all the more intriguing.</p>
<p>Such is the case with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was…</a>, a fresh <em>visual</em> novel from the minds at Arc System Works that eschews written or spoken dialogue in favour of relying on visuals and music to tell its narrative. It’s a bold stylistic move, but the heartfelt tale that this game weaves stands as a testament to how much a story can say without saying anything at all.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157715/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the course of its roughly hour-long runtime, Dear me, I was… chronicles the life of an unnamed woman from her early childhood years to adulthood and beyond. The narrative jumps between pivotal points in the protagonist’s life, capturing snapshot moments of joy and sorrow as she develops connections with the world and people around her. Most importantly, it depicts her lifelong journey as an artist and the way in which her relationship with this creative medium evolves as the years go by.</p>
<p>It’s a simple, grounded story devoid of the major twists or melodrama one might expect from the genre, but that’s entirely by design. The woman’s life is one that the average player can likely relate to on some level, and that makes her struggles, discoveries, and experiences all the more resonant. I was genuinely caught off guard by how hard some of the emotional moments hit me, in spite of the game’s abbreviated length. The story tackles themes of loss and self-doubt with an impressive degree of realism and restraint, which makes its heavier beats feel earned rather than coming off as cheap tearjerker attempts.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157716/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the core story of Dear me, I was… is elevated considerably by its unique presentation. With art director Taisuke Kanasaki at the helm, the game’s visual identity evokes shades of Cing classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> series. This title features an elegant, painterly art style with heavy use of watercolours. Tonal shifts in the story are accompanied by movement between vibrant full colour, cooler blue-and-grey, and black-and-white palettes — a clever way of visually expressing the protagonist’s emotional state.</p>
<p>Characters also display an impressive degree of fluid movements and nuanced expressions thanks to the use of rotoscoping of the live-action cast for animation. These detailed visuals, combined with the melancholy tones of the piano-oriented soundtrack, add another layer of richness and depth to the story while simultaneously keeping everything expressive enough to clearly convey the narrative without words.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Dear me, I was… features a touch of interactivity through the incorporation of basic point-and-click sections. Throughout each chapter, the occasional sequence sees you performing basic actions like eating breakfast or drawing a sketch. You have your choice of button controls, touch controls, or even the Switch 2’s built-in Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for these portions, which is neat.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157714/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, these scenes usually amount to little more than clicking somewhere on the screen once or twice without much in the way of game essence. Rather, the occasional interactive element serves as a means to deepen the player’s connection with the protagonist’s story by having them perform small actions to progress it. I’m fine with that limited degree of player input, though I would have appreciated some more creativity for these interactive sequences in the vein of the puzzles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a> — a game with a similar tone and format.</p>
<p>All in all, Dear me, I was… is quite the enjoyable audio-visual experience — which, unfortunately, makes its incredibly short duration a bit of a bummer. While it’s priced accordingly and manages to tell a touching little tale in a very limited timespan, it’s tough for me not to feel like I breezed through the whole thing in the blink of an eye. It’s concise almost to a fault, and there are portions of the plot where slowing things down a bit and letting certain story beats breathe could have resulted in an even more compelling narrative.</p>

<p>I suppose that’s part of the game’s point, though — life goes by quickly. Perhaps the fact that I was left wanting more of Dear me, I was… speaks more to the quality of its content than any other compliments I could give it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In some ways, it feels counterintuitive to write a review of Dear me, I was… — a title which centres upon capturing heavy feelings that can’t be so easily put into words. However, it’s not every day that a visual novel successfully manages to craft a moving narrative about art, life, and the passage of time solely on the merit of its visual and musical storytelling.</p>
<p>Even if the game itself remains silent, Dear me, I was… is worth talking about.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A lot of thought went into when to release Battlefield 6, but EA continued to target this Fall, regardless of Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">Variety</a>, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele commented on the release date of the highly anticipated next entry in the first-person shooter series, saying that they <em>"have always have been heads down, unblinking about this fall and executing at a level of excellence,"</em> working hard with the development team to not get distracted by anything else happening around them. With the level of effort and investement put into the game, however, the last thing the publisher wanted was to put Battlefield 6 in harm's way or too close to the release of something really large, so EA did have their eye on Grand Theft Auto VI, and were thinking about different scenarios, but weren't allowing these scenarios to impact schedules or development.</p>



<p>The confidence EA is showing in Battlefield 6 definitely seems to be warranted. Kai recently had the chance to try out the game and has found it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">a return to proper form</a> after the blunders of the last entries in the series. </p>



<p><em>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs.</em></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">October 10</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is pretty sure plenty of people will hate his upcoming release OD, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much about it. Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and Udo Kier are all tied to the project, and there is also some involvement with director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>The game creator has now shared a little bit more about OD, though I really do mean a little. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">Ssense</a>, Kojima said OD was "something totally different", and people are going to either "love it or hate it".</p>
<p>The publication added Kojima will of course digest all the various reactions to OD when it comes out, citing platforms like YouTube and X, but as for the actual reception to the game when it releases? Well, apparently that won't matter to Kojima, at least for another decade or so.</p>
<p>"The real evaluations come after - 10 or 20 years from now," Kojima told the publication. This attitude isn't new for Kojima. Earlier this year, following positive playtests for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima said he wasn't "interested in appealing to the mass market"</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting, the critical reception to the first Death Stranding has warmed since its release, so perhaps we'll see the same with OD in future.</p>

</figure>
<p>As well as OD on Xbox, Kojima also has an action-espionage game in the works with PlayStation known as Physint. This game came about when the designer - who is among many things known for his part in bringing the Metal Gear games to life - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">experienced a period of sickness and surgery which when combined with thoughts of his own mortality convinced him to reassess what his priorities are</a>, and instead do something fans had been asking him to do for years.</p>
<p>"Every day on social media, from users all around the world, people have been asking me to create another Metal Gear and stuff like that," Kojima said last year.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Kojima released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, to wide acclaim. As for Konami's upcoming remake of the third Metal Gear Solid game, no, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Kojima will not be playing it</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo’s latest quarterly report has come with the first sales figures for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is now confirmed to have set a towering new record for sales through the first month.</p>
<p>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process – they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles, from their mid-November launches to the end of December. Of course, Sony was struggling to meet demand in 2020 through a semiconductor shortage, but this is still seriously impressive stuff.</p>


<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold incredibly well, with a close to 100% attach rate. As the main exclusive title and primary reason to buy a Switch 2, and the fact that the game was bundled in as part of hardware bundles, the 5.63 million copies of Mario Kart World sold makes a 96.7% attach rate.</p>
<p>While the new console took the headlines, the original Nintendo Switch continues to plug away as well, with 0.98 million further sales in the last three months that bumps the total sales up to 153.10 million, and it is now sure to eclipse the Nintendo DS 154.02 million consoles sold by the end of this year. Given how sales are likely to tail off, it’s unlikely that the PS2’s 160 million will be overtaken, though.</p>

            <p>Avast, fellow salty sea-dogs. Some legally-minded landlubbers may have had words with Edward Kenway, captain of The Jackdaw and protagonist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a>. Well, Kenway's voice actor Matt Ryan at any rate, who's been filmed at a convention saying that Ubisoft threatened to sue him over a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">previous video from another convention</a> in which he teased a remake of the game.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, this is the Black Flag remake the publisher haven't confirmed is coming, but has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I don't know, mate," Ryan said when asked about said remake in this latest instance of a convention goer pointing a phone at him while he signs stuff. "Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [points towards the phone filming this exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. Then the company threatened to sue me. So, [now] I say nothing."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear whether Ryan's unaware he's being filmed this time around, as he does directly acknowledge that the convention goer who's doing so has their phone camera pointed at him. This latest clip was originally uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> and since looks to have been taken down there, but not before it was reposted onto what remains of Twitter.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>We've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>It's not nice to hear about anyone allegedly having Lionel Hutzes on their case over something like this, so here's hoping Ryan doesn't end up in any more hot water over this latest clip. If you approach him at a convention with your phone pointed right at his mug in the near future and try to chat Black Flag remakes, I'd expect he might have less to say.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease]]></content:encoded>

<p>As satisfying as a successful real-time strategy game campaign can be, dealing with a complex RTS map can often be overwhelming. Keeping track of multiple far-flung resource-production bases, groups of units, upgrade trees, and surprise encounters with the enemy requires a level of attention-splitting that can strain even the best multitaskers.</p>
<p>Then there's <em>The King Is Watching</em>, which condenses the standard real-time strategy production loop into an easy-to-understand single-screen interface, complete with automatic battles. The game's unique resource management system—combined with well-designed, self-balancing difficulty and randomized upgrades that keep each run fresh—makes <em>The King Is Watching</em> one of the most enjoyable pick-up-and-play strategy titles I've encountered in a long time.</p>
<h2>What is the king watching, exactly?</h2>
<p>The bulk of the action in <em>The King Is Watching</em> takes place on a small, 4x4 grid of squares representing your castle. That's where you'll place blueprint tiles from your hand that then start producing the basic and refined resources necessary to place even more blueprints. Those resources also power the factories that crank out defensive units that automatically fight to protect your castle from periodic waves of enemies (in adorable pixelated animations that take place on a battlefield to the right of your castle).</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2109618"><p>
              A lot of good resource tiles there, but the king can only look at five squares at a time here.

  </div>

      </figure>

<p>Sounds simple enough. But the entire castle can't be actively productive at once. Instead, only a few contiguous tiles within the area of the "king's gaze" can make resources and/or units at any one time.</p>
<p>That means you have to constantly and actively drag and rotate your "gaze" around your castle, prioritizing the resources and units you need immediately and leaving others that can wait for the king's attention. You have to be careful with the relative positioning of your blueprints so that units and resources that complement each other can be produced in the same "gaze" without a lot of unproductive downtime (say, when you've hit your unit limit) or resource droughts.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>You might start off with one corner of the grid devoted to basic resources and another to basic unit production, shifting your gaze quickly between the two as your unit numbers and/or resource stockpiles dwindle. Later, you might add a market to generate the gold you'll need for the squares that produce stronger units or a crystal mine that will help supply powerful magical units you create later in the run.</p>

      </figure>

<p>You might also invest your treasure in upgrades that make certain tiles produce more quickly or on global upgrades that expand your gaze or let you station more troops on the field at once. And as your grid fills up, you must figure out which underpowered or less-useful tiles to destroy to make space for the more powerful blueprints you've hopefully earned or generated to replace them.</p>

<h2>Try to keep up</h2>
<p>Shifting your gaze and adjusting your production tiles plays out like a simple puzzle game, requiring effective juggling of both time and space to be maximally efficient. You need to constantly split your attention between your present resource and unit needs and your near- and far-future plans for upgrades. As frantic as this can get, it never feels unmanageable, thanks in large part to an excellent user interface that packs practically everything you need to know onto a single screen, no camera-fiddling or complex keyboard shortcuts required.</p>
<p><em>The King Is Watching</em> also makes use of an ingenious kind of partially self-selecting difficulty system, where you periodically pick from a randomized set of "prophecies" to "predict" how many and which enemies will come in the next few waves (and which potential upgrades they might give you when they're gone). This leads to a delightfully fraught balance of risk and reward, forcing you to ride the edge of survivability in each wave. Choose too many enemies and you could be overwhelmed before your defensive units are built up. Choose too few and you won't earn the requisite upgrades needed to work through the overpowered boss waves later.</p>

<p>Those inter-wave upgrades are also randomized in each run, adding some roguelike unpredictability that means no two play sessions develop quite the same way. You have to be flexible, adapting to the blueprints and units you're given, while being willing to abandon plans that are no longer feasible.</p>
<p>Between waves, you'll often get the opportunity to buy emergency resource drops, useful upgrades that last through the whole run, or one-time spells that can strengthen your units or hinder the opposition. Figuring out the best potential upgrade paths requires a lot of trial and error, and you'll need a little luck in drawing some of the more powerful upgrade options. While experience and skill can make things more manageable, some runs end up a lot more winnable than others.</p>
<p>Playing through successful waves also earns you tokens you can spend between runs on permanent upgrades (including crucial expansions of that 4x4 grid) and new selectable kings with their own unique gaze shapes and special powers. But even as these upgrades make it easier to succeed in successive runs, the game cranks up the "threat level" in turn to raise the enemy strength level (and the stakes) accordingly.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZXjQRcu2B8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>That kind of self-balancing means <em>The King Is Watching</em> always manages to feel engaging without coming off as totally unfair. And individual runs are zippy enough to not wear out their welcome; you can make it through a full run of two or three bosses in about 30 minutes or so, especially if you use the "fast forward" option to speed up the routine resource production between enemy waves.</p>
<p>Best of all, those 30 minutes are so dense with important decisions and split-second management of your kingly gaze that you never have time to feel bored. <em>The King Is Watching</em> perfectly rides the fine line between engrossing and overwhelming, making it perfect for quick, lunch-break-sized brain breaks that combine positional reasoning, reflexes, and strategic planning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA Online Could Soon Require Age Verification to Play or Access Select Features]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-online-age-verification/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-online-could-soon-require-age-verification-to-play-or-access-select-features.1259460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly planning to implement age verification in GTA Online to play the game or access some of the online game's features.</p>



<p>As reported by Tez2 on X, users may need to verify their age in the future to play the game or access certain features like phone messages, text chat, and Snapmatic. Tez2 couldn't say which regions could be targeted for these age verification checks, but there's little doubt players in the UK will be the first to be impacted by age verification if it goes into effect, considering the enforcement of the Online Safety Act is expected to ramp up in the coming months.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Jokes aside, Rockstar is planning to implement age assurance checks in the near future, rolling them out by region.</p><p>You may need to verify your age to access <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTAOnline</a>, or certain features, like phone messages, text chat, Snapmatic, may be restricted until you verify your age. <a href="https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh">https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/QYVaydlbhZ">pic.twitter.com/QYVaydlbhZ</a></p></div>— Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1951058585359634459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although age checks are yet to become mandatory, select publishers and developers already started implementing some form of age verification ahead of time, like Roblox and Epic Games, to prevent younger players from accessing to some features like voice and or text chat, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to do the same in GTA Online, considering the game is constantly under intense scrutiny due to its setting and content. As the developer is also said to be working on a new version of their online game to coincide with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-online-sold-separately-30-fps-target/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year, it will be interesting to see how age verification will impact this new project in some way.</p>



<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game's latest updates on its official website.</p>

                <p>The first big game of the Switch 2 era has emerged, as Nintendo has sold almost as many units of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> as actual Switch 2 consoles. In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo reported</a> that it had sold 8.67 million units, with Mario Kart World being responsible for 5.63 million of those sales. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">This is almost as many units sold as Switch 2 consoles sold</a>, indicating a very high attach rate.</p><p>To put this into context, it is worth noting that Nintendo launched the Switch 2 with a bundle deal that included Mario Kart World. Given that the game has an MSRP of $80--and Nintendo rarely drops the price on its evergreen titles--it did make financial sense to grab the bundle and save $30 in the process.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The game also has a long way to go before it dethrones Nintendo's best-selling game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch game has reached lifetime sales of 68.86 million units, but these are still very early days for Mario Kart World. There will be some competition on the way with Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A this year, but it'll be interesting to see if Mario Kart World will enjoy the same level of longevity as its predecessor. There are also plenty of third-party games on the way, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">as this week's Nintendo Direct</a> showed off 25 games headed to the Switch 2 throughout the year and well into 2026.</p><p>Overall, business is good for Nintendo as sales during the quarter that ended on June 30 reached roughly $3.8 billion and operating profit grew 4% to $378 million. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is still predicting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> by March 2026, even during turbulent financial times brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

            <p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means Mario Kart World accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>

<p>Clearly the console and racing game bundle has proven a popular option for customers. Mario Kart World was the primary launch game for the new console, and was also available to buy separately.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sales of the original Switch console have now reached 153.10m units.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">Nintendo expects to sell 4.5m Switch consoles</a>, which would see the console usurping the Nintendo DS as the company's highest-selling piece of hardware - it's now less than 1m sales behind. That's still quite a way from the PS2, though, which is estimated to have sold 160m units as the best selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Overall, Nintendo's net sales grew by 132.1 percent year-on-year thanks to the Switch 2's launch, while gross profit increased by 21.4 percent to 185.1bn yen. The gross profit margin declined due to a lower profit margin of the Switch 2 compared with the previous console.</p>
<p>Digital sales decreased by 13.5 percent, but still account for 59.3 percent of all software sales. Nintendo attributes this to a "decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software".</p>
<p>Nintendo has not changed its financial forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, where it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles worldwide. This has not been impacted by US tariff measures, echoing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">statement from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in May</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will be released on Switch consoles on 16th October, as one of Nintendo's key first-party games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> remains a 2025 release without a specific launch date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo revealed more third-party games due for release this year - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">everything shown at the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Battlefield fanbase experiences the rollercoaster highs and lows of game releases like almost no other. Over the past 15 years, each game’s launch is greeted with a degree of dismay, the team having to go back and pour even more effort in to rectify issues and pull it into shape, and then, just as it’s become a beloved entry in the series, you crest the big drop and go hurtling back down to the depths of gaming despair as a new game arrives to start the journey all over again. But there’s hope for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Dreams that this beloved open war shooter really is back to the rose tinted glory days of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a>. Are we back? I think we might be back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battlefield 6 brings us a contemporary war setting, taking place in an utterly implausible 2027, from a current geopolitical viewpoint, where the steadfast bastion of Western military cooperation that is NATO is suddenly under threat from…um… a really rich private military corporation? No China, no Russia, it’s the mercenaries of Pax Armata that are the baddies, managing to chip away at the allies, the war that breaks out stretching from the Middle East, from Egypt, through Gibraltar and even coming to US shores with a battle in Brooklyn. Truthfully, it doesn’t matter who the goodies and the baddies are for the multiplayer, but it does feel a bit toetippy and safe after the games of the early 2010s.</p>


<p>What really matters is what the combat and action is like, and here it’s classic Battlefield. There’s four classes – Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon – and you’re in squads of up to four, trying to use your different roles and skills to complement one another and with a squad leader marking objectives to try and coordinate your efforts. Assault is about crashing into situations, able to boost themselves with a shot of adrenaline and coming with two main weapons, Engineer has the rockets and blow torch, Support bundles together the old Medic healing, ammo resupply and barricades, and Recon is all about scoping out the enemy with drones, placing spawn points, and the like. There’s the usual remixing of familiar abilities into these four buckets, and outside of the smushed together duties for the Support class, it’s a lot like the good old days… specifically the good days of Bad Company 2’s classes. Assault does have a personal health stim, but needs Engineer or Recon’s C4 to take out tanks and Support for healing and ammo.</p>


<p>Alongside the gadgets of your class, there’s also a new score-based perk system in Field Specs that rewards you with passive and active boosts. These start small, like starting your own health regen when you revive an ally as a Support, hampering enemy vehicle repairs when damaging them as an Engineer, or building up to a top tier ability that you manually trigger, like Assault’s Combat Stimulant which highlights nearby sounds and reveals enemies. These feel like they’ll be gameplay style enhancements instead of wholesale class mods, but we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>But there’s still some controversy. You see, where weapons used to be locked to particular classes in Battlefield V and before, that’s no longer the case. Each class still has a “signature” weapon type, and there’s boosters for embracing that synergy, so engineers have better hip-fire control with the SMGs, and Assault can draw and switch weapons quicker with an assault rifle, but you’ll also have the freedom to pick from the full selection of weapons. It’s something that a vocal part of the community has railed against for months, but really it makes sense. Having weapon freedom makes it a smidgeon more likely that someone will sacrifice being an Assault when your squad is faced by a tank.</p>

<p>Bouncing back and forth between roles and weapons, it’s a bit like putting on an old pair of slippers, but there’s plenty of fine details to adjust to as well. The one I particularly appreciate was how marking enemies works. Instead of spamming a ping button, you instead mark enemies by shooting at them, in turn giving away your position. I wish you could still just point out a tank, but this is a great change in general. I also really like the new revive system, where you can drag a fallen buddy out from the open and into cover, making you both at least be slow moving targets.</p>
<p>And if we’re really getting into the weeds, I love that the end of match screen that highlights squads and achievements has a line chart representation of how tickets were depleted through a match of Conquest.</p>

<p>But really there’s just all the bombast of Battlefield’s trademarked all-out warfare. Infantry plays a big role, but so too do vehicles, tanks, helicopters and fighter jets. I can absolutely see myself spending time manning the LMG for a buddy driving a tank, holding down a key position in Conquest and hopping out to fix them up when we take hits. But I also just enjoyed marauding, hopping onto an AA emplacement to take out a pesky helicopter.</p>
<p>The map I played a couple matches on was on the rocky mountainside of Liberation Peak, with a set of six control points littered with military defences and buildings. There was some of the destruction available here, but it will really be for the urban battles where this factor will be felt the most, where entire facades of buildings can collapse in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 will arrive with 9 maps, and almost as many game modes. Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough return as the series staples, but there’s the small ball of TDM, Squad DM, Domination, KOTH and something new called Escalation. And of course there will be seasons of content with new maps, modes and events.</p>
<p>So, is Battlefield back? At first blush, it certainly feels like it might be. Thankfully it won’t be long before we can spend more time with it, with two beta weekends kicking off in August, and there’s sure to be plenty more to be said about this once we’ve played more. But also, there’s stuff still to really be revealed and explored that will only emerge for the full release. How are weapon unlocks going to play out? How with Field Specs modify each class? What balance changes can DICE really make from the beta to the full game in time for October?</p>

			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>

In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, Nintendo says it sold 6 million Switch 2 units globally in the seven weeks since launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">which has led to several records being broken</a>.</p><p>The hybrid console has been a hot commodity since it went on sale, exceeding the expectations of Nintendo. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">The company says it still expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current financial year, which ends in March 2026. Meanwhile, Nintendo sold 0.98 million Switch consoles, pushing the lifetime sales of that device up to 153.10 million units sold.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542007"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 lifetime sales to date</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4542007-witch-2-sales.jpg"></figure><p>"Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo said</a>. "We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible."</p><p>In the games department, things are also looking good as Nintendo says it has reached sales of 8.67 million units. Mario Kart World made the bulk of these sales at 5.63 million units sold, but that's not too surprising given that the game was available via a bundle console deal.</p><p>Looking ahead, there'll be plenty more reasons to grab a Switch 2 this year with exclusive games like Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">Nintendo also held a Direct livestream this week</a>, dedicated to games from third-party studios and developers. While there weren't too many surprises, there are some interesting games coming out soon like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-announced-coming-to-switch-2-next-year/1100-6533579/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-revealed-for-switch-2-release-date-announced/1100-6533584/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, and Borderlands 4.</p>
