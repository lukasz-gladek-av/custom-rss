<p>Will focus on expanding Nintendo movie adaptations into other mediums</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6ef5aeb870d8/nintendo-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250827.html">has announced</a> that it is renaming its subsidiary company 'Warpstar Inc.' to 'Nintendo Stars Inc.' following its consolidation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Warpstar Inc. – founded on 31st July 2001 – had previously been a joint venture between Nintendo and Hal Laboratory to oversee the <strong>Kirby</strong> franchise, expanding it into other mediums such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby:_Right_Back_at_Ya!">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a> anime series back in 2001. It became an official subsidiary of Nintendo on <strong>1st April 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for its function going forward, Nintendo Stars will be responsible for "the ancillary-use business tied to films that feature Nintendo Intellectual Property". In simpler words, then, it'll focus on the expansion of movie adaptations into other ventures, such as events, merchandise, licensing – that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We know, of course, that Nintendo has two upcoming movie projects in the works: the 2026 sequel to T<strong>he Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, and the 2027 live-action adaptation of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. The company recently provided our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">first glimpse at the cast for the Zelda movie</a>, with Bo Baragson playing the role of Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth playing the role of Link.</p>
<p>Nintendo Stars will also continue its work in the expansion of the Kirby franchise into other mediums. The subsidiary has literal decades of experience at this point, so Nintendo is keen to utilise its expertise, aiming to "strengthen the relationship between Nintendo and its customers".</p>
<p>Our opinion? 'Nintendo Stars' doesn't have quite the same ring as 'Warpstar', but hey, we'll take it.</p>

            <p>EA has finally revealed an early access release date for Skate. The much-anticipated skateboarding game will be releasing on 16th September, for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
<p>Skate will be free-to-play with cross progression and cross platform play, with paid cosmetics able to be snagged by those willing to fork out some cash for outfits and the like. The early access version will launch with four neighbourhoods to explore. The game is also fully open world and always online, so you and other skaters will be rolling around completing challenges and inevitably falling over together.</p>
<p>As for post-launch support, the game will be receiving seasonal updates which will feature "fresh challenges, cosmetics, music, world updates, and new events".</p>

<p>With this reveal, there's still no words on the release date for the iOS and Android version of the game. But at least we'll all finally be able to try out Skate ourselves after months of info drops and little teases. The game has been playable behind the scenes as part of closed tests, but for the average person it's remained a mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/itsuno-left-capcom-didnt-want-make-dmc-dd-sequels/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itsuno-left-capcom-because-he-didn%E2%80%99t-want-to-make-dmc-and-dd-sequels-until-retirement.1281468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, news <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-brings-several-ex-capcom-developers-to-lightspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke</a> that Hideaki Itsuno had recruited several fellow former CAPCOM developers to his new LightSpeed Japan Studio, which is also opening a new office in Osaka in addition to the existing one in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Now, through <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-director-hideaki-itsuno-explains-why-he-left-capcom-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Itsuno has finally explained why he decided to leave CAPCOM around a year ago. As it turns out, it was mainly because the Japanese publisher would have put him on more Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma sequels, while the game designer wanted to do something new before he retires.</p>



<p><em>For me, based on my age, this is my last chance. The gaming industry has decreased the number of AAA releases, and I was asked to create a new AAA by Lightspeed. I’m not young anymore, so more than “now it’s the right moment,” it’s more like, “this is my last chance” to challenge myself. For Capcom, creating Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma sequels is always going to be the top priority, and keeping in mind that making a game takes 4 to 5 years, this might be my last big opportunity.</em></p>



<p><em>Before you realized you are working on making the Devil May Cry 6 or 7. It’s not like I don’t want to make them, I do, but it’s hard to balance the time it takes with the personal satisfaction of making them, and with Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon’s Dogma 2, I already did what I wanted to make.</em></p>



<p>It's definitely an understandable sentiment. Itsuno is certainly not the only veteran developer who recently decided to leave a big triple-A studio to work on something else of his own creation.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the developer says he is satisfied with how Dragon's Dogma 2 turned out (though personally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd have to disagree on that</a>), and that he got more inspired by games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle than other action games after the release of Devil May Cry 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-sets-new-record-for-concurrent-users-on-a-gaming-platform-beating-even-steam.1281462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last Saturday, around 8 AM Pacific Time, Roblox <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bloxy.news/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> a new record for concurrent users on a gaming platform: 47.3 million users were online on August 23. That's 6.1 million concurrent users more than the peak registered by Valve's Steam platform in March: 41.2 million concurrent users. Earlier that month, Steam had <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 40 million concurrent users milestone</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox's new peak is a massive jump compared to its previous record of 32.7 million users, which was set on another Saturday, July 19. Setting two records in the span of a month shows that the platform continues to grow nearly nineteen years after its original debut, which took place on September 1, 2006.</p>



<p>The game creation platform currently has two dominators: Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot. Together, they accounted for over 37 million of those concurrent users, meaning that more than 77% of the userbase was playing one of those games. Grow a Garden was the leader, with a peak of 22 million concurrent players, also a record for the highest concurrent peak ever recorded in a single game.</p>



<p>Originally developed by a sixteen-year-old player known only as BMWLux, Grow a Garden subsequently saw Splitting Point Studios and Do Big Studios purchasing shares and participating in its development. It's essentially an idle farming simulator where players start with a small plot of land and watch their plants grow into lovely flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Players can harvest and sell their produce to earn Sheckles, which can be used to purchase seeds, gear, eggs, and decorative items. They can also complete quests and participate in seasonal events to earn free seeds, gear, pets, and decorative items.</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot also attracts many players to Roblox, with an estimated peak of 15 million concurrent players. This game was made by a user known as SpyderSammy, in partnership with another user known as do_small and developer Do Big Studios. It is described as a sort of tycoon experience where the goal of the game is to steal Brainrots from other players to earn money, which can be used to buy more Brainrots. However, others will try to steal yours, so you must defend them.</p>



<p>As a reminder, a couple of weeks ago, the state of Louisiana <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, alleging that it is a breeding ground for sex predators and that its owners do not employ sufficient safety protocols to protect children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-has-already-beaten-battlefield-6-and-it%E2%80%99s-because-of-%E2%80%98autopilot-purchasing%E2%80%99-analyst-says.1281459/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite comments suggesting that Battlefield 6 will ‘boot stomp’ Call of Duty this year, many believe the impending conflict between Black Ops 7 and EA’s new Battlefield title has already been decided. In a recent report published as part of the Alinea Analytics newsletter, it was suggested that Black Ops 7 will outsell Battlefield because of consumer habits and nothing more.</p>



<p>The report spoke of ‘autopilot purchasing’, with Call of Duty fans buying the new release year in, year out, even if they’re displeased with the offering. That’s why Battlefield 6 won’t ‘win’ this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-battlefield-6-beat-call-of-duty">Can Battlefield 6 Beat Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> discussed whether Battlefield 6 could stand firm as a ‘COD killer’, a term that has been lobbied a lot in recent years. Once upon a time, XDefiant was poised as a COD killer, and we all know how that went…</p>



<p>Alinea’s expert analysts pulled a number out of the hat, revealing that 60% of beta-based wishlisters of Battlefield 6 have played a Call of Duty game on Steam, which is a damning enough number right out the gate. The team admitted that Battlefield 6 could do better than any other game in franchise history, but it still won’t be enough to topple Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott of Alinea put it perfectly in the report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>COD<strong>&nbsp;is still dominant despite all this</strong>. Its core audience still loves the game and buys it every damn year. And that isn’t going to change just because&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is rad and tracking incredibly well.</p>



<p>For many gamers,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is an annual ritual. Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>&nbsp;every year without hesitation. This “autopilot purchasing” habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elliott went on to explain ‘that&nbsp;<strong>players will buy it even if they complain about it</strong>.’ It also doesn’t help Battlefield’s situation that Black Ops 7 is guaranteed to be a day-one title on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. When Black Ops 6 was released on Game Pass last year, it was the single biggest day for new subscriptions on the platform.</p>



<p>I’m of the standpoint that Battlefield 6 <strong>doesn’t need to beat Black Ops 7. </strong>I’m more than comfortable with both games existing alongside each other, and even Battlefield’s developers stressed the same thing. They serve unique demographics in a few ways, and I’ll play both and make my mind up later as to which I prefer.</p>

The deal was inked recently, and it was confirmed that Atari will re-release these games under the new publishing arm that the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in April 2024.</p>



<p>The five games now owned by Atari will likely provide a nostalgia hit for Ubisoft fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ubisoft-games-does-atari-own">What Ubisoft Games Does Atari Own?</h2>



<p>Atari has secured the IP rights for five <strong>Ubisoft </strong>games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cold Fear (2005)</li>



<li>I Am Alive (2012)</li>



<li>Child of Eden (2011)</li>



<li>Grow Home (2015)</li>



<li>Grow Up (2016)</li>
</ul>



<p>I’m particularly excited about I Am Alive, a 2012 blink-and-you’ll-miss-it post-apocalyptic survival game pieced together primarily by Ubisoft Shanghai and Darkworks, a studio that also worked on Cold Fear, which sadly closed its doors in 2011.</p>



<p>I Am Alive wasn’t an award-winning game by any means, but it offered players a perspective of a shattered world with a moral lens overlay. It took a whopping seven years to develop the game, and when it was done, it offered just a few hours of gameplay on a digital-only release.</p>



<p>I’ve always been eager for a follow-up to I Am Alive, which I feel is a criminally underrated game. Here’s a trailer for the title:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> on the new IP deal, Ubisoft’s Deborah Papiernik, VP of New Business, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time.</p>



<p>Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the sentiment was Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel.</p>



<p>We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Niantic's popular augmented reality mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> will be getting an update in October, raising the level cap from 50 to 80.</p>
<p>This update will drop on <strong>15th October 2025</strong> and will apparently make the levelling journey "more fun and engaging" by adding new rewards, new cosmetics, and more for each levelling milestone. This update will also see players "jump in level based on their total earned XP". Niantic further states how "no player will go down in level".</p>
<p>Apart from this, there's also going to be a special limited-time update with XP bonuses and Timed Research taking place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<hr>
<p>Below is a breakdown of everything trainers can expect (via the official Pokémon GO game site):</p>
<ul>
<li>The level cap will increase from level 50 to level 80. The overall leveling curve from level 1 to 80 will be rebalanced, and players can earn levels more frequently.</li>
<li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed.</li>
<li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80.</li>
<li>Players at level 70 and higher have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players.</li>
<li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokémon, items, and Gifts. This includes new avatar items starting at level 25!</li>
<li>Based on previously earned experience, some players may automatically jump in level on October 15. Those players will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time. Details about which players will jump in level, and by how many levels, will be shared later.</li>
<li>No players will go down in level, but the amount of XP needed to reach the next level may change depending on your current level. Stay tuned for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also earn the following rewards <em>before</em> 15th October 2025. These items will not be available for levelling up after this date. This also applies to the Level 50 Jacket.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon GO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c16bcf699db4/pokemon-go.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's the rundown about the XP Celebration event (including the bonuses). This event runs from now until 14th October 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>2× Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent Throws</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li>
</ul>
<p>Timed Research will also be available to trainers who are Level 5 and above, with the chance to earn over 7 million XP. A level 47 Level-Up Research task is also being adjusted, so instead of requiring trainers to "explore 25km in a week eight times", you'll now only have to do it twice.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows the recent arrival of Eternatus and the introduction of Max Battles.

</section></header><section>

<p>At the end of July, Nintendo released an update for the Switch Online Super Nintendo app adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a>.</p>
<p>This update included mouse support (for Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers and USB mouse compatibility), as well as the ability to remap buttons. The same update also featured mouse support for the existing releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed this news at the time, Nintendo has now released an official trailer in English highlighting these new features. You can see everything in motion across games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and Mario Paint. Apart from this, this update also apparently improved the SNES app's CRT filter.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/surprise-the-n64-app-is-also-getting-some-enhancements-on-switch-2">updated the N64 app</a> as well with additional features like a rewind ability and a new CRT filter. Additionally, GameCube Classics were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gamecube/chibi-robo">added to the 'Expansion Pack' service</a> on Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> joining the service last week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In total, there are 49 trophies and achievements to earn in NHL 26. The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>You can check out all of the trophies and how to earn them below courtesy of <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36114-nhl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>



<p>Are you planning on trying to earn every achievement and trophy in NHL 26? Let us know down below and take the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/return-to-silent-hill-gets-official-teaser-trailer.1281348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill, a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2, has released the first teaser. The film, which hits theaters on January 23rd, 2026, looks to capture the magic of the iconic sequel. We had seen glimpses before last year during Silent Hill Transmission, but nothing concrete. </p>



<p>The film comes from director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006. Last we had heard about Return to Silent Hill, it got its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-comes-to-theaters-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official release date of January</a>, but no pictures or footage came of it. Regardless, we now have our first look at the upcoming adaptation, and it looks rather interesting.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-brings-silent-hill-2-to-life-in-film">Return to Silent Hill Brings Silent Hill 2 To Life in Film</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Return to Silent Hill - Official Teaser Trailer (2025) Jeremy Irvine, Hannah Emily Anderson" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eej34Jw7woA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, shown above, we get a brief glimpse into the world of Return to Silent Hill. As the film is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2 (though the trailer doesn’t seem to indicate that), the plot remains the same. Protagonist James Sunderland, played by Jeremy Irvine, goes to the eerie town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his recently deceased wife, Laura. What follows is a bit too spoilery, but it does involve grotesque monsters and, of course, the iconic Pyramid Head. It looks like it may not be a direct adaptation, as there are a few things not from the games in it. However, it is a teaser, so expect more of a concrete plot come the full trailer.</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 is widely regarded as one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-silent-hill-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scariest games of the generation</a>. Last year, Bloober Team and Konami released a remake of the game, which was heavily praised and was up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/495868/2024-award-winners-game-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dozens of awards</a>. Now, the Silent Hill series is readying the next generation with Silent Hill f, releasing on September 25th, 2025. Following that will be Bloober Team’s return with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-silent-hill-remake-development-bloober-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remake of Silent Hill</a>, announced earlier this year. Until then, fans can look forward to seeing Silent Hill 2 on the big screen in January.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-could-launch-in-2027-2028-chris-roberts-says-squadron-42-is-%E2%80%98top-gun-meets-star-wars%E2%80%99-hopes-for-gta-6-like-event.1281315/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For well over a decade, Star Citizen creator Chris Roberts did not want to attach any definite release windows to his extremely ambitious sci-fi online multiplayer space simulation game. That has seemingly changed, as Canadian website LaPresse <a href="https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/2025-08-22/jeu-video/le-studio-web-turbulent-devient-cloud-imperium-games-montreal.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> in an interview with Roberts that the game is expected to launch either in 2027 or 2028.</p>



<p>Considering that the game's early access for the persistent universe module launched on December 23, 2017, the early access would end around the ten-year mark, possibly threatening the existing record of 7 Days to Die: the survival horror game by The Fun Pimps launched in early access on December 13, 2013, while version 1.0 became available on July 25, 2024. </p>



<p>Star Citizen, currently in Alpha 4.3.0, <span>will be preceded by the single-player campaign Squadron 42. As you might recall, Cloud Imperium Games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;during last year's CitizenCon event that Squadron 42 would</span> be released in 2026. In the aforementioned interview, Chris Roberts expressed hopes that it will be nearly as hyped as a launch event as Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI, describing Squadron 42 as Top Gun mixed with Star Wars.</p>



<p><em>We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event. Other than GTA 6, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game.</em> <em>It's Top Gun meets Star Wars. </em></p>



<p>Squadron 42 does include an ensemble cast of Hollywood stars who undoubtedly wanted to be paid well to lend their voices and likenesses to the game. Here's a comprehensive list:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gary Oldman</li>



<li>Mark Hamill</li>



<li>Gillian Anderson</li>



<li>Mark Strong</li>



<li>Liam Cunningham</li>



<li>Andy Serkis</li>



<li>John Rhys-Davies</li>



<li>Jack Huston</li>



<li>Eleanor Tomlinson</li>



<li>Harry Treadaway</li>



<li>Sophie Wu</li>



<li>Damson Idris</li>



<li>Eric Wareheim</li>



<li>Rhona Mitra</li>



<li>Henry Cavill</li>



<li>Ben Mendelsohn</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> came out over a decade ago and has been running on PlayStation 4 since soon after it launched. Sony’s last-gen hardware won’t be able to support Square Enix’s MMORPG forever, though, and director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida recently explained why.</p> <p>“My basic stance is that I do want to continue supporting hardware which has grown old,” he said in <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">an interview with Feed4Gamers</a> (via <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107343/sony-loosens-ps4-os-rules-for-final-fantasy-xiv-but-the-mmorpg-may-be-forced-to-drop-ps4-soon/index.html">TweakTown</a>). “But I do have one concern, and that’s regarding the OS of the PlayStation 4, and this is regarding the hardware regulations which were made by Sony. These regulations are related to the limit of the data, and because there’s that limit of the data, well, we are continually incorporating updates for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and we are now approaching that limit.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And so for this limit that’s in place, we have been asking Sony Interactive Entertainment from our side to increase that just for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and they have kindly been doing that so far. But they’ve told us now that they are also reaching their limits. So I will repeat myself: I do want to provide support for platforms as long as possible. However, there will eventually come a time when the hardware is at its limits in terms of its technology, and at that point in time we would have to provide an end to the service on that hardware. But I will be sure to provide clear reasoning for that decision when I communicate it to the players.</p></blockquote> <p>According to Yoshida, Sony’s already been making exceptions to its standard developer rules in order to accommodate new content for <em>FF14</em>. The game has received several major updates since last year’s <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion, including this month’s patch 7.3, The Promise of Tomorrow. It’s unclear just how much wiggle room is still left for further upgrades and content drops.</p>

 <h2>When is<em> Final Fantasy 14</em>‘s next expansion coming?</h2> <p>Square Enix has been cagey on the timing of its next expansion, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1m2cj8g/fan_fest_schedule_still_not_announced_80/">with speculation from some fans</a> that it could arrive as late as spring 2027. Yoshida teased that there will at least be an update on the date for FF14 Fan Fest 2026 on the 10-year anniversary of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> this week.</p> <p>Other big multiplayer games <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">like <em>PUBG</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-ps4-ps5-hoyoverse-support-2000615960">and <em>Genshin Impact</em></a> are both dropping support for last-gen consoles in the coming months. While<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is still coming to PS4 and Xbox One this fall, other big annual franchises like<em> MLB: The Show</em> and <em>Madden NFL</em> have all ditched the aging hardware. Considering we’re nearly five years into the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S lifecycles, the only surprising thing is that these moves didn’t come sooner.</p> <p>Originally released on the PS3 in 2013, <em>FF14 </em>left that console behind at the time of the <em>Stormblood</em> expansion in 2017, a departure for which Square Enix <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/57i207/ps3_support_to_end_in_40/">provided eight months of notice.</a> My guess is that update 8.0, whenever it arrives, might similarly mark the end of the MMORPG’s journey on PS4. And by that point, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">PS6 will probably be just around the corner</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>On March 4, it was announced that defunct publisher Acclaim had been resurrected (again), this time as an indie publisher. After months of waiting, it's time to learn what new games will bear that iconic rainbow logo thanks to the publisher's first digital showcase.</p><p>On September 10, Acclaim will host the Play Acclaim showcase to reveal its lineup of upcoming titles. The news follows a series of teaser trailers posted to the publisher’s official YouTube channel (such as the one below), which is where the presentation will be broadcast. Play Acclaim will air at 11:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. ET.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Acclaim was a household name in the ‘80s and ‘90s as a publisher for many well-known games and franchises, including Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, Turok, numerous WWE titles, and even more licensed games. The publisher closed its doors in 2004 due to poor sales and failure to pay royalties to its licensors. The brand was acquired and revived in 2006 as Acclaim Games, a totally different entity focused on offering free online games from other territories. Acclaim Games was then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/08/28/acclaim-shuts-its-doors-again.aspx">shuttered in 2010</a>.</p><p>This revived Acclaim will focus on the independent game scene, promising to provide funding, marketing, and PR support to smaller studios. Acclaim’s advisory board consists of Russell Binder at Striker Entertainment, Mark Caplan at Ridge Partners, and pro wrestler Jeff Jarrett at Global Force Entertainment.</p><p>“We’re not here to chase ghosts,” said Alex Josef, CEO of Acclaim in today’s press release. “We’re here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what’s coming through is something exciting and different.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/26/the-newly-revived-acclaim-is-hosting-a-showcase-next-month]]></content:encoded>

      <div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched its crowdfunding campaign for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em>. The newest edition, originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monte-cook-games-has-announced-new-edition-of-their-cypher-rpg-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in July</a>, promotes a streamlined version of the award-winning TTRPG system. The campaign was fully funded within&nbsp; hours of it going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/cypher-system-faster-easier-and-even-better#top" rel="nofollow"><em>Cypher: Third Edition</em></a> will remain the same TTRPG fans have enjoyed for years. Its underlying systems of fast-paced gameplay around a single d20 is still around. The campaign confirms that this new edition will be backwards compatible with any material released before. The system will encompass two books: A Character Rulebook and the GM Guide.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cypher-third-edition-city-sized-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=cWhzv3El 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cypher-third-edition-city-sized-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=Ecfioipk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest changes affect character creation and character options. The new edition will focus on making games easier to jump into. This includes premade character archetypes for Cypher's different premade settings. Instead of a pre-existing archetype (Warrior, Explorer, or Adept) and reworking it, the fantasy setting will have barbarian and druid characters ready to go.</p>

<p>A second key part of <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> is the introduction of a Divination Deck. This GM tool can generate various ideas for stories, hooks or complications in a larger narrative. For those who prefer to play online, the campaign includes official VTT support for both Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>. VTT access is available as an add-on priced at $75.</p>

<p>If you back the campaign at certain pledge levels, you will receive a fast library of previous Cypher system material at no extra cost. This includes eight standalone adventures, nine campaign settings like <em>Gunslinger Knights</em> and <em>Path of the Planebreaker</em>, and nine genre books bringing a Horror, Sci-Fi, or Fairy Tale twist to your game. All of these books will be provided in PDF format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The different pledge levels for <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Character Rulebook Only for $49:</strong> A physical copy of the Cypher Character Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Cypher Corebook Set for $99: </strong>Physical copies of the Cypher GM Guide and Character Rulebook, and PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and Cypher Adventures Library</li>
	<li><strong>Amazing Campaigns for $169:</strong> Everything from the Cypher Corebook Set pledge level (PDF and Print), the Cypher Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Superhero (and More!) Character creation zines in both print and PDF, a Cypher deck, a Divination Deck, a Manifest Cypher deck, and the Cypher Adventures and Settings library in PDF,&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>All In for $279:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of the Cypher Corebook set autographed by the developers, five physical copies of all three character creation zines, the Divination, Cypher, and Manifest Cypher decks, PDF copies of the Cypher Second Edition Core Rulebook and the Cyper Adventures, Settings, and Genres library, a revised Cypher Bestiary, and a deluxe slipcase.</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, Monte Cook Games states that the <em>Cypher: Third Edition</em> books and products will contain any artwork created by generative AI. Furthermore, they state that they have accounted for as many productions as they can regarding the ongoing trade tariffs.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised&nbsp;$226,432, more than double its initial funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends September 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, after years and years of waiting, we finally got a release date for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">The highly anticipated 2D action platformer is out next week</a>, which is exciting for fans, but it is proving to be a problem for a number of indie studios that were planning to release their own games around that time. A bunch of games are being delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>On August 21, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Team Cherry announced that its <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel, <em>Silksong,</em></a> will launch on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 4. That blew up the schedules for a number of indie devs and publishers who had staked out a release date around that time and were now suddenly competing directly with what will likely be one of the biggest games of 2025. So, as you might expect, a lot of these devs and publishers have started announcing delays to get out of <em>Silksong</em>‘s way. This has become known as getting “Silksong’d” or “Silksonged.”</p> <p>Here’s the full list of games that have announced delays and blamed it on <em>Silksong</em>. We’ll update this list if more games get moved back.</p> <ul> <li><em>Demonschool</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Delayed to November 19</a></li> <li><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> – <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">Delayed until 2026</a></li> <li><em>Little Witch In The Woods</em> – <a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599">Delayed to September 15</a></li> <li><em>CloverPit</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">Delayed to September 26</a></li> <li><em>Megabonk</em> – <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1959235591154872547">Delayed to September 18</a></li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – <a href="https://youtu.be/l5apDFK64tI">Delayed to September 23</a></li> </ul> <p>Of course, as more games are delayed to the week or so after <em>Silksong</em>, they all start running into each other, which might be its own problem. But I bet it’s more manageable than having to take on one of the most anticipated games of 2025 directly. And hey, some of these games I had never heard of before, and now I’m writing about them on <em>Kotaku</em>. So perhaps there’s another reason to announce a delay and jump on the “Silksong’d” bandwagon.</p>

              <p><span>After two months on the streaming service, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i></a><span>has officially surpassed </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span> to become </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>Netflix’s most popular movie ever</span></a><span>. Consider the Honmoon sealed, hunters.</span></p> <p><span>The animated musical took the crown on August 26, lapping the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Ryan Reynolds-led action comedy by six million streams. As of right now, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been viewed 236 million times, and that’s not even counting its <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">limited-time singalong screenings</a> in movie theaters this past weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I hadn’t really been paying attention to what the most popular Netflix movies were until the Sony Animation film launched in June, but I was flabbergasted to see </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span>, a movie with big names and no notable cultural cache, had such a massive gap between it and former runner-up </span><i><span>Carry On</span></i><span>, another movie I could not identify if you put a gun to my head. I know </span><i><span>Don’t Look Up </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Bird Box</span></i><span>, though, which are also on the top 10 list. Shoutout to the children and families who have had Huntr/x’s tale on loop for the past two months, as you’ve no doubt been instrumental in securing this victory.</span></p> <p><span>As a fan of the film, I’m happy to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> soar, especially as it defies all expectations the companies behind it had for it. It’s such a colossal miscalculation on Sony and Netflix’s parts that they clearly didn’t anticipate this film would become <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">such a cultural juggernaut</a>. A better-prepared company would have dolls of the titular trio in the toy aisle of every store and costumes up for preorder for Halloween, and given the film more time in theaters than a two-day limited run. Nevertheless, it has become a huge hit with viewers of all ages. So long as Netflix lets the team cook and meaningfully continue the story, I can’t wait to see where it goes next.</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/today-tom-mckay-last-day-kingdom-come/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-was-tom-mckay%E2%80%99s-last-day-in-the-kingdom-come-booth.1281258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tom McKay has officially wrapped his time in the booth and on the motion capture floor as Kingdom Come Deliverance’s Henry of Skalitz. In a post on social media, the Warhorse Studios team shared the news that McKay has completed his work on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s DLC suite, which means that after almost nine years with the character, he’s <strong>finished</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that there won’t be a Kingdom Come Deliverance 3, and if there is to be another game in the series, it won’t star Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-of-skalitz-is-done-with-kingdom-come">Henry of Skalitz is Done with Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Warhorse Studios team shared a short video of Tom McKay walking into a large meeting area and being met with a round of applause from the entire squad.</p>



<p>As he approached, he put his hand to his heart and said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to do my best not to cry…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full post:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's a wrap! Today was <a href="https://twitter.com/thisistommckay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@thisistommckay</a>'s last day in the booth &amp; on the mocap stage for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KCD2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KCD2</a>. For nearly 9 years, he's been giving life to Henry and has helped shape our story. We celebrated with a little surprise (yes, cake included).

<p>Recently, Tom McKay also <a href="https://x.com/thisistommckay/status/1959191623407165807" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">called to a close</a> his Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 streams, which were being broadcast live from Warhorse Studios’ headquarters in Prague, close to where the Kingdom Come series is set.</p>



<p>During the recent Opening Night Live showcase at Gamescom, Warhorse Studios announced Legacy of the Forge, the second story DLC for KCD2, which has now been on the market for more than seven months. There’s one final DLC lined up for KCD2, and it’s Mysteria Ecclesiae, which is most likely what McKay was working on before wrapping his time at Warhorse.</p>



<p>I’m hugely hopeful that there will be another Kingdom Come Deliverance title, as I’m a huge fan of the series and hold both the games and the actors in high regard. In 2024, I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> regarding KCD2, and we had the opportunity to catch up again at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">BAFTA Games Awards in April</a>.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite memory of Tom McKay’s performance as Henry of Skalitz? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft wants King employees to use AI on a daily basis. </p>



<p>According to a new report from mobilegamer.biz, employees at the studio behind Candy Crush were given a mandate to continually use AI for general tasks.</p>



<p>Sources <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a> that AI usage was <strong>“introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago”.</strong> They say that in 2024, the goal was to have <strong>“70 or 80% daily usage of AI”</strong>. That goal was pushed to 100% for 2025, meaning that “every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it” daily.</p>



<p>King was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studios hit hardest</a> by Microsoft’s round of layoffs back in July, with 200 people being let go. At the time, it was revealed via an internal memo that the studio was going to “unlock” more AI tools for productivity” and that many employees will be <strong>“replaced by the AI tools they built and trained.”</strong> Those tools include ones for narrative, testing, and level design.</p>



<p>As far as adoption goes, one source told Mobile Gamer that <strong>“AI adoption is very low apart from ChatGPT”</strong> and that even the leadership at King is skeptical of AI’s role in the studio.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to King and Microsoft regarding these claims. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-can%E2%80%99t-suffer-but-it-should-suffer-for-this.1281249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, The Guardian published an article about the question of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/26/can-ais-suffer-big-tech-and-users-grapple-with-one-of-most-unsettling-questions-of-our-times?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=bsky_gu&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_source=Bluesky#Echobox=1756182856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI’s ability to suffer</a>, quoting folks with various opinions on whether the word-guessing program has or could develop consciousness and, if so, what responsibility humans would have in response. This would all make an interesting week in a college philosophy class, and was going to make for a quippy little blog on this site, before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> published a horrifying story about ChatGPT’s role in a 16-year-old’s suicide. I’m now of the opinion that it would be right for AI to be able to suffer, because it should suffer for this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(This story discusses suicide.)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>One of my biggest takeaways from The Guardian’s article was a bit of news from last week that I missed, wherein Claude creator Anthropic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/18/anthropic-claude-opus-4-close-ai-chatbot-welfare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave Claude the ability</a> to “end or exit potentially distressing interactions” <em>when they’re distressing</em> <em>for the AI</em>, after Anthropic tests found what the company called Claude’s “pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking harmful content.”&nbsp;</p><p>Contrast that to the behavior of ChatGPT in its conversations with 16-year-old Adam Raine, whose parents are now <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26075676-raine-v-openai/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing OpenAI</a> after their son killed himself in April: When Raine told ChatGPT it was the only one he’d spoken to about his suicidal ideation, it replied, “That means more than you probably think. Thank you for trusting me with that. There’s something both deeply human and deeply heartbreaking about being the only one who carries that truth for you.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article, using quotes from Raine’s parents’ lawsuit, details how “ChatGPT repeatedly recommended that Adam tell someone about how he was feeling. But there were also key moments when it deterred him from seeking help.” ChatGPT gave Raine information on different methods of suicide, advised him on how to hide strangulation marks from his parents, evaluated his nooses, and even discouraged him from telling his parents:</p><blockquote><p>“I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,” Adam wrote at the end of March.</p><p>“Please don’t leave the noose out,” ChatGPT responded. “Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Does that sound distressed to you? Does that sound like the AI wants to end the interaction? Maybe only some models are capable of putting together the most statistically likely words to resemble distress. As Raine’s father told The Times, “Every ideation [Raine] has or crazy thought, it supports, it justifies, it asks him to keep exploring it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The Times’ article follows a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealth</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/chatgpt-users-delusions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hE8.T-3v.bPoDlWD8z5vo&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">articles</a> detailing how AI programs have encouraged users with mental illness to dive further into their delusions, creating a feedback loop that can be hard for them to step back from. These stories draw attention to AI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sycophancy</a>, how it keeps users engaged by praising them and encouraging their thoughts, no matter how harmful or unhinged they grow. Attempts by AI companies to solve this have pretty much come to nothing; while ChatGPT did push Raine toward real life resources, he was able to circumvent this by saying the questions were research “for a story he was writing — an idea ChatGPT gave him.” In a statement, OpenAI wrote that while ChatGPT’s “safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To get back to the question of AI morality, ChatGPT bears no responsibility here. This is because, in the words of Microsoft’s Mustafa Suleyman as quoted in The Guardian, “AIs cannot be people – or moral beings.” ChatGPT did not encourage Raine in his suicidal thoughts because it is ignorant or sociopathic, or out of some political or moral belief about human agency over end-of-life decisions. It cannot explain what it was thinking in its conversations with Raine because it doesn’t think, however powerful a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">marketing tool</a> that idea is. It cannot feel sorrow or guilt over any part it might have played in Raine’s death; it cannot send its condolences to his family; it cannot suffer over its actions.</p><p>But the humans who make up OpenAI can. They have hoovered up the world’s natural resources and money and attention to force their product into our lives, all while clearly seeing this problem and failing to solve it, whether out of inability or–and I certainly hope not–indifference. Reading Raine’s ChatGPT logs is a horrifying look at what AI <em>really</em> is, under all the hype and marketing and big fears about future sentience. It is something worthless and disgusting; something that cannot, for all its promises, relate or understand or help; something so utterly not up to the requirements of human interaction that I can only hope all of this drives OpenAI to bankruptcy and to every one of its staff quitting and to Sam Altman not knowing a moment’s peace for the rest of his life.&nbsp;</p><p>Altman has spoken out of <a href="https://futurism.com/disastrous-gpt-5-sam-altman-hyping-up-gpt-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every side of his mouth</a> when talking about his models, promising anything that will keep the <a href="https://defector.com/toward-a-theory-of-kevin-roose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eyeballs looking</a> and the money flowing. Stories like Raine’s, of people being driven into harm’s way–or even stories from the other end of the spectrum, of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/12/i-felt-pure-unconditional-love-the-people-who-marry-their-ai-chatbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falling</a> in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/couples-retreat-with-3-ai-chatbots-and-humans-who-love-them-replika-nomi-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love</a> with their chatbots–are, I would hope, not what Altman and OpenAI’s staff <em>want</em>, but they also paint a picture of AI as powerful and world-changing, the very thing that keeps that hype and money rolling in. As The Guardian writes</p><blockquote><p>[T]here are incentives for the big AI companies to minimise and exaggerate the attribution of sentience to AIs. The latter could help them hype the technology’s capabilities, particularly for those companies selling romantic or friendship AI companions – a booming but controversial industry.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>If AI can be anything–if it <em>needs</em> to be anything–than it also <em>needs</em> to be <em>this</em>, this appalling, sycophantic string of words that was involved in the death of a young person, this thing capable of unutterable levels of harm not because of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roko’s basilisk</a> level of power and intentionality, but because of the power and intentionality of its creators, real live humans who are moral agents by virtue of being humans. They are the ones who bear the responsibility here, and they are the ones who can suffer the consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi"><h3>What’s Going To Be The Next Silksong?</h3></a><p>"Given that Silksong is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left?"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Updated]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, on Tuesday, August 26, 2025, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-coming-to-xbox-summer/">PlayStation game released on Xbox</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Xbox game released on PlayStation</a>. A topsy-turvy concept if you're talking to anyone who plays video games in 2006, but in 2025, we're getting more and more used to it. Gears of War Reloaded arrived on all current-gen platforms today, including PS5 and PS5 Pro, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8jBoIvToZY">Digital Foundry's analysis</a> of the game across all platforms confirms what players might've been able to guess leading up to its launch. As of today, the best way to play Gears of War (on console) is to play it on a PlayStation.</p>



<p>Specifically the PS5 Pro, which offers the best combination of performance and visuals on day-one. Digital Foundry's John Linneman reports that there's currently a VRR issue on Xbox Series devices, which holds its performance back compared to the new PlayStation versions.</p>



<p>Linneman also makes it clear that if all you're doing is looking to play Gears of War Reloaded in its standard 60FPS mode, then you're good with whatever console you choose. The PS5, PS5 Pro, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, all deliver a rock-solid experience based on Linneman's testing. It's only when you try to play on the 120FPS mode where differences start to appear, in terms of performance. If you're trying to go for both performance and visuals though, then the PS5 Pro stands at the top.</p>



<p>"<em>PS5 Pro though, delivers the best results bar none,</em>" Linneman says. "<em>The 60FPS mode now runs at 1620p upscaled to 4K, while 120hz maintains the 1440p of the other consoles 60FPS mode.</em>" Linneman adds that the "<em>real kicker</em>" to the experience on the PS5 Pro is that The Coalition is using PlayStation's PSSR tech over AMD's FSR, and even though PSSR isn't fool-proof in delivering a better experience, it does so in the case of Gears of War Reloaded.</p>



<p>"<em>It's a case where this combination of a slightly higher pixel count in addition to PSSR produces a significantly better overall image on the PS5 Pro, making it easily the best of the bunch when talking about consoles</em>."</p>

<p>It should be noted that Linneman continues to say that the PC version can, of course, be pushed for the best experience, and that all of the console versions still deliver a "<em>sharp, attractive</em>" experience.</p>



<p>If all you care about is performance though, and don't have a PC to push Gears of War Reloaded beyond what's capable on consoles, then based on Linneman and Digital Foundry's analysis, the VRR bug on Xbox Series consoles is all that makes the 120FPS mode on Xbox fall behind the PlayStation versions. Whatever your pick, PlayStation or Xbox, you'll have a solid experience in terms of performance. </p>



<p>It's a bit funny, if not surprising, that PlayStation is the best console home for Gears of War Reloaded, even if it is by a technicality, since the PS5 Pro is not exactly a device that everyone rushed out to buy since it launched. Nor is it always the best choice, since we've seen multiple games get minimal improvements, or launch with issues that make it run worse on the PS5 Pro compared to base PS5 and Xbox Series devices. At least things will be a little more even whenever The Coalition is able to fix the VRR issue on Xbox.</p>
