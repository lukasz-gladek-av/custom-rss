		<p>Sony has confirmed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games coming along in October 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, psychological anime and some oiled up wrestling.</p>
<p>Let’s see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus October 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which happens to be 1st October.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!</strong></li>
<li><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The headline act here really is Dead Space, the 2023 remake of the PS3 and 360 horror classic. “EA Motive have done incredible work with the Dead Space remake to bring a horror classic up to date,” Nick wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/dead-space-remake-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/">Dead Space review</a>, “injecting true horror back into the genre alongside considered changes and expansions to the original story. It’s hands down one of the best remakes ever made, and it’s like playing Dead Space for the first time all over again. Welcome back, Isaac.”</p>


<p>Then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/12/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-side-stories-pc-switch-xbox-ps4-ps5/">the expanded psychological horror of Doki Doki Literature Club</a>. What initially seems to be a romancing visual novel ends up unfolding into something very, very different. Can you crack the code and reach the perfect ending?</p>
<p>And finally, we have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/22/wwe-2k24-launches-march-8th-classic-match-types-confirmed/">WWE 2K24</a>, which looks to celebrate 40 years of WrestleMania with a cast of superstars from across the decades, including&nbsp;“Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Undertaker and Andre the Giant, alongside more contemporary stars “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes, John Cena, Rhea Ripley and Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab September’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 1st October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quidditch Champions</strong></li>
<li><strong>MLB The Show 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares II</strong></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date, with the latest mainline installment in the long-running monster-slaying RPG series due to launch early next year.</p>
<p>During yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation, Capcom revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date is February 28th. Don't worry, though; it's also coming to other platforms on that date, not just PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The event also brought a reveal for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' flagship monster, which is a new winged creature known as Arkveld. Capcom says it "hails from a long-extinct species with an ecology shrouded in mystery".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-arkveld.jpg?itok=U_Dr5sWt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-arkveld.jpg?itok=JU2_Gxu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has its flagship monster, so prepare for a fierce battle.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer shown off during yesterday's PlayStation event also featured a number of other reveals for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, including a look at the game's second major area, the Scarlet Forest.</p>
<p>We also got to see new monsters like the Leviathan-type Uth Duna and the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, which inhabits the Windward Plains. Of course, the game will include far more monsters than just these three, but these are some of the new creatures you'll be battling.</p>
<p>You can check out the new promotional trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good idea of what you can expect from the finished game in terms of aesthetics and style, and there's a splash of gameplay in there too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">latest game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">hugely successful titles</a> like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>
<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to be made with current-gen consoles specifically in mind, <i>Wilds&nbsp;</i>sees you journeying into the Forbidden Lands in order to investigate tales of a "mysterious monster" that attacked a village.</p>
<p>As with all&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>games, you'll have to adjust your tactics for each monster encounter, taking into account their weaknesses and figuring out what approach works best.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on February 28th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

		<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures, the blocky retelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, is launching on 14th November, Sony has announced. The quirky reimagining is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, PC and Nintendo Switch… but obviously not Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Horizon Adventures - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNAdje1kPxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed in partnership between Guerrilla and Studio Gobo, it’s one of the first times I can think of a big budget game being given the Lego treatment, similar to TT Games’ enduring film adaptations.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a cute and quirky take on the thoroughly serious sci fi adventure that Aloy went on in 2017. An ancient evil is still seeking to destroy the world, and you’ll have to journey through the lush meadows, forests, and over the mountains of Earth to save it from a man named Helis and the evil that they follow.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures will be playable with both couch co-op and in online play.</p>

<p>The team has done a fantastic job of realising the whole world out of Lego-style bricks and pieces, when many games would have combined more traditional 3D game geometry with isolated block sections and structures.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of space for some extra shenanigans, and the pre-order trailer showed how the game is being sprinkled with PlayStation easter eggs and in jokes. You’ll be able to customise your characters as well as your home, as well.</p>
<p>This will make the game and universe much more suitable for younger players, but just in case you’re feeling it’s a little bit immature, Lego Horizon Adventures is coming out just a couple weeks after<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/"> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. This remaster looks to bring the original game up to the standards of Horizon Forbidden West, making use of the PS5 and PS5 Pro to push a bunch of new graphical effects. There’s also around 10 hours of freshly captured conversation mocap, to try and bring more life to the dialogue in the game – one of my biggest criticisms from its original launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review.991485/</guid>

			<p>There’s plenty of tropes that have persisted through the 35-year history of The Legend of Zelda, the developers over the decades painting with the same motifs of Triforces, a battle through the ages with Ganon and Ganondorf, and a young boy in a green tunic for the hero. It’s a testament to the series creators that they’ve still been able to tell such compelling tales while using the same brush and colour palette. But it’s also time for a change. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> it’s time for Zelda to be the hero of her own story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01onjjAUnOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now it’s time for Zelda to save the land of Hyrule from a great peril, as it’s Link and not Zelda that’s sucked into mysterious purple rifts that are spreading across the land. And that simple-sounding change of protagonist brings with it massive changes for how this game actually works. Nintendo and developer Grezzo could have simply given Zelda a sword and shield and sent her out in a green dress, but instead they’ve cooked up wholly new and refreshing gameplay ideas for her to journey with.</p>


<p>Presented with a Triwand by the helpful rift-healing sprite Tri, Zelda becomes more of a trickster wizard than a frontline brawler. The Triwand enables her to copy all manner of objects through that she find through the world and then summon them as ‘echoes’ to help her get around. Want to get up onto a ledge? Well, laying small tables, crates and beds can create an impromptu staircase to hop up. Need something to throw at the traditional Zelda game enemies? Summon a rock, pick it up and toss it at them! You’re limited only by the amount of energy pips that Tri has, and the temporary cost that each echo has.</p>


<p>There’s other abilities lent to Zelda by Tri more directly, namely being able to Bind to objects and move them around with Zelda, no matter how big they are, or to have Zelda lock to and move with them, such as with a moving platform. You can switch back and forth while linked, which brings huge possibilities together for the environmental puzzling. Attach to a wall-climbing spider, and you’ll get up and over that wall, no problem!</p>
<p>Once enemies are defeated for the first time, their form can also be absorbed into the Triwand and summoned forth at will, letting you bring forth echoes to fight for and defend you. It creates these quirky little battles where you either try to spam creatures at enemies, or actually apply a little bit of puzzle logic to the situation before you. Octorocks are pretty effective on water, as they sink and hop up to shoot at a target, but if it’s a flying enemy, maybe a steadily respawning swarm of Keese would do the trick instead? Thick grass? It’s time to set everything on fire with a Zol. Or you’d better set a Darknut against shrieking zombies, as they struggle to do any damage to its armour.</p>

<p>It’s often a bit messy, especially when there’s multiple enemy types, or battles are drawn out if you head to a more difficult spot early in the game, and Zelda’s mainly got to run away, avoid focus and the put her most powerful ability to use at exactly the right time: the Swordfighter form.</p>
<p>This effectively turns her into a blue spectral Link, sword in hand, able to wail upon enemies and deal a lot of more focused damage in short order. However, this drains the energy meter, which limits the amount of time this is available for. Inevitably, you save it for more special occasions, such as the damage phase of a boss battle after you’ve knocked it out through evasion and echo damage – handily these also tend to see a sprinkling of energy appear to top Zelda’s energy up.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe this is all just my playstyle, because it feels like there’s so much creativity and more options available to you, and you can express yourself a little more than you might initially expect. In combat, you can spam those echoes, or you could summon one and then Bind to hold it in front of you, perhaps. My go-to for bridging gaps and getting higher was simply to layer bed upon bed in gravity-defying fashion. Maybe you’d rather use a trampoline on occasion, or attach to a bird and let them take you places. Bed stairs are pretty handy though, because you can have a nap and regain health…</p>

<p>The main problem with this summoning system is that the way you access all the echoes you collect is with a single line horizontal list. You can filter it to be of the most recent summons, most used, most recently caught, and by category, but it’s always just a single endless list that you’re picking from, and that’s inherently unwieldy once you’ve got more than ten. You can access a grid-based inventory view in your notebook, but it’s still not a perfect system. It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut of just constantly reusing the same echoes because of this – see my go-to stairs of beds.</p>
<p>It’s also pretty easy to be all fingers and thumbs when trying to do this in the heat of the moment. The echo selector does pause time – you should use the left bumper instead of the D-pad, always – but then targeting an echo under pressure is a bit tricky, and that’s before trying to use Tri’s ability to grab things. Some of the chaotic feel of combat simply comes from you not being directly involved, with only limited ability to direct echoes and them being slow to wind up their attacks, and the controls fundamentally being different to a traditional Zelda game.</p>

<p>There’s also a good few side-scrolling sections and light puzzle platforming, most commonly within the rifts and the Still World. Side-scrolling puts a different spin on how you use your abilities and echoes, a little sprinkling of something a bit different alongside the top-down adventure. There’s also other more incidental ideas, with costumes, smoothie blending, weapon upgrading, and charms to wear.</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s quite a light-feeling adventure, and a big part of that is thanks to the art style. Grezzo has continued on from their work on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, and it absolutely works for this game as well, the chunky character designs and world, the tilt shift-ish effect, and more generally the tone of the story that’s being told – some of the main quest stories feel particularly child friendly.</p>

<p>As gorgeous as this art style is, Echoes of Wisdom also has echoes of one of the nagging problems of the last time it was used. The Link’s Awakening remake had frame rate stutters aplenty, and that hasn’t been dispelled for this new game. It doesn’t really get in the way of the gameplay, given the general tone and pacing of this adventure, but it’s a shame to feel the frame rate juddering so often.</p>

					<p>“Why are the games called ‘The Legend of Zelda’ when you always play as Link?” is an inescapable question asked by pretty much everybody who encounters Nintendo’s beloved series, and yet, the company has never really provided a satisfactory answer beyond, “Uh, just because.” Well, this four-decade-long confusing state of affairs is being resolved (for now) as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> finally gives the Princess herself a starring role. This also marks the first original 2D Zelda title since 2013’s A Link Between Worlds, so a lot of longstanding fan requests are being satisfied at once here.</p>
<p>Is The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom another properly-epic entry in the franchise? Or does the game take some unwise steps? Time to shine the spotlight on Zelda’s big debut…</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom begins on a familiar note, as Link, controlled by the player for a few brief minutes, battles Ganon in order to save Princess Zelda. Ah, but upon taking down the big pig, a mysterious rift opens open, drawing Link in. Just before our green-clad hero disappears into the depths, he manages to free Zelda from her crystalline prison with a well-placed arrow and she escapes with an ever-growing rift on her heels. From this point on, the player takes on the role of Zelda, and it becomes clear this version of Hyrule isn’t in great shape. The land is beset by numerous rifts, which have a habit of sucking in innocent citizens and producing evil copies in their place. This happens to Zelda’s dad the King, whose doppelganger promptly sends her to the dungeon.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Zelda’s adventure doesn’t end there, as she soon meets Tri, a little energy sprite eager to help with her quest, and gets her hands on the Tri Rod, a powerful wand that allows her to create “echoes” of various objects and enemies. It seems Tri’s spherical friends have long been tasked containing Hyrule’s rifts, which connect to a dark alternate dimension known as the Still World, but somebody or something has been trapping them, allowing the rifts to spread unchecked. Armed with the Tri Rod and Tri’s ability to enter the Still World at key locations, it’s up to Zelda to clean up the rifts, find Link and the King, and figure out what’s behind all this turmoil.</p>
<p>It’s certainly great to see Zelda step out of her usual supporting role in Echoes of Wisdom, but if you’re expecting a plot that feels markedly different from what this series has served up in the past, you may be disappointed. The game doesn’t really do much with Zelda as a character, nor does it do a lot to develop her relationship with Link. While Nintendo does throw out a bit of a mid-game twist, the overall plot is short of big shocks or emotional stakes and its big finale feels like a minor letdown from a storytelling standpoint. Of course, most Zelda stories are relatively simple, but the best ones still manage to deliver occasional affecting, memorable moments. Echoes of Wisdom’s story, by comparison, just kind of washes over you, leaving little behind.</p>

<p>All that said, while Echoes of Wisdom’s story doesn’t quite captivate, it’s version of Hyrule does. 2D Zelda worlds have often felt a bit lonely, but Echoes of Wisdom brings a Breath-of-the-Wild-like vibrancy to its Hyrule. This take on Hyrule includes around half a dozen towns, each bustling with unique and charming NPCs worth getting to know. The quirky side of Zelda is on full display here, as you can indulge in pastimes like dressing up like a cat to talk to Hyrule’s feline population, finding stamps for a distinctly Tingle-like collector, and more. This is all brought to life via the same charming toy-like presentation as the 2019 Link’s Awakening remake, albeit with a new level of detail and variety. Thankfully, while you’ll still encounter some stutters and stumbles, Echoes of Wisdom also runs better than the Link’s Awakening remake. So, even if EoW’s story didn’t always grab me, I was eager to get back to the game’s Hyrule and its many colorful residents even after rolling credits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom’s Hyrule is larger and more open than past 2D entries in the series (it’s at least twice as large as A Link to the Past’s map), but make no mistake, those looking for a bit more structure after back-to-back “open-air” Zeldas will be pleased. While there are certain points in Echoes of Wisdom where you can choose the order in which you tackle a handful of regions and their dungeons, the rifts covering Hyrule allow the game’s developers to lock off parts of the map and lead you through a fairly specific campaign. While I don’t deny that clever fans may eventually discover something, I don’t think there’s a way to jump directly to the end of the game or skip any key steps along the way. That may irk some, but, personally, I’ve increasingly begun to feel the “finish the game whenever you want” gimmick of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a> hurt those games’ campaigns more than it helped.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s campaign follows a set formula – venture to a new region, meet the people that live there, then complete two or three smaller tasks in order to access the entry spot to that region’s large rift, which contains its dungeon. The most common of the lesser tasks you have to complete is clearing out small rifts, which almost feel like platformer stages (EoW gives you a full-on jump button). These small rifts task players with navigating floating debris in order to free several of Tri’s friends (usually four of five bunches of them) which does bring to mind the “collect X number of things” approach of BotW and TotK’s dungeons in a way that may illicit groans from a segment of the Zelda fanbase. That said, small rifts are generally brief (most don’t take more than 20 minutes) and don’t wear on you.</p>
<p>In addition to the small rifts, other challenges are mixed in – stealth sections, puzzle-filled caves, ect. Once you’ve completed your three-or-so lesser objectives, it’s time to enter the large rift, all of which contain a dungeon. And yes, for those concerned, these are real, full-on dungeons with small keys, a boss key, map, and the whole deal. In fact, these dungeons feel notably old-school, like a modernization of the labyrinths you may have once tromped through in A Link to the Past or Link’s Awakening. Needless to say, the “Bring back real dungeons!” lobby should be pleased by what Echoes of Wisdom serves up (a hearty seven full dungeons and some other dungeon-like experiences beyond that).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Zelda may be new to this adventuring thing, but she has no shortage of tools for exploring Hyrule, the Still World, and its dangerous dungeons. Of course, Echoes of Wisdom’s spotlight tool is the Tri Rod, which allows Zelda to summon echoes of mundane objects tables and beds, more fantastical things like floating cubes of water and flying floor tiles, and basically ever non-boss enemy you encounter in the game. Your summoned monsters can be siced on other baddies or, in some cases, used for other purposes (you can glide while clutching a Keese and spiders create climbable threads, for example). Tri can also “bind” to things you create, and a few other objects, allowing you to move them around at a distance much like Ultrahand Grab function from TotK, adding another layer to EoW’s puzzle-solving toolbox.</p>
<p>While I haven’t carefully counted them all, I’ve probably collected nearly 100 echoes, and while it’s cool to have so many options at your disposal, sifting through them all can be a minor annoyance. The game does give you limited options for sorting your echoes — by last one used, most used, the last acquired, and so on — but there are going to be times where you're stuck just scrolling through your increasingly-long list for the thing you need. That said, the game does pause when you're navigating your list and in most areas and dungeons you can get by with a half-dozen-or-so key echoes of your choice.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Nintendo has heavily hyped the freedom the echo system give players, but in my experience, Echoes of Wisdom’s puzzles are a bit less open-ended than something like Tears of the Kingdom. Typically, there is a set solution to a puzzle — move a rock that’s behind a gate onto a switch, for instance — with the player having some freedom about what<em> specific</em> combination of objects and enemies they want to use to proceed. It’s rare that you’re able to fully short-circuit or skip a puzzle as you can in BotW or TotK, or at least I wasn’t able to. Again, I don’t discount that particularly clever fans will figure out things I didn’t, but generally speaking, EOW feels like it provides a healthy measure of freedom within the confines of a more traditional Zelda structure, which actually felt like a nice balance to me. I realize some may miss the giddy “do whatever, all the time” ethos of the open-air Zeldas, but the series’ classic approach to puzzle and world design is something many fans, myself included, find satisfying in its own right. There’s room for both approaches here in 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s approach to puzzle and dungeon design, I wasn’t always captivated by its combat. As mentioned, players can summon any number of different monsters and direct them to attack other enemies using a basic targeting system. This works, but only <em>just</em>, as your AI allies are pretty stupid, attacking slowly and often getting stuck on or behind objects. They'll eventually get the job done, and you can pitch in by tossing rocks and other objects at baddies, but the process feels too drawn out, particularly early on when you only have low-level monsters at your command.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t force you to rely entirely on monster echoes to do your fighting. Relatively early on, you'll gain the ability to transform into Swordfighter Form, which allows you to tackle enemies head-on with a sword, and later, a bow and bombs. Unfortunately, you can only get to wield a sword for a fairly limited time, with an energy bar quickly dwindling while you’re in the form. Limiting the use of Swordfighter Form is a somewhat questionable decision to begin with, but it can be downright frustrating at times given the limited amount of energy the game gives you. Floating bits of energy are found in the Still World and are dropped by some enemies, but it’s surprisingly hard to come by, even at times when a lot of energy is required like during boss battles.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> keep your energy bar topped up by consuming various “smoothies,” which you can create via a simple crafting system. This is a cute idea, but you can’t mix up a smoothie just anywhere, as they’re only produced by a handful of vendors scattered around Hyrule. This resulted in me frequently having to back out of dungeons just before the final boss so I could go back to a town and craft additional smoothies for the energy I’d need. A fairly generous checkpoint system makes this not <em>too </em>much of a trial, but this whole system feels like it could have been smoothed out a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, before you get too worried, I’m not saying combat in Echoes of Wisdom is bad. You will likely get the hang of it eventually, Swordfighter Form can be leveled up to give you a longer energy bar and stronger weapons, and you can even find gear that makes energy easier to come by. By the end of the game, I was quite comfortable with combat, but I can't help but feel like the developers overthought things slightly. Simply giving Zelda the ability to use traditional weapons <em>and</em> summon echoes all the time might have been better. As is, Echoes of Wisdom is a 2D Zelda, which have typically thrived on their simplicity and playability, that can feel a bit fussy at times.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately though, any fussiness doesn’t obscure what Echoes of Wisdom is at its core -- a really good, modern take on the traditional Zelda format, with excellent old-school dungeons and an enticing world. And really, it’s some of the game’s less-flashy new features I enjoyed the most. The more responsive-feeling controls and platforming, the addition of a wide array of engaging sidequests, the ability to ride a dang horse in a 2D Zelda! This is the old-school Zelda you love, polished up to meet modern expectations.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdoms brings a lot of different things to the table, and in large quantities. The game is easily the franchise’s biggest 2D entry to date, offering up a story that took me 25 hours to complete and enough side content to keep you playing a dozen or more hours beyond that. Zelda’s first adventure as a headliner is no mere morsel, it’s royal banquette that ought to leave most fans feeling satisfied for some time.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, launching September 26th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct">is Princess Zelda’s first standalone adventure</a>. Her debut solo outing does an excellent job of establishing Zelda as a protagonist that’s unique and separate from that green guy. But the game’s sparse environments, formulaic dungeons, and simplistic platforming and puzzles ultimately swallow her up, making Zelda feel underutilized, even in her own game.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, giant rifts have opened up all over Hyrule, trapping everything and everyone in a void of stillness while spitting out evil versions of the people the rifts have consumed. With the help of an adorable creature named Tri, Zelda must use the copying power of the Tri Rod to rescue her allies, defeat the evil clones, and stop the rifts from swallowing Hyrule whole.</p><div><figcaption><em>Zelda uses her Tri Rod to summon copies of objects called “echoes.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>Before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, every opportunity we’ve had to play as Zelda has been in spinoffs, with gameplay designed to fit whatever alternate universe she’s in rather than her own personality. She’s a typical sword and board protagonist in her two Philips CD-i games. She busts out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6251849/hyrule-warriors">elegant fencing in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em></a> and uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel">the myriad powers of the Sheikah Slate to fight in <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>. And of course, she’s got a pair of lethal hands rated E for Everyone in<em> Super Smash Bros</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But what makes the most sense for Zelda, in her original context as the Princess of Hyrule, when Link’s not around and there are dungeons to delve into and monsters to defeat?</p><p>Using her wits.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, Zelda must figure out how to use echoes, or copies, of objects from throughout Hyrule to save the day. If there’s a wide gap to cross, Zelda can use the Tri Rod to build a bridge out of beds. When a pig-like Moblin is in her way, she can summon a bigger, meaner Moblin echo to fight it. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is smart in that it allows Zelda to establish her own identity as a hero that feels authentic to her as a character. She doesn’t need brute force and utility belts worth of specialized tools, just her brain and fire zol or two. She’s distinct from Link but is as formidable a force as he is — scarier even. After all, who should Ganon worry about more? The guy who can kill him with a sword or the girl who can kill him with literally <em>anything</em>?</p><p>In the game’s first handful of hours, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on">using echoes to solve puzzles and fight monsters was seriously fun</a>, reminding me of the first hours of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> The vastness of Hyrule lay sprawled out before me filled with things to discover, and it was up to me to figure out how. Puzzles and platforming sequences have multiple solutions and routes depending on which echoes you’ve learned. Instead of stacking beds to cross a gap, I can use a flying tile. Or I could use Tri’s “reverse bind” ability to tether Zelda’s movement to another moving object.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The breadth of Hyrule is vast but feels very empty.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But neither the possibilities nor the world were as vast as I initially thought. After a while, I realized there wasn’t much to do outside of the main quest. There were smaller rifts to clean up, which were minor dungeons all with the same objective: find three to five of Tri’s friends hidden behind monsters or complete simple platforming puzzles. Or there were a handful of side quests to complete, which were usually one-and-done objectives that involved either finding a thing or killing a thing. So many parts of Hyrule were just empty, populated only by the occasional monster or treasure chest. Eventually, I didn’t bother trying to explore anymore, choosing instead to fast-travel from place to place.</p><div><p>In Echoes of Wisdom there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far</p></div><p>Though <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> isn’t as large or as long as <em>Breath of the Wild </em>or T<em>ears of the Kingdom</em>, all three games operate on the basic premise of, “Here’s an open world and a bunch of abilities, figure it out.” What made <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and T<em>ears of the Kingdom </em>so fun was that both games presented so many different kinds of puzzle and platforming challenges that required out-of-the-box thinking to solve. Whereas in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far. And in nearly every instance, those challenges can be solved with the same handful of echoes. I had so many of them, like a gnarly rolling log of spikes, that I never got the chance to use. The game never gave me a reason to.</p><p><small>You solve 90 percent of the game’s platforming challenges with beds and trampolines.</small></p><p>Combat was far better at incentivizing creativity than platforming. Each enemy has different movement and attack patterns, requiring the careful selection of the right monster or item to counter it. The snake-like rope monsters are fast, low to the ground, and hard to see when camouflaged in their grassy habitat, making them impossible to hit with melee attacking monsters. After I wasted too much time hoping my bird echo would pluck it off the ground, I discovered a much simpler solution: light everything on fire with a torch. And when I couldn’t find the right monster for the job, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">Zelda can use Link’s sword, arrows, or bombs for a limited amount of time</a>.</p><p>I think that the singular ability to use Link’s sword gets at the heart of what’s ultimately disappointing about<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em>: all of Zelda’s wits don’t really amount to much. Sure I had dozens of echoes at my disposal, but halfway through the game, they only got in my way as I scrolled past them to get to the same five echoes I knew would get the job done. Combat was better, but whenever I wanted, I could thwart a difficult foe by simply stabbing it to death. That’s not to say <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> wasn’t fun. I wouldn’t have taken the time to clear every optional dungeon or most of the side quests if I hadn’t been enjoying myself.</p><p>But after 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and strength.</p><p><small><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> launches on Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Recent discoveries made with an in-depth look at the Switch 18.0.0 firmware seem to suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed going to be backward compatible with its predecessor, as rumored in the past few months.</p>
<p>As detailed by<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1292389"> Famiiboards user Pokemaniac</a>, the Switch 18.0.0 firmware update added support for a new type of mount point, a way to expose files to games, classified as "compat". This new type of mount point could be used for higher quality assets for the Nintendo Switch 2, shader caches, making certain files available contextually as part of a unified file system for cross-gen games, protecting critical files in the next-gen consoles from piracy and emulation, or potentially injecting compatibility shims as part of the backward compatibility system.</p>
<p>The more rumors circulate on the Nintendo Switch 2 console, the more the wait for the system becomes difficult to bear for the many fans eagerly awaiting its release. Very little is currently know for certain about the system other than the fact that it has been in the works for a while. Every other information has come from leaks and rumors, such as the fact that AMD lost the bid to design the system due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/"> handheld mode performance and power consumption concerns</a> and that the new NVIDIA chip that powers the system will provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction support, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">higher resolution than the Steam Deck.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7:</strong> PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution on PS5 Pro is also effective on 4K sources, allowing for even more detail and higher image quality than ever before. The game now supports ray tracing during races, not only for car surfaces to show full reflections of other cars but also for a car to reflect its own parts. Furthermore, Gran Turismo 7 will feature experimental support for 8K/60fps output.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered:</strong> In Horizon Forbidden West, you can now enjoy a visual quality that matches or surpasses the Quality mode on the regular PlayStation 5, but at 60 FPS (twice the framerate). Also, there are many improvements to the Decima engine that are now made possible because of the rendering power of PS5 Pro. You’ll see improvement in shadows, depth-of-field, skin and hair shaders, clouds, god rays, and more. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered also comes with native support for PlayStation 5 Pro. This includes a range of graphical features that have been improved to use the power of the PS5 Pro while delivering ultra-high fidelity at blazing-fast framerates.</em></p>

This mode maintains the 60 FPS target, offering an ideal balance of framerate and resolution. Performance and Fidelity rendering modes are still available on PS5 Pro, providing an even smoother experience than players would see on an original PS5 and a higher framerate if your display supports it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart:</strong> Players of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will find a new default Performance Pro mode, combining the 4K resolution and ray tracing features of Fidelity mode with the 60 FPS of Performance mode.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:</strong> With the increased performance capabilities of the PS5 Pro, the quality of the Performance and Fidelity visual modes has improved without compromising player experience. Players will be able to experience crisper, higher-resolution graphics, leveraging PSSR on all visual modes. The additional GPU performance power allowed an overhaul of the Fidelity Ray tracing visual mode to present the game in a new light. Players will notice new reflections and ray-traced shadows in all environments.<a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hogwarts-Legacy-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2, Resident Evil Village, and Resident Evil 4:</strong> Dragon’s Dogma 2 will benefit from the power of the PS5 Pro, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), and new ray tracing technology, allowing improved framerates. For Resident Evil Village, CAPCOM added a 120 FPS gameplay option when running the game on the new console. For Resident Evil 4, CAPCOM only confirmed higher framerates.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</strong> The game’s Fidelity and Performance modes will see improvements on the new console, including improved resolution in 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. Additionally, there will be various improved visual settings across 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. BioWare also noted that PSSR allows for 'upgraded image quality'. Lastly, the PS5 Pro version of the game includes ray traced ambient occlusion on the 60FPS performance modes, which is only available in the 30FPS mode on the base PlayStation 5.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: </strong>The Quality Mode offers the game's highest-ever console resolution at 2160p. At the same time, Performance Mode still delivers 60 FPS, but now with higher resolution, ray traced reflections, and ray traced ambient occlusion. Finally, the new PSSR upscaling ensures a sharper visual experience in both modes.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alan Wake 2:</strong> Ray tracing has been added to the Quality mode. Remedy also used the additional power of PS5 Pro to improve the visuals and effects in the 60 FPS Performance mode, improving the rendering resolution from the PS5's 1440p to 4K.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth:</strong> The new Enhanced Mode developed especially for PS5 Pro runs at a frame rate of 60 FPS and supports PSSR to achieve a resolution on par with that of Graphics Mode.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows:</strong> The game will take advantage of the PS5 Pro to deliver enhanced ray-traced global illumination technology. Thanks to PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) and combined with the more powerful GPU, players will see improved rendering systems.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Stellar Blade:</strong> With the PlayStation 5 Pro, players will be able to enjoy the game in 4K resolution at 50fps or higher, and you’ll notice an improvement in grain and detail in the game in PSSR upscale mode. Plus, the HFR (high framerate) option is supported, allowing you to enjoy a smooth gaming experience at 80 fps (120hz display support required).</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gran-Turismo-7-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>The First Descendant:</strong> NEXON is leveraging PS5 Pro’s superior GPU performance and enhanced ray tracing architecture to achieve more lifelike and natural lighting and shadow effects compared to the standard PS5. Additionally, by utilizing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the game will run at a higher resolution and with better image quality. The developers are also currently working on enabling FSR 3.1 Frame Generation to provide improved framerates.</em></p>

            <p>There is an absolute carkfest of a headline to be written here involving the words "head" "not" "enough" and "giving", but I am a journalist of grace and discretion, and will resist. Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in the aftermath of August's beta. Specifically, they're tweaking the damage from bullets to the cranium, while trying to ensure that bullets to the cranium don't "significantly affect the consistency of time to kill".</p><!--more-->
<p>"A common piece of feedback we saw was that low headshot damage reduced the impact of skillful play and made it difficult to challenge certain power positions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1938090/view/4708039771691823303?l=english">comments the Steam post in question</a>. "We agree with these points and are working on adjustments to many weapons to reward players who land multiple headshots during an engagement. That said, we do not want hit location multipliers to significantly affect the consistency of time to kill in Black Ops 6, so we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of headshots during launch and beyond."</p>
<p>I know little and wish to know little about the real-life efficacy of headshots. I know slightly more about the concept of time-to-kill in shooters. It's a deceptively simple-sounding metric that can transform your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> entirely. Stretch out the seconds a player can last under fire and you've got a relatively sedate, borderline-RPG experience, in which duellists have leisure to dart and circle and get to know each other between bursts. Shrink them back down, and (if you're a terrible player, like me), you've got an extremely fast Game-Over montage, with the occasional hint of a pointed rifle in the scarlet haze of your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>COD has historically been a low TTK shooter, and it doesn't feel like you're all that spongier in Black Ops 6, but then again, I rarely land a headshot. I wish Treyarch and Raven Software the best of luck cooking the books, because it's the kind of thing the fans have extensive, unpunctuated opinions about.</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive round-up of other stuff they're pruning and polishing, siphoned from that Steam post:</p>
<p>- "Bullet Penetration is another system that we will be improving for launch. In general players should notice fewer extreme cases of bullets doing far too much damage through certain surfaces (AKA Wall Bang), while also not penetrating as expected through others (e.g., those pesky snipers behind the radar dish on Scud)." </p>
<p>- "We're also evaluating some changes to cover placement across multiple maps, including some of our Beta maps, which we'll be able to share more details on closer to launch."</p>
<p>- "Players may have noticed improvements to spawn logic throughout Weekend 2 of the Beta, and as new content comes into the game and we generate even more spawn data, we're always assessing our spawn system and will continue to make necessary updates to it through launch and beyond."</p>
<p>- "Over the course of the Beta, we identified several areas that were impacting in-game performance. Some areas where we've made progress on performance include resolving general script errors, addressing issues related to our in-game user interface as well as overall improvements and fixes to our asset streaming. A smooth game performance is paramount to the player experience, and we've been able to chase down sources of in-game "hitching" and deploy major fixes since the close of the Beta."</p>
<p>- "We identified several areas for improvement to our 3rd-Person animation fidelity across slide, dive, jump and supine prone. Our goal is that what you see in 1st Person is representative of what others see in 3rd Person in order to maintain immersion and predictability."</p>
<p>They're also trying to pin down a "nice middle ground" for "the time before you could enter supine during a slide", while reducing the minimum time before you can slide while sprinting. This latter twist is designed to reduce the odds of a "dead slide", wherein you accidentally crouch instead of sliding. Truly, performing a dead slide is an abysmal faux pas of Austenian dimensions, much like referencing sex acts in headlines or singing "just the two of us" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">when you're a meatshield</a>.</p>
<p>Circle-strafing back to the angst over headshots - what's your preferred blend of TTK and hit location multiplier? I always think it's quite jolly when players scurry about with arrows and whatnot sticking out of their ears. Blops 6 is out 25th October. In other news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developer-union-have-accused-activision-blizzard-and-microsoft-of-bad-faith-bargaining">unionised workers at Raven Software are pursuing a complaint against Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, alleging "bad faith bargaining".</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-museum-is-light-on-history-big-on-fun.991452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A good open-world game often has that emotional moment when the world opens up for the very first time. Take peering out at Hyrule from the grand plateau after leaving the first cave in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. And while  the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto is a comparatively  small sandbox to Breath of the Wild’s huge open world, reaching the exhibition floor after climbing the escalator for the first time feels just as special. Greeted with familiar music and sound effects, you’re instantly invited  to a Nintendo fan’s paradise that extends 360 degrees. </p><p>As you enter the exhibition floor, jumbo-sized versions of different Nintendo controllers and consoles can be seen hanging from the ceiling, with all the hardware and software that Nintendo has produced over the years displayed beneath them. Like Breath of the Wild’s open world,  no correct order to the exhibits, so you are free to roam in any direction  you please. And despite the sheer number of exhibits, I never felt overwhelmed or lost. It almost felt as if Nintendo was using its expertise in level design to curate the museum.</p><p>However, despite the abundance of Nintendo products on display there are very few items like development materials, original drawings, or prototypes that you can’t find anywhere else, which was disappointing. And for a museum, the amount of explanation and context that Nintendo gives to its displays is also surprisingly limited. As a longtime Nintendo fan, I found myself hoping for more than just final products, and I would have liked some deeper context added to the exhibits. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>Instead of focusing on its past, Nintendo seems to following the same ethos as it does for its games: make an experience thatanyone can pick up and play, with minimal tutorial explanations. The Nintendo Museum lets you experience the company’s 135 year history with that same philosophy in mind.</p><p>From the NES to the Nintendo Switch, and GameBoy to 3DS, all the game consoles that Nintendo has produced are on display together with their own games as well as some of the major third-party titles. There are even some of those nostalgic peripherals. Gameplay for the games  on display can be seen on screens as well.</p><p>A little bit of context is added to each display, showing how sales were divided per territory for each console, what series started on each hardware, and what kind of new challenges and technology were introduced.</p><p>Almost all of the software has both a Japanese, North American and European package at display. Just by walking around, it becomes apparent how much more global the industry has become. While games often had different titles and package art depending on the region during the NES days, releases on the Nintendo Switch pretty much all look the same for each territory.</p><p>If you’re visiting the museum from overseas, seeing the Japanese package art for your favorite games while still being able to take a nostalgic glimpse at the art you grew up with creates a nice balance. Old TV commercials and video game magazines from multiple regions also take visitors back to their childhood. It happened to me a few times when I suddenly saw an image that I didn’t even know I was nostalgic for.</p><p>It is true that almost all of what you can see on this floor can be found through Google, YouTube, or a good retro video game store. However, having everything cleverly displayed on the same floor does feel unique and may lead to some new discoveries.</p><p>For example, while the Wii U might not exactly be Nintendo’s most successful console, seeing it on display between Nintendo’s other consoles made me rediscover its importance. Major modern franchises such as Splatoon and Mario Maker debuted there, the idea of being able to play games on both your TV and a portable device that made the Nintendo Switch so popular was conceived, and the Amiibo product lineup launched during the Wii U era.  </p><p>Of course, Nintendo wasn’t making video games when the company was founded way back in 1889. It all started with Hanafuda cards and later expanded to playing cards in North America, where they collaborated with Disney. Some visitors will be surprised to see products that feature Mickey Mouse, Lady and the Tramp and Bambi, instead of  Mario, Pikachu and Kirby.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-shigureden-sp-04-1727233835297.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Looking at Nintendo’s older products, it becomes obvious that Nintendo already had that playful and inventive spirit long before they started to expand their business into video games. From playing cards, they went on to produce a wide array of board games that came in all sorts of themes, to even a baby stroller and  “light telephone”, which is  an obscure device that uses light to transport sound.  It was thought of by Gunpei Yokoi, best known as the father of the GameBoy. Yokoi’s unique ideas like the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine and the Love Tester made Nintendo even more unique in the late 60’s, w eventually shapeshifting  into the inventive video game company it istoday. </p><p>The museum presents the history of Nintendo and its characters through different, creative, themes, showing how elements like the  Nintendo logo changed over time, how Mario’s question block evolved, the history of products that incorporate music, and products played by moving the body.</p><p>While there isn’t all that much to learn for Nintendo fans who have done their homework, seeing everything come together in a well designed space functions as a celebration of the company’s rich history.</p><p>While you will probably be left disappointed if you were hoping to see never-before-seen,  behind-the-scenes material, prototypes of the Nintendo Dolphin, the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board are present. But for some reason these items were displayed discreetly at the back of the exhibition floor.</p><p>The first floor has a wide array of interactive activities to enjoy.These activities, which are themed after Nintendo’s past products, have the playfulness that people have come to expect from Nintendo’s games. To be honest, I wasn’t exactly impressed when I saw Shigeru Miyamotoshoot at goombas at the museum’s shooting gallery or hit furniture with the Ultra Machine’s batting-cage experience during last month’s Nintendo Museum Direct. However, once I got to experience these myself, I couldn’t help but smile at the care that Nintendo put into these simple yet cute experiences.</p><p>At the shooting gallery, my Zapper was accurate enough to hit targets that were quite far away. At the end of the game, each player's score is counted simultaneously, making it exciting to see who got the highest score. </p><p>And the little reactions of the objects that you hit with the Ultra Machine are so cute that I wanted to try every one of the different rooms available. While humble when compared to the kind of spectacle you can experience at the bigger theme park, Super Nintendo Land  , the simple but thorough production feels very Nintendo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-ultra-hand-sp-1727233835298.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another interactive exhibit let guests play cooperative games using giant NES, SNES and N64 controllers but it proved more difficult than expected. We often found ourselves laughing out loud at our embarrassing faliures.</p><p>I especially enjoyed holding a giant Wii Remote together with my colleague to fly around above Wuhu Island, the main location of Wii Sports Resort. A sea-plane can be steered by tilting the Wii Remote up, down, left, and right, to break balloons. It is a game that uses the entire body, which felt like a full-scale embodiment of the Wii’s motion controls. Considering that this is a game that can only be experienced at the Nintendo Museum, it is something that Nintendo fans should not miss, maybe even more so than the items at the exhibition floor.</p><p>The Love Tester, which measures the level of romance between two players is also an  ideal icebreaker if you’re on a date. Players are told to hold hands or stare at each other and from there, they are tasked to scare away rats and dodge obstacles to keep the balloons attached to their heads safe,moving their hands and head like they would in a Microsoft Kinect game. It's a simple experience, but one that has the uncanny effect of strengthening bonds with the people you are playing with.</p><p>These life-size Mario Party style mini games lets guests interact directly with parts of Nintendo’s history. And it’s through these various experiences that Nintendo showcases its history. As a company that always focused on fun and interactivity, this felt like a natural approach to a museum that celebrates their history. </p><p>However, not all of these experiences can be enjoyed in one visit. The Play Ticket that you receive upon entry comes with only 10 coins, which you can spend to play the experiences. The amount of coins required varies depending on the experience, but don’t expect to be able to enjoy more than 4 or 5  experiences in one visit. On top of that, visitors will likely have to stand in line for each activity once the museum opens to the public, though the wait is helped thanks to the iconic Nintendo music playing through the halls </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/exhibition-building-1-entrance-1727233835294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although the museum doesn’t have the scale and spectacle of Universal Studios’ Nintendo area, the facility is packed with little secrets and easter eggs. Finding each little detail almost feels like exploring a sandbox in Super Mario Odyssey. From Excite Bike characters on the wall, to Mario hanging on a goal pole, and even a  Pikmin on the top of the museum roof, you are constantly rewarded for carefully observing the environment. </p><p>The lack of never-before-seen historical items and limited explanation can make Kyoto’s Nintendo Museum feel lacking in the traditional sense of the word ‘museum.’ However, its striking exhibition floor, fun, but simple, activities, and attention to detail made me feel like I was enjoying a cozy Nintendo game. </p><p>Observing, exploring and playing my way through the facility, I was subconsciously experiencing the company’s rich history in a unique way. While there may not be much new to see or learn about the company’s full history for the die-hard Nintendo fan, visiting the museum reminds you of why you fell in love with the games in the first place. For those less familiar with Nintendo or video games in general, the museum’s interactive nature makes it something that anybody should be able to enjoy anyway.</p><p>Nintendo Museum opens its doors to the public on October 2.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

            <p>Developer Riot has issued a statement to distance itself from a strike by SAG-AFTRA actors' union members against its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> game.</p>
<p>Last night, the actor's union called a strike against Riot's online game due to its connection to Formosa Interactive LLC. Formosa Interactive is a production company involved in making League of Legends, and one which SAG-AFTRA has accused of trying to "subvert the video game strike", which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">announced in July</a>. </p>
<p>The union's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-strikes-league-legends">press release</a> stated <a href="https://formosagroup.com/interactive-projects/">Formosa</a> - which has also worked on the Call of Duty series, Zelda and God of War, among others - attempted to "cancel" one of its games affected by the SAG-AFTRA video game strike in order to continue with non-union actors.</p>
<p>Since then, Riot has issued its own statement, writing "League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned" by SAG-AFTRA.</p>

<p>"We want to be clear: since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise," Riot wrote on social media platform X.</p>
<p>"In addition, we've never asked Formosa to cancel a game that we've registered. All of the allegations in SAG-AFTRA's press release relating to cancelling a game or hiring non-union talent relate to a non-Riot game, and have nothing to do with League or any of our games."</p>
<p>In the press release announcing SAG-AFTRA's League of Legends strike, the union said it believes the actions by Formosa to be "a flagrant violation of labour law" . As such, SAG-AFTRA "has filed an unfair labour practice charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned in SAG-AFTRA’s press release.

</p></div>
<p>SAG-AFTRA claims that when Formosa was told it was not possible to "cancel " one of its struck video games, the company "secretly transferred the game to a shell company and sent out casting notices for 'non-union' talent only". In protest, the union called its strike on League of Legends, as this is one of the most high-profile games Formosa has worked on.</p>
<p>"It's bad enough that Formosa and other companies are refusing to agree to the fair AI terms that have been agreed to by the film, television, streaming, and music industries, as well as more than 90 other game developers," said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA.</p>
<p>"To commit illegal unfair labour practices is beyond the pale and won't be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members."</p>
<p>Many video game performers, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-and-commander-shepard-stars-discuss-threat-of-ai-on-voice-acting">Solid Snake actor David Hayter and Commander Shepard actor Jennifer Hale</a>, have shared their concerns about AI and its impact on their work.

<p>Following yesterday's State of Play, well-known ResetERA user shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot43-juan-last-time.971316/post-129213615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that the three games mentioned above may not be the only big titles releasing during the course of next year without providing additional information on these unannounced potential 2025 games. Many PlayStation Studios, like Naughty Dog, Bend, and Bluepoint, have yet to reveal their current projects, so there's definitely the chance for 2025 to be a much better year than 2024 for Sony in regards to exclusive releases.</p>
<p>While it has been known for a while that Death Stranding 2 would hit Sony's current generation console <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/">next yea</a>r, we had no idea before yesterday's State of Play that Ghost of Yotei, Ghost of Tsushima's highly-anticipated sequel, would also be released in 2025. From the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/"> reveal trailer</a>, it's clear how the second entry in the series will feature a familiar experience vastly enhanced from a visual standpoint by the power of the PlayStation 5, which allowed for the creation of realistic wind movement on vegetation, better skyboxes, and more. Gameplay will also be improved with new weapons and gameplay mechanics that have yet to be detailed in full.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play broadcast, BioWare premiered two new Dragon Age: The Veilguard videos. One is a deep dive on the Mage class, and another is dedicated to a boss fight against a Blighted Ice Dragon. Producer Hilary Hidey walked Dragon Age: The Veilguard fans through her process of building the Mage character:</p>
<p><em>As a Mage, I can switch between two weapon sets: a staff for ranged attacks or an elemental orb and dagger for close-quarter combat. I'm facing off against an ice dragon, which is vulnerable to fire, so I've equipped Urthemiel's Ash as my elemental orb. It reduces enemy damage, makes burning last longer and do more damage, and increases the cap of burning stacks. My dagger, Thorn of Misfortune, gives me access to the physical damage type and synergizes with my affliction-based build, increasing the damage of Arcane Bombs, which I build up with repeated orb attacks. I've further powered up my afflictions by equipping this Death Mask, which will give me a nice damage boost. </em></p>
<p><em>Let's switch to my Dragon Age: The Veilguard character skill tree, where I further enhanced my ability to take on this ice dragon. Elemental Catalyst gives my abilities +15% bonus damage, in this case, fire damage, since both my staff and orb are fire-based. Inner Focus generates 25% extra mana from successful light attacks, and that number is doubled against enemies suffering from an affliction, like burning, so each time I attack my burning enemies, I'll generate 50% extra mana, allowing me to cast powerful spells like Meteor more often. The Spellblade specialization blends magic and melee. With the Electrical Burns passive, my fire attacks stack even more afflictions on my targets, applying the shocked affliction whenever I apply burning (and vice versa). Finally, my Spellblade Ultimate ability Thunderous End unleashes a massive amount of damage, shocking enemies in a wide radius.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard producer goes on to show some synergizes and combos with the companions. Once the dragon is staggered, she primes the Sundered status with Lucanis and triggers it with her own character. Normally, she would have to wait a few seconds until Lucanis's ability is once again available, but the Regroup rune instantly refreshes companions' cooldowns, allowing her to repeat the combo right away. The dragon is then finished off with the aforementioned Ultimate ability, Thunderous End.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>? I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-in-random-review">reviewed it</a> way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.</p>

<p>The hideous pot creature is called Potboy and you'll need to use his flame "to light your way through a conflicting world of wonder and horror". In the trailer, some old fella says "Who took the sun away?", which hints at this clay world being lost to darkness for a long time (cue flashbacks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> lore). And thus, why all the dribbly, wrinkly nasties want a bite of your Potboy's flame.</p>
<p>What's pretty extraordinary is the art style, where everything's been sculpted from clay and scanned into the game. It's paired with stop motion animation, too, so the world has an appropriately clumpy feel to it.</p>
<p>It seems like the game's story will be split into "five tales of fire and darkness" and you'll meet a bunch of weirdos on your late night amble. Like a house on legs, a guy with a big hat, and a person with an umbrella. Otherwise, it seems like we'll get to wield a matchstick like it's a shotgun and have Potboy fire some sparks out of his head to light up pathways?</p>
<p>We don't know a great deal more, but what I do know is that I'm cautiously excited for it. It's due out sometime in 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">Steam</a> and will be on Steam VR, too. For the VR version, it seems like it'll use eye-tracking, so you can close your eyes "to focus on the sounds and manipulate the world around you". Huh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> will not be releasing on PS5 in Japan for the time being.</p>
<p>Last night during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">PlayStation's State of Play broadcast</a>, developer Pocketpair announced its monster-catching survival game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">available to play for the first time on Sony's console</a>.</p>
<p>However, while Palworld has debuted on PS5 across 68 countries and regions worldwide, it has not yet been released in Japan.</p>

<p>This detail was revealed by Palworld's Japanese social media team early this morning.</p>
<p>In a post shared on X, the account said "the release date in Japan has not yet been decided"  (Google translated).</p>
<p>"We apologise to everyone in Japan who was looking forward to it, but all of our staff will do our best to deliver it to PS5 users as soon as possible, so we hope you will wait for a little longer," it continued. "We look forward to your continued support of Palworld."</p>
<p>While a reason for Japan's PS5 omission was not given, it is fair to surmise it has something to do with the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>. Pocketpair claims it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">unaware of which patents it has infringed</a>, though recent reports suggest it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patent to do with how players throw Pokéballs</a>.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Ahead of its release, many dubbed Palworld 'Pokémon with guns' due to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">similarities with Nintendo's own creature-catching game</a>. Palworld was the first big mega-hit of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">surpassing 2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Pocketpair and Sony for further comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>When you stare into the PlayStation Showcase, it stares also into you. Open world samurai action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost Of Tsushima</a> is getting a follow-up called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost Of Yotei</a>, developers Sucker Punch have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/">announced</a> (or Ghost Of Yōtei, to include the technically-correct-but-annoying-to-reproduce-on-UK-keyboards diacritic that I will hereby drop to secure our sanity). It looks very picturesque and, like its predecessor, inspired by the Kurosawa showdowns of old. You can see for yourself in the trailer that acted as the finale of Sony's marketing show.</p>

<p>You'll be slitting throats as Atsu, a "wandering warrior" seemingly out for revenge. This time the game will be set in Hokkaido, Japan, we're told, in the lands surrounding Mount Yōtei, a snowcapped mountain in the southwest of the island. The year is 1603, which is Japan's Edo period and much later than the first game's historical setting of  the 13th century. Which is a more familiar setting in terms of Japanese history as depicted in modern media (well it is to me, at least).   </p>
<p>"In 1603, this area was outside the rule of Japan," say the developers, "and filled with sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers. It’s a far cry from the organized samurai clans who lived in Tsushima..."</p>
<p>There's no strict PC confirmation yet, but considering the previous game eventually came to Steam in the form of the sparkly Director's Cut edition, we're guessing this will also make its way to our thundering beastrigs. Not sure if it too will be hobbled by the slightly irritating need to have a PSN account, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">the first game did</a>. We never did get around to reviewing it, but James did report that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-runs-well-on-steam-deck-making-its-psn-nonsense-all-the-more-annoying">it runs quite well on the Steam Deck</a>. </p>
<p>We're promised more details in the months to come "including details about Atsu’s journey and the people (and animals) she’ll meet along the way." Putting this parenthetical mention of animals together with the wolf in the above trailer, and I'm guessing our killer has some affinity with wildlife that will come in handy somehow. Atsu herself will be played by voice actor Erika Ishii, aka Valkyrie from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, aka Dr Wenjie from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, aka the female player character Rook from the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last year we reported horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> would be getting a couple of expansions. We've already had one of these in the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-is-getting-a-three-episode-night-springs-expansion-tomorrow">Night Springs</a>. And Edwin noted that the other would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-new-game-and-dlc-plans-include-what-can-only-be-a-control-crossover">probably be a crossover</a> with Remedy's other big game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a>, featuring secret government agency, the Federal Bureau of Control. He was right, judging by the trailer shown at yesterday's PlayStation Showcase. </p>
<p>The Lake House DLC is due out in October, and does indeed feature a facility run by the shady organisation whose job it is to keep powerful "altered items" from running amok. But it looks like somebody let a messed-up oil painting out of its cage.</p>

<p>The DLC is "set in an eerie new location on the shores of Cauldron Lake," say the developers, and runs parallel to the main story. It'll see you guiding FBC agent Kiran Estevez through the Lake House research station, "where reckless experiments have caused reality to collide with the Dark Place." Agent Estevez appeared as a character in Alan Wake 2 - a busybody who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUo2p8fbSkQ">rudely takes over the investigation</a> of player character Saga. Her name also pops up in <a href="https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Shaded_Specimen_Captured">briefly in some documents</a> in Control. </p>
<p>The trailer shows a hallway full of bodies, and a twisted painting that screams in an anguished voice: "Murderer! Pain! Misery! Hatred!" All right, calm down Mr Painting. What is this, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers Of Fear</a>? Get over yourself.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 is a "stylistic tour de force and one of the most unique and confident horror games in recent years," said Katharine (RPS in peace) in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">our review</a>. But she also noted that "the climax to Saga and Alan's story does drop the ball somewhat in its very final moments. Enough is resolved to not feel like it's a complete disappointment, but it also leaves just enough hanging in the air to feel faintly unsatisfying at the same time."</p>
<p>Maybe this second spooky slap of DLC will tie up some loose intestines. But if I know my weird storytelling rules, it'll stubbornly refuse to make everything <em>too</em> neat. </p>
<p>Remedy recently paired up with Annapurna to finance Control 2 and to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">produce TV and film adaptations</a> set in their cross-pollinating world of funnyscares. It's possible this publishing deal may be negatively affected by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">recent trouble at Annapurna Interactive</a>, where the entire staff resigned in what increasingly looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactive-has-splintered-into-two-groups-both-of-which-are-now-working-to-pick-up-the-pieces-says-new-report">a management power struggle</a>. Annapurna themselves <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/451240/control-2-remedy-annapurna-interactive-resignations">say otherwise</a>, though it certainly can't be helping.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You read that right – Battlestate Games has produced a line-up of exclusive merchandise it’ll be selling during the Tokyo Game Show, and one item on that list is a Shturman ‘waifu’ body pillow. It’ll set you back 10,000 yen – around $70 – and depicts an ‘anime girl’ dressed as Shturman and lying on a bed.</p>



<p>You will be judged if you buy this.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stupid-sexy-shturman">Stupid Sexy Shturman</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games revealed a whopping line-up of merchandise dubbed the ‘Tokyo Limited Edition’ line. It set the community ablaze, as at first glimpse, it seems it’s only available if you’re attending the Tokyo Game Show, which effectively alienates the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If you’re attending TGS, you can purchase items like framed prints, exclusive t-shirts, dog tags, figurines, stickers, tote bags, replica in-game items like keycards, and yes, a Shturman body pillow.</p>



<p>Here’s the full selection:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘anime waifu’ theme continues with acrylic cut-outs featuring female representations of The Goons, the trio of bosses that roam several maps in Escape from Tarkov. More regional-specific items such as a foldable fan and Japanese tea bags are available.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games typically goes big at conventions and gaming expos. During Gamescom 2023, the company set up a huge booth for Escape from Tarkov Arena, which was being released just months later. Earlier in 2024, the firm appeared at the last Insomnia Gaming Festival event in the United Kingdom, once again presenting a themed and immersive Arena experience.</p>



<p>Are you mad that you’re missing out on this merchandise, and do you hope that Battlestate Games makes it available to purchase after the Tokyo Game Show? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>Something magical occurred to me this morning: fit-flaying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Monster Hunter Wilds will be the first time I get to play a Monster Hunter game while also being a cat dad. It’s going to great! “What’s that, eh?!” I’ll say, pointing to a Doshaguma in a manner that might foolishly suggest I expect her to give a damn. “Mraow”, she’ll reply, knock over my coffee, then go back to sleep. “It’s you!” I’ll exclaim, pointing to the Palico I’ve spent six hours making look just like her. “That looks nothing like me, you odorous lummox,” she’ll insinuate with a cocked eyebrow, then go shout at an ant for a bit.</p>
<p>Ah well, at least I have videogames - this one is out on the 28th of Febwar, 2025. Here’s a trailer from last night’s Sony-me-doo:</p>

<p>As expected, it looks vast and beautiful, although I’m still deeply disturbed by the choice to have the Palico’s speak human language. I was such a fan of their silly cat puns that I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-cat-jokes-and-beast-names-of-monster-hunter-world-are-translated-into-english">interviewed the localisation team</a> a while back, and I’m just not convinced they’ll hit quite the same spoken out loud. Also present is the series’ traditional “this creature whose territory we’ve just invaded to carve it up for parts is somehow hostile towards us. Plucky heroes, assemble!” which I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">about here</a>, but that’s par for the course by now. I’m past the point of trying to take Monster Hunter stories at all seriously - I simply wish to bonk a large lizard.</p>
<p>Misgivings aside, I’m a mark for the monst, and perhaps an even bigger mark for the RE Engine, so I cannot wait to stick my face in this, much like my cat has started sticking her face into the saucepan of boiled egg water when there’s <strong>fresh water right there</strong>, you tiny criminal. Our Edwin was privy to a demo for Wilds earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">you can find here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

An SSD is required, Microsoft's DirectStorage API is supported, and Frame Generation is listed as part of the Recommended spec.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows®10 (64-bit Required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel® Core™ i5-10600 or Intel® Core™ i3-12100F or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1660 Super(VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon™ RX 5600 XT(VRAM 6GB)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p (upscaled from 720 native resolution) / 30 fps under the "Lowest" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows®10 (64-bit Required)</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel® Core™ i5-11600K or Intel® Core™ i5-12400 or AMD Ryzen™ 5 3600X or AMD Ryzen™ 5 5500</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>

<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</li>
<li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong>&nbsp;SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p / 60 fps (with Frame Generation enabled) under the "Medium" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Frame Generation tidbit is interesting because the RTX 2070 Super does not support NVIDIA's DLSS 3 technology. However, CAPCOM might simply be taking into account that the RTX 2070 Super can enable AMD's FSR 3 instead. If that's the case, the requirements are rather hefty, as the Recommended spec only targets 1080p@60FPS with FG enabled and Medium graphics settings.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds runs on the RE Engine, which has generally proven to be rather lightweight. However, the first open-world game, Dragon's Dogma 2, definitely had more performance issues than the previously released linear games. The upcoming installment in the Monster Hunter franchise also uses open-world design.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-awakening-preview-the-closest-to-the-apocalypse-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-want-to-be.991356/</guid>

<p>Metro Awakening is an upcoming VR game that expands on the well-established post-apocalyptic franchise with an all-new, original story. It’s expected to be released before the year is out, giving players on PC, PlayStation, and Meta Quest the opportunity to explore a harrowing, mutant-ridden adventure from a terrifyingly close perspective.</p>



<p>I had the opportunity to play a solid trial of Metro Awakening at Gamescom in August. If I hold my hands up, it was one of the first VR games I’d ever played, but days after I experienced Metro Awakening, I’d invested in a Meta Quest 3.</p>



<p>Do with that information what you will.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-deep-deep-down">Deep, Deep Down</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is set in 2028, around seven years before the events of Metro Exodus, the last main game in the series that was released back in 2019. Players assume control of Serdar, a survivor of the nuclear apocalypse and now a resident of Moscow’s dank, horrifying subway ecosystem.</p>



<p>As Serdar, players will venture through the underground catacombs and tunnels, searching desperately for his wife in a race against time to save her life. It’s a quintessential Metro adventure rife with mutant creatures, slim-to-nil resources, and darkness and danger lurking around every turn.</p>



<p>The first thing that struck me as a long-time Metro fan was the authenticity of the game. It has been compiled by Vertigo Games, and the team has done a fantastic job representing the inherent intensity of a Metro game in VR form. From the moment I passed through the game’s tutorial section and was plunged into the metro system of Moscow, I was <strong>immersed</strong>.</p>



<p>On the artistic front, it looks remarkably similar to Metro Exodus, right down to the clarity of the visuals. I’ve played a few VR games since then but nothing has managed to come close to the sheer atmosphere presented in Metro Awakening. It has been compiled so well that the version I played could have been packaged up and released to the market then and there.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-generation-horror">Next-Generation Horror</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you’ve ever been creeped out by some of the more eerie elements of the Metro series, prepare to have your timbers well and truly shivered in Metro Awakening. I was jumpscared by mutants, crawled on by giant spiders, and forced to confront a suffocating darkness with nothing but a flickering torch and a homemade lighter in my hands.</p>



<p>Everything from inventory mechanics to how you use weapons and equipment feels intuitive and natural in Metro Awakening. I got to grips with it after little more than a few minutes, and the attendant at the booth was surprised I’d essentially never played a VR game before.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how true to the franchise Metro Awakening remains. It helps that it has always been an immersive FPS series, but the VR perspective takes things one step further, planting you as close to the post-apocalyptic world as you’d ever want to be. I found myself probing every nook and cranny, opening every box and locker, and constantly checking my weapons and equipment to make sure I was in tip-top shape.</p>



<p>I haven’t been able to confirm how long the game is, but I’d assume it’s at least a few hours long. Beyond the launch of the game, I’m also not sure what’s coming next, but as soon as I have that information, I’ll happily share it. I’m hoping it doesn’t end the base game, because Metro Exodus had some fantastic expansions.</p>



<p>If you’ve been waiting for a solid new VR shooter, don’t sleep on Metro Awakening. It’s phenomenal.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/console-us-spending-declines-ghost-of-tsushima-resurgence-validates-sonys-pc-strategy/">Ghost of Tsushima</a> was one of the most popular games released in 2020, with the game being nominated for an immense amount of awards, as well as winning a fair amount of them. Today, the sequel, Ghost of Yotei, was showcased in the State of Play, which takes players to a brand new era of Japan. While Ghost of Tsushima took place during the first Mongol invasion of Japan, which took place in 1274, Ghost of Yotei is moving things along in time and taking players to 1603, the Sengoku period of Japan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7z7kqwuf0a8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ghost of Yotei will take place in the area surrounding Mount Yotei, which is located in modern-day Hokkaido, which was known as Ezo during the Sengoku period. Atsu is the protagonist of this game, and immediately, the gameplay looks very familiar in this new trailer. Players will get to enjoy features that were an essential part of Ghost of Tsushima, such as horseback riding and plenty of swordfights. While Atsu is exploring in the trailer, she has a Shamisen across her back, and there are plenty of features of a wolf, possibly her pet.</p>
<p>The game is shaping up to take players through grasslands, tundras and other dangers that players will have to try and navigate safely. Much like Tsushima, players will get to explore a new region of Japan and admire the beauty at their own pace.</p>
<p>For Sucker Punch, this is their first game that is built from the ground up for PlayStation 5, with huge improvements and features to the aesthetics and world-building, such as believable movement on wind on grass and vegetation, skyboxes filled with stars and auroras, as well as new mechanics, gameplay improvements and new weapons for players to utilize and experiment with.</p>
<p>All of these statements are explained in the<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> blog post</a> that was posted on the PlayStation website by Andrew Goldfarb, who is the Communications Manager at Sucker Punch Productions.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ghost of Yotei doesn't have a specific release date, but it will be released sometime during 2025. Hopefully, players will get to see Ghost of Yotei arrive on PC later in the future, the same way Ghost of Tsushima did with the Director's Cut of the game.</p>

It will launch in Early Access via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3103780/DRAPLINE/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in spring 2025, with ENglish, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese language support. <span id="more-917293"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><div><p><strong>■ The Author’s Comments Have Arrived for the First Non-Adventure Game in a While! We Are Working Hard to Get It Ready for Early Access Next Spring!</strong></p><p><em>DRAPLINE</em>, the game recently published on the Steam store, is the latest non-adventure-style game from indie game developer Kanawo. Kanawo is known for developing highly talked- about <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,772 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a> such as <em>Noel the Mortal Fate</em>, which has been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4, and the game version of Sanrio Company, Ltd.’s buzzworthy <em>MaiMai Maigoen</em>. This new title marks Kanawo’s return to non-adventure style games after a long period.</p><p>The game falls into the roguelite genre with strong nurturing game elements. Despite a short playtime of about one hour to reach the final boss, it offers a wide variety of strategies and developments based on each player’s nurturing approach. It aims to be a game that can be easily and repeatedly played multiple times. Note: “Adventure,” in the context of Japanese gaming, typically refers to <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [462 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a>-style games.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DRAPLINE_2024_09-25-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Moreover, this game is being developed with the goal of releasing it as a work in progress, allowing early access players to participate in its development. The aim is to start Early Access early next year (planned for spring). Furthermore, at the time of the full release scheduled for next year, the game is planned to support Japanese, English, and Simplified Chinese languages.</p><p>The following is a comment from the game developer, Kanawo:</p><p>“It’s been over 10 years since I first released a game I made myself. In recent years, I’ve focused on creating adventure games like <em>Noel the Mortal Fate</em> that immerse players in a single story. However, this new game aims to be something I’d want to buy on Steam right now—a game that can be played repeatedly in short sessions, where you can enjoy building your own strategies and builds, and that has various endings. I’m developing this game with a fresh feeling, as if returning to my roots from 10 years ago, and I’m incredibly excited about it every day!</p><p>“Currently, I’m working on about the first third of the game while verifying core functions and parameters. I’m also releasing development versions exclusively to supporters on pixivFANBOX. The feedback from those who have played the current version in advance has been excellent, and I personally feel very positive about it. Above all, I’m having an incredible amount of fun developing it.</p><p>“Eventually, I’d like to release a demo version more widely and conduct an Early Access on Steam to receive feedback from more users, actively adjusting balance and adding features. After the Early Access begins next spring, I plan to frequently update Steam news with each update, so please add it to your Steam wishlist and stay tuned!”</p><p><strong>Game Description</strong></p><p>A calamity threatening the world is imminent… Raise the starving baby dragon you happened to find into your very own strongest dragon daughter!

A Story of Raising a Dragon Girl to Save the World From “Destruction”</strong></p><p>The title <em>DRAPLINE</em> is a coined word by game developer Kanawo, combining the meanings of “dragon” and “discipline,” referring to training a dragon’s daughter. The plot is as straightforward as the name suggests: properly raise a dragon daughter you happened to find to save the world from “destruction.”</p><p><em>—Meal Selection Screen: Players raise Coo, a dragon daughter, in a village with exotic scenery.

However, just buying affordable ingredients won’t always allow you to raise her as you wish.</p><p><em>—<a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>n and Happy Financial Company “Happy Cait Sith Loan”: You’ll often find yourself borrowing money from the financial company to buy unusual, expensive food, and having to repay with interest while feeding Coo.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/DRAPLINE_2024_09-25-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Moreover, the variety of things you can feed her is surprisingly wide.

			<p>The expansion Alan Wake 2: The Lake House was unveiled today during the September 2024 State of Play. Fans got a first look at the upcoming expansion in a trailer released by Remedy. Fans already expected this expansion to be released sometime in October, and this was confirmed once again, albeit with no specific date. Furthermore, a more detailed synopsis for fans to dive into. While the trailer didn't expose too many details, it became obvious that the story centered around the Federal Bureau of Control, with the station being set inside the Lake House.</p>
<p>Instead of playing as Alan Wake, this time, you'll be playing as Kiran Estevez, an FBC agent, as the story takes place parallel to the main game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alan Wake 2 – The Lake House Expansion Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UHfs75K-y4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House is clearly linked to Remedy's other major franchise, Control, as part of the so-called <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-qa-sam-lake-on-the-remedy-connected-universe-and-moving-toward-open-world-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy Connected Universe</a> (which will now be expanded into film and television following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with Annapurna Pictures</a>).</p>
<p>The previous Alan Wake 2 DLC, Night Springs, featured three episodes with three different protagonists, one of whom was Control's main character, Jesse Faden. Reviewer Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-2-night-springs-unpredictable-narrative-insanity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 8.5 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>While it does not offer much in terms of gameplay, the Alan Wake 2: Night Springs expansion is a worthy DLC to experience for all fans of the base game and Remedy Entertainment's titles. Free from the limitations imposed by the base game's narrative, which was fairly loose to begin with, Sam Lake and his team have gone all out to provide some extremely entertaining scenarios that, unfortunately, are over way too soon and leave the player wanting more. Hopefully, the next expansion, Lake House, will offer something a bit meatier to complement the masterful storytelling that is as well showcased in Night Springs as it is in the base game.</em></p>
