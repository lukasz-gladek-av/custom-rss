<p>Use these Roblox Endzone Strike monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including draws, ball skins and much more.</p>



<p>Endzone Strike fuses high-energy anime action with American football in a unique <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-pet-capture-adventure-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that’s taking the platform by storm. This isn’t your standard sports simulator – it’s a high-octane battle of special moves, character collection, and strategic team building. Players start with basic characters and limited abilities, then work their way up to fielding a squad of powerhouse athletes with flashy special attacks. Each match earns you Strike Points that serve as the game’s main currency. </p>







<p>These points are your ticket to recruiting new players through the gacha-style summoning system, upgrading existing team members, and purchasing equipment that boosts performance. While grinding matches steadily builds your team, the developers regularly release redemption codes on social media and Discord events that grant instant Strike Points, exclusive character skins, or limited-time power-ups.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-endzone-strike-codes">How To Get More Endzone Strike Codes</h2>



<p>Endzone Strike codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media accounts. This includes the No Skill Games Discord group, where the team often shares codes during game updates, milestones, and special events. New codes typically appear during significant game updates, when the community reaches milestones (like the recent “10KMEMBERS” code celebrating 10,000 Discord members), or as compensation when there are technical issues with the game.</p>



<p>However, keeping track of all these sources can be time-consuming, especially since there is no notification system to alert players when codes expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Endzone Strike codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 has now been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-six-months-since-launch-how-would-you-rate-switch-2">available for six months</a>, and during this time, there have been multiple Switch game compatibility updates.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've now got another batch of titles that are now fully functioning on Nintendo's new hybrid system. The highlight of the lot is the Aspyr release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_republic_commando">Star Wars: Republic Commando</a>, with the official Nintendo <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100fa10115f8000">compatibility search page</a> also reflecting this update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update 12/16/2025 - Previously identified issues have been resolved with an update.</p>

<p>More Kairosoft titles have also been updated this week and are now "supported" on the Switch 2. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_league_story">Pocket League Story</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story_2">Mega Mall Story 2</a>. This follows other titles from this same developer being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/multiple-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">updated in recent weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove</a> tied to audio problems in some parts of the game.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, Warner Bros. released an update earlier this week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> featuring performance, visual and stability improvements when playing the game through backwards compatibility on the Switch 2. There are also some improvements on the original Switch.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordprotect-online-identity-service-covers-up-to-10k-in-scam-losses-now-going-for-peanuts-2000655012</link>
            <guid>1389271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last shopping rush before Christmas is a great time for cybercriminals because there are so many online transactions, quick purchases, and distracted shoppers. NordProtect’s decision to lower the price of its <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">identity protection service to a record low of $4.49 per month, down from its usual $14.99 rate</a>, is especially important this time of year, when prices are usually lower.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another holiday sale on electronics or entertainment subscriptions that people don’t care about: Identity theft protection deals with a basic security issue that gets worse around the holidays, when fake transactions blend in more easily with real spending patterns and stolen credentials are more actively traded on criminal networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>Think about how bad identity theft is in the United States right now. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost $12.5 billion to fraud last year alone. This is a 25% increase from the year before. In 2024, the agency handled more than 1.1 million identity theft complaints. This means that a new victim came forward every 22 seconds throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Identity Theft by the Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every 22 seconds:</strong> A new identity theft case occurs in the United States</li>
<li><strong>1.1 million:</strong><span> Identity theft complaints filed with the FTC in 2024</span></li>
<li><strong>$12.5 billion:</strong><span> Total consumer losses to fraud in the past year</span></li>
<li><strong>44%:</strong><span>&nbsp;Percentage of identity theft cases involving credit card fraud</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These risks are even higher during the holidays: More people shopping online means more chances for data theft, and when there are a lot of legitimate transactions, it’s harder to spot fake charges right away. Phishing attempts that look like shipping notifications or seasonal sales alerts are on the rise, and retailers and payment processors are at greater risk of breaches because their infrastructure is under stress and they have to hire temporary workers.</p>
<h2>How Protection Really Works</h2>
<p>Instead of checking identities by hand every so often, NordProtect uses continuous automated surveillance. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">read Gizmodo’s review here to learn more about it</a>. <strong>NordProtect checks credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, looks for personal information on dark web marketplaces, and keeps an eye on linked financial accounts for strange activity.</p>
<p>The part that watches the dark web is especially important: There are parts of the internet (dark web) where stolen Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and full identity packages are traded. When your information shows up in these places, it usually means that there has been a security breach in one of the services you use. Early detection is important because it gives you time to lock down accounts before criminals can use the information.</p>
<p><strong>TransUnion’s credit monitoring service</strong> can catch things like new loan applications, account openings, or changes to your credit limit that you didn’t authorize. The system marks these events right away instead of waiting for monthly reviews of credit reports. When you monitor your bank account, you can spot strange withdrawal patterns, suspicious transfer requests, or debit card use that isn’t safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>The value proposition goes beyond just alerts: NordProtect gives you specific instructions on what to do when it finds a problem. If your email is part of a data breach, you will be told which accounts need new passwords, which security questions need to be changed, and whether or not two-factor authentication should be turned on. The service explains how to dispute charges that are not real and how to freeze your credit if they do.</p>
<h2>Financial Protection That Goes Beyond Monitoring</h2>
<p>Most people don’t realize how much it costs to recover from identity theft until they have to deal with it directly. For example, hiring a lawyer to fight fraudulent accounts can cost hundreds of dollars per hour. If you have to take time off work to deal with banks, creditors, and credit bureaus, you will lose money. And the costs of traveling to meet with law enforcement or financial institutions in person add up.</p>
<p><strong>NordProtect covers up to $1 million in identity theft recovery costs</strong>, including legal fees, lost wages, and documented costs related to restoring your identity and credit score.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Extra parts of insurance cover certain types of threats that aren’t usually covered by identity theft: Cyber extortion coverage pays up to $50,000 for cases of blackmail or ransom demands. Online fraud protection will pay up to $10,000 for money that is stolen directly from bank accounts or credit cards through digital scams. These amounts of coverage show how much damage advanced attacks can do.</p>
<p>Access to dedicated case management may be more valuable than money: When someone steals your identity, NordProtect sends a U.S.-based expert to handle the whole recovery process. This case manager talks to credit bureaus, files reports with banks and the police, keeps track of dispute deadlines, and keeps an eye on the case until it is resolved.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Preventing</h2>
<p>NordProtect is currently charging $4.49 a month, which is 71% less than the normal price and it is the lowest price the service has ever been offered at. This makes full identity protection cheaper than most streaming subscriptions or a single trip to a coffee shop. The service comes<strong> with a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to worry about losing money if it doesn’t meet your security needs.</p>
<p>Look at this cost next to the possible costs of recovery. The<em> Identity Theft Resource Center</em> says that people who have their identities stolen spend an average of 200 hours trying to fix the problem. Even at a low hourly wage, this means thousands of dollars in lost productivity. When you add up the costs of hiring a lawyer, buying credit monitoring services after the fact, and possible losses from fake transactions, prevention is much cheaper than reaction.</p>

Every game has its limitations, there is only so many actions you can take, narrative threads to unspool, buttons to press. What about a game that you can only play one round of every day? A game where you "take up the sword against an NPC or another girl-esque thing irl and fight until one of you is holding the lifeless, bloodstained hand of the other." This is the description of a tiny, visceral Yuri Game Jam game called Everyday Sororicide.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Blood Machine and Snek Remilia Ketter, Everyday Sororicide is self-described as a "tragic attempt at conveying the feeling of interacting with another girl on any level beyond superficiality." It is also a game of duels, as mentioned above, to the death. A 1v1 me on Final Destination, not items kind of game, each character bequeathed a sword with which you have a handful of actions. Stab, feint, dodge, jump, slam down, it is simple, yet particular; you have to watch for an opening, the girl-esque thing in front of you won't go down easily, all while drone music blares increasingly aggressively at you.

<p>
In its solo mode, you can only play it a single time a day. That's all. It is defiant in its structure, unwilling to bend to your wants of discovering more, of learning why these women feel such desperation to fight each other, of discovering a secret you didn't know you sought after. There's a mystery here made more tantalising by its refusal to be uncovered quickly.
</p><p>
That isn't to say this is a game you can only play once a day, as it actually has a multiplayer mode in which you can do battle with a mate, or, maybe someone you have a toxic situationship with. Seems like the right kind of game for such an activity.
</p>
<p>
If you too would like to figure out how to interact with another girl, you can pick up Everyday Sororicide on <a href="https://snekofspice.itch.io/everyday-sororicide">itch.io</a> for free.

            <p>
The thing about Big Business these days is that when you get Big Numbers, that normally leads to Bigger Business, right up to the point the well has not only dried up, but turned to dust. So, when you have a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, now winner of many Geoff Keighleys and seller of many copies, you might assume that developer Sandfall Interactive would increase the size of their operations. Apparently, you would be wrong!
</p>
<p>
As part of Edge's Knowledge newsletter (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/">GamesRadar</a>), director Guillaume Broche was asked about whether the studio's next project would be a "larger-scale production," to which he responded: "No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself."
</p>
<p>
He continued, "We could scale up now that we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves." Perhaps my favourite bit of the interview is where Broche says that they "love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."
</p>
<p>
Of course, it's still important to remember that discourse causing bit about the fact that Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wasn't made by just 30 people</a>, so it's not like the game was made by a teeny, tiny group of folks. Expansion may still happen, including through utilising more outsourced studios, but it's still nice to hear a company not chasing the money for once.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on December 18, and, as many could assume, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the awards</a> for Game of the Year and Debut Game. However, things have changed and The Indie Game Awards are making a big decision to strip the Clair Obscur and developer Sandfall Interactive of their awards over the use of gen AI in the game.</p>



<p>In an announcement made on Saturday afternoon, Six One Indie, the creators of the show, said that it’s removal comes after the discovery after voting was done, and the show was recorded.</p>







<p><strong>“The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,”</strong> <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.”</strong></p>



<p>Six One Indie ended by thanking the community for being patient and providing feedback on the situation.</p>



<p><strong>“The organizational team behind the ceremony is a small crew with big ambitions, and The Indie Game Awards can only grow with your help and support,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We already can’t wait for the 2026 ceremony!”</strong></p>







<p>With Clair Obscur’s disqualification, the awards will now go to the runner ups. That means the award for Debut Game goes to Sorry We’re Closed while Game of the Year now goes to Blue Prince.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/</link>
            <guid>1389178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Most years, when looking around at the best sports and racing games of the year, the list is dominated by annual releases, partly because they are sometimes the only sports and racing games to hit shelves in the last twelve months. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/">Our list for 2024's best sports and racing games</a></strong> can certainly be defined by that, but 2025 is a different beast.</p>



<p>In fact, 2025 was a standout year for sports games and racing games, the likes of which we're not used to seeing. With that said, let's dig into our top picks for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-8-5-10">Mario Kart World (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-MarioKartWorld.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World was the first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, Mario Kart World was an expansive return for the franchise and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">the major first-party Nintendo launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It brought the series out of its tried-and-true racing formula and put players into a vast open world, littered with collectibles for players to find, mini-challenges, and the chance to just drive over to every track included in the game.</p>



<p>Grand Prix race tracks are connected with long-winding roads, rather than the game cutting to a loading screen and lining up all of the cars at the starting track. You could now also control your vehicle like it's a Tony Hawk game, with grindrails and tricks impacting gameplay to such a degree that we've seen shortcut clips that would've previously only been possible by actually glitching through the game.</p>



<p>All of that sounds great, and for the most part, it is, but the big question around it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/"> whether it was worth $80 or not</a>, as Mario Kart World was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title to bump up game prices by another $10.</p>



<p>While only you can decided for yourself if a game is worth the price of admission, Wccftech's Nathan Birch summarizes the game quite well in his review, writing, "<em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4-8-5-10">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tony-Hawk-Pro-Skater-34-Review-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 rounded out the remasters for the first four Tony Hawk games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of doing tricks like Tony Hawk, 2025 also saw Activision round out the remasters of the first four Tony Hawk Pro Skater games with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, though this time it was Iron Galaxy at the helm of its development, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">after Vicarious Visions was swallowed up by Blizzard.</a></p>



<p>Though it's not exactly the straightforward remaster/remake in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was, due to how much about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was changed, it is still able to capture the fun of those skating games and provide more than a solid escape for anyone wanting to revisit those titles.</p>



<p>As I said in my review, "<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-8-10">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Racing-CrossWorlds-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds made 2025 the year of the kart racer.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yet another kart racer on the list, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arrived later in the year to try and give Mario Kart World a run for its money. Depending on who you ask, it did exactly that, as it is an incredibly fast game stuffed to the brim with character collaborations and the kind of structure kart racing fans are more used to seeing.</p>



<p>While Mario Kart World looked to try something new, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds went for tried-and-true methods and tried to polish them to a near-perfect shine. It may not have perfectly hit its mark, but it at the very least brushed Mario Kart in a way that Nintendo would do well to remember. Because the next time a Sonic game and a Mario Kart game go head-to-head, the plumber's reign may just be toppled by a blue blur.</p>



<p>Nathan Birch's review summarized how close Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds gets perfectly, writing, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-f1-25-8-10">F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F1-25.png"></a><figcaption><em>EA Sports F1 25. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The only annualized sports game in our top five list, F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-f1-26-not-happening-f1-25-major-expansion-f1-27/">which won't actually count as an annualized release next year since EA and Codemasters are skipping F1 26</a>), is able to inch into the list on the back of its established formula and known pedigree.</p>



<p>EA and Codemasters would have to actively sabotage the game at this point to turn out a bad one, and while it's a more than fair criticism to point out how little each new installment improves on the last when they are pumped out on a yearly basis, that doesn't diminish the overall quality on display.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray puts it in his review, "<em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-7-5-10">Rematch (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rematch-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rematch. Image credit: Sloclap</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The one entry on the list that isn't about what you can do on four wheels, Rematch, was a breath of fresh air in terms of the kinds of football games we're accustomed to. Sifu developer Sloclap took its experience in making extremely detailed, well-animated physical bodies that move with precision, and adapted that to a 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 arcade football game that plays like someone having the idea of taking the cars out of Rocket League and shrinking the ball down to the size a human would need.</p>



<p>Its launch was unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">marred by technical issues</a>, matchmaking problems, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">a lack of cross-play that was not announced until hours before the game would actually release</a>. It has improved on all of those fronts, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-crossplay-support-live-patch-3/">full cross-play support now included</a> and several bug-fixing updates having been pushed.</p>



<p>But it's unfortunate that these issues, along with a few issues with the UI/UX, caused it to stumble from the start, because outside of those problems, Rematch is arguably one of the best sports games to hit the market in years.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>



<p>The five games above are our top picks for the year overall, but there are still a few games worth mentioning that didn't make the cut. If you're a fan of sports and racing games, you would do well to check out these games too.</p>

            <p>
The end of a very short era is here! I guess, if you care about the life cycles of tech products made by multi-billion dollar companies. It appears that the days of the original LCD model of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> is coming to an end, as a quiet notice from Valve suggests their focus will be with the slightly newer, shinier OLED line of handheld gaming devices.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/valve-discontinuing-the-last-steam-deck-lcd-model/">GamingOnLinux</a>, heading to the store page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a> sees you being greeted with the usual spiel about how good it is, the games you can play on it, which models you can buy, and now, this note: "We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available." That kind of says it all really, but essentially, if you were putting off buying one, don't like buying tech second hand, and aren't particularly fussed about screen quality, there's your warning.
</p>
<p>
The original Steam Deck, this LCD model, launched back in February, 2022, so we're coming up to its fourth anniversary. Our own James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-review">liked it quite a lot back then</a>, and then a little under two years after it launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-the-steam-deck-oled-with-an-upgraded-screen-and-longer-battery-life">Valve announced the OLED model</a>. No real surprise there considering those Nintendo guys did the same thing, the difference there being they're still shifting original Switches alongside the OLED upgrade. I can only assume that Valve just aren't selling enough of the LCD version to justify its continued production.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next big thing for Valve right now is their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">new attempt at a Steam Machine</a>. A new Steam Deck will surely come at some point, though according to the House of Gabe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-have-to-keep-waiting-for-a-steam-deck-2-because-valve-says-the-tech-isnt-there-for-it-just-yet">you'll be waiting a while longer for it</a>. Perhaps an LCD model is all any of us really need right now.

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Accessible Games of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-accessible-games-of-2025</link>
            <guid>1389160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s December, meaning it’s the most wonderful time of the year. Yes, I’m cliché and enjoy the holidays for the warmth and celebrations they bring, but today I’m more interested in reflecting on the evolution of accessibility throughout 2025. And thankfully, this year brought improvements to long-standing franchises, as well as surprise additions to the triple-A and indie scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From my perspective, there were no accessibility moments that revolutionized the industry in 2025. Instead, the year demonstrated a continuous evolution of what disabled players have rightfully come to expect when purchasing a new release. In my opinion, no one game has been better than another, especially in terms of innovation, but that’s not to say this year didn’t surprise me in unexpected ways. So, for this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/columns/access-designed">Access Designed</a>, let’s explore some of my favorite examples of accessibility during 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: and Roger</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-and-roger-1765286660135.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This section contains mild spoilers for and Roger.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inclusion of TearyHand Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/and-roger">and Roger</a> on my list may surprise some. This roughly hour-long visual novel features numerous quick-time events that guide you through the loving memories of Sofia and her husband, Roger, as Sofia succumbs to dementia. Each minigame puts you directly in control of Sofia as she completes everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, making soup, or looking through old photographs. While these may seem mundane activities, Sofia’s dementia makes each simple event feel like a monumental task. And for disabled players, the intensity of the QTEs is exacerbated by the game’s notable lack of accessibility features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger features no accessibility tools to help you complete the game. There are no alternatives to finishing QTEs, options to skip them, or settings that have the game natively complete them for you like in this year's Assassin’s Creed Shadows. You are forced to continuously mash or perfectly drag a white button for every single QTE, something that was immensely exhausting with my physical disabilities. Yet, after completing an event within the first chapter that had Sofia push Roger’s hand away by rapidly mashing a button on the screen, I realized its inaccessibility made the experience much more powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger, through its lack of accessibility, made me reevaluate how I critique games, something I’ve been professionally doing for six years. Sofia’s struggles with dementia were far more pronounced when I was struggling with her. And in an industry where proper disability representation is still relatively lacking, and Roger masterfully captures the truest expression of disability. There are moments of love, grief, pain, joy, and suffering – all emotions I’ve personally felt or witnessed disabled friends and family experience. I have never played a game so dedicated to having, and occasionally forcing, the disabled experience on the players, thus making and Roger one of my favorite games of not only 2025, but of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: EA Sports FC 26</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-ea-sports-fc-26-1765286682630.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I will be the first to admit I don’t like sports games. The genre just doesn’t appeal to me, which is admittedly ironic considering I live in a very sports-centric city. Yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> made me appreciate soccer games (football for non-Americans) because of its incredible attention to accessibility detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FC 26, like most games with accessibility offerings, provides customizable controls, subtitles, and colorblindness settings. However, I appreciated the features for varying gameplay assists. Shooting, passing, defending, switching, and dribbling all have their own settings to provide relief during extended play sessions. When I was too fatigued to properly shoot, I would activate Auto Shots, which would trigger as I came close to the goal. If passing becomes too much, I can simply increase the sensitivity, making the game natively pass the ball without the need for immense precision. Even as the goalkeeper, I can use assists to help with saves. And for longer sessions, I can activate one or two button control schemes, significantly reducing the number of inputs needed to play (unfortunately, one and two button use cannot be used in competitive play).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, FC 26’s greatest accessibility achievement doesn’t impact my disability. For the first time in the series, as well as in a competitive multiplayer setting, players can activate High Contrast Mode. Everything from the home team, away team, referees, to even ball color can be customized to increase their contrast. This provides blind players with crucial visual information when playing frantic matches. It’s easy to lose control of player and ball position when matches become intense, especially with online PvP, but FC 26 redefines what accessibility can be in the competitive scene. The potential to challenge industry perspectives for competitive games is why FC 26 deserves a spot among the most accessible games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Doom: The Dark Ages</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-1765286697173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, id Software’s latest in the iconic FPS series, is by far my favorite entry, as well as its most accessible. While the newest game includes relatively common accessibility options like customizable controls, adjustable subtitles, and varying difficulty modes, The Dark Ages adds new tools that redefine accessibility in this fast-paced game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shooters like Doom rely on immense speed and precision to slaughter enemies and complete levels. You are constantly dodging enemy fire, sprinting through levels, jumping over obstacles, and switching weapons within your extensive arsenal to play the game. And if you don’t have the strength or stamina to perform any of the above, the gameplay formula becomes abysmally inaccessible, even with lowered difficulty settings. But The Dark Ages has a solution: it introduces modifiers that adjust game speed, enemy projectile speed, enemy aggression, player damage, and even enemy damage. Further, The Dark Ages includes options to change the parry windows for melee encounters. Every piece of the combat system is customizable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With accessibility, there’s often this incorrect notion within Internet spaces that options and inclusive designs ruin the intended gaming experience. The Dark Ages completely nullifies this argument with its customizable settings, which indicate that the "artistic intent" is the experience that you as a player want to have. There's no punishment for modifying the experience. Whether you have a disability or not, you control how you play. Are you a masochist that enjoys frantically throwing yourself against an onslaught of demons? Simply adjust every setting listed above to maximize their values. In my case, I would customize parry windows and game speed if I was particularly tired, but would find myself increasing enemy aggression for more of a challenge. I’ve never played a game that allows me to fine-tune every aspect of combat, and that is why Doom: The Dark Ages is my game of the year for 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three games represent only a fraction of the excellent accessible titles throughout 2025. Assassin’s Creed Shadows, South of Midnight, Split Fiction, and even Kirby Air Riders all deserve credit for their accessible tools and designs. And while the three games listed above are my personal favorite, 2025 has arguably been my favorite year as a critic, not for the innovations, but for the continued dedication to disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The actors who brought their A-game this year. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a tough few years for voice actors. While it’s perhaps never been more obvious how much value they provide to a game’s characters and story – the huge success of Baldur’s Gate 3 and its beloved cast put the profession in perhaps the brightest spotlight it’s ever had – voice actors and motion capture performers face a daunting threat in artificial intelligence. That’s just one of the reasons why we wanted to honor the art of performance in this year’s IGN Awards. Actors bring our games to life, and our digital worlds would be poorer without them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with our other awards, we asked the IGN team to nominate their favourite performances from across the past 12 months, and then we all voted for which one we felt was the very best example. These are our picks for the best individual performances in video games this year:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Performance in a Video Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Erika Ishii (Atsu, Ghost of Yotei)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-atsu-1766157147736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The role of a revenge-seeking samurai is well-trodden ground, but Erika Ishii breathed refreshing new life into Atsu, the protagonist of Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei. Lending the character a believable “rough around the edges” feel, Ishii ensures that Atsu’s bloodlust has depth. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Aaron Paul (Robert Robertson, Dispatch)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-robert-1766157163509.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Hollywood, which has long cast animated movies using celebrity movie stars, video games have predominantly held onto the idea that voice acting and performance capture is a distinct skill, and that hiring people who specialize in that is the way to go. But while Dispatch features industry titans like Laura Bailey and Matthew Mercer, it’s screen actor Aaron Paul who’s the standout; our review explains that he's able to deliver "a nuanced performance as a man struggling to hold onto his optimism while reconciling with who he is outside of his giant mech suit."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner–Up – Konatsu Kato (Hinako Shimizu, Silent Hill f)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-hinako-1766157181087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lending both her voice and likeness to Silent Hill f’s protagonist Hinako Shimizu, Konatsu Kato brought to life one of the series’ most tortured heroes. While many of us will have relied on subtitles to understand her Japanese-language lines, her delivery helped instill every scene with the heavy, complex emotions intended by the script’s nuanced tale.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Ben Starr (Verso, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-verso-1766157194477.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Verso, Ben Starr was able to take the gruff, dark hero voice he adopted for Clive in Final Fantasy 16 and perfect it. The maturity of Expedition 33’s themes, particularly in its final act, allow for Starr to explore a character who must revel in tragedy, but who carries enough optimism and conviction to never allow the dark to obscure the light. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Jennifer English (Maelle, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-maelle-1766157208759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Maelle is the heart of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and a major reason her journey rings so true is Jennifer English’s performance. Grief is a difficult emotion to wrestle with, especially when it’s part of a story that happily leans into the melodramatic, but English keeps Maelle eternally grounded and completely believable. Expedition 33 may be a game with flashy combat, monstrous deities, and an army of goofy paintbrush people, but what it’s really about is the human condition and, more specifically, how we deal with loss. As Maelle, Jennifer English ensures that Clair Obscur’s loftier, more literary themes and ambitions are never lost among the more video game-y, JRPG-inspired tropes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While individual performances are important, a strong ensemble cast can help bring a level of consistent immersion to a fictional world.

            <p>
I've always found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Big Brand Collabs slightly odd, if a touch humorous. They don't always make much sense to me, like the SpongeBob one, though I will admit that the Shrek one does feel like a good fit, even if I am loath to look at intellectual property. And now here we are with its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, with its first bit of DLC freshly announced, sending prospective powerwashers off to a distant land called Ooo from the seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to a brief Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/542251341653737956?l=english">blog post</a>, this particular bit of DLC will feature a total of five locations from the animated series, due out in spring, 2026. Not much was actually shown off of the pack itself, but the math fans out there will not be particularly surprised to see Finn and Jake's permanent residence the tree house, as well as the castle belonging to the Ice "wow this guy was a bit too creepy early on in the series, sure glad they toned that done" King.

<p>
A roadmap was outlined for upcoming DLC and updates coming to PowerWash Simulator 2, with two more paid packs coming in Q2 and Q3, alongside three rounds of Caldera Chronicles jobs that'll be available completely for free. Other free updates promised in the roadmap include very vague things like new features, bug fixes and quality of life improvements, furniture and skins, and community events - all which is caveated with a note that says "content could change based on community feedback or development in the future."
</p><p>
I'm sure some of that will be even more collabs, such is the way of the world, but I'm sure there will be at least a few of you out there who will be happy to clean up bits of the world of Adventure Time. A very specific thing to be happy about! Happy nonetheless.

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-claims-xbox-wrapped-2025-isnt-happening-this-year-due-to-marketing-budget-constraints</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>While every site you've ever visited in 2025 seems intent on summarising your year even for things you absolutely don't need to be summarised (the cards I completed in <a href="https://asana.com/year-in-review/log-in">Asana</a> this year? Uh, no thanks), there's one wrapped message you probably won't be getting this year: Xbox.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary">WindowsCentral's</a> Jez Corden, who recently suggested that the Xbox summary isn't just late this year, but may not be coming at all.</p>
<figure><div>

</div><figcaption> Is Valve's Steam Machine a Console or a PC?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvUxBl3pujs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Some of you have been asking me if Xbox would be doing its own Year in Review' style recap of your gaming habits for 2025," Corden wrote. "My sources suggest that Xbox is not doing a 'Wrapped' this year. And there's potentially a good reason."</p>
<p>As for what those good reasons are? Corden says next year will kick-off a "confluence of major anniversaries not just for Xbox, but some of its subsidiary properties too".</p>
<p>"Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, alongside Halo itself. Blizzard is also having its 35th anniversary, and Bethesda is having its 40th anniversary too," he stated. "Xbox was launched as a brand on November 15, 2001. Blizzard launched in February, 1991, and Bethesda launched in June, 1986.</p>
<p>"As such, a lot of the 'marketing budget' that would've typically been allocated to something like an Xbox Wrapped is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games."</p>
<p>Sony's 2025 Wrap-Up and Steam Replay 2025 are already live, by the way. If you've yet to see yours, head to the <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/en-gb">official website</a> for PlayStation, or pop over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/76561198023003792/2025">Steam</a> to see what's been keeping you busy there this year.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">flagging hardware sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams in January, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>

            <p>
I mean, all you can do is laugh, right? You've probably already guessed at what based on the headline, but we'll dig a little deeper into this all the same. Yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> has been delayed, the same Ark 2 that was revealed almost exactly five years ago, that was at one point in time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-is-out-in-2023-and-its-all-about-dads-dinos-and-vin-diesel">promised to release in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-has-been-delayed-so-theyre-switching-off-survival-evolved-and-charging-50-for-a-remaster">2024</a>, and then sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">half-heartedly slated for 2027</a>, before landing where we are now, with the news that the game is currently planned for release in 2028. Uhuh!
</p>
<p>
This comes from an interview with Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz over on the Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">blog</a> (stop stealing our thing, Mr. Sweeney. "One of the things about doing ARK 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases," Stieglitz said of the delay. "Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called ARK 2."
</p>
<p>
The studio founder spoke of how an expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> due for release in 2027, Legacy of Santiago, will introduce a number of combat mechanics that are planned for Ark 2, like its Soulsian third-person combat, but "it's not going to have all this like crazy narrative world build out content that we want to do with Ark 2."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of that narrative, it frankly, sounds like a mess. Stieglitz shared that they have a "much more ambitious narrative built out for Ark 2," but noted that, bafflingly, "it’s really going to be highly dependent on just how involved Vin Diesel is actually going to be, which is still an open question." 
</p><p>
He goes on to note that they currently do not know how many days, or even hours, they're going to get with the Fast &amp; Furious actor. "The scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do."
</p>
<p>
This, perhaps, is a lesson in not announcing your game with a pre-rendered trailer featuring a very famous and wildly mediocre actor who's too busy feuding with another mediocre actor. I await hearing about the game's next delay in 2029 with little glee, but much anticipation.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will not be returning to iOS in Japan next year "as promised" because, according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, Apple has allegedly launched "another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking".</p>
<p>In a series of messages posted to X/Twitter, Sweeney explained that whilst Apple had been "required to open up iOS to competing stores", it has instead introduced additional fees, including a 21% "junk fee" on third-party in-app payments, 15% for purchases made on the web, and a "new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> earlier this week that it would be making changes to iOS in Japan, including new options for developers to distribute apps and process payments, acknowledging that the changes have been implemented to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).</p>
<p>"Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised," CEO Sweeney wrote. "Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores [on 18th December], and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.</p>
<p>"Apple chose poorly. Again."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, he added: "They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld)." He then linked to a page on <a href="https://t.co/QDtWekKflY">Apple's website</a>.</p><p>"They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors. They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API."</p>
<p>He closed on calling the changes "an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal".</p>
<p>"Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them," Sweeney concluded. "This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission."</p>
<p>It's the latest in the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple in May by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing"</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney has previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>.</p>

			<p>Despite being a very niche genre, fighting games haven't been in a better position, but looking at the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/">games released this year</a></strong>, this wouldn't seem to be the case. <span>With the latest entries in iconic series like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/" target="_blank"><strong>Street Fighter</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank"><strong>Tekken,</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/" target="_blank"><strong>Guilty Gear</strong></a>&nbsp;continuing to receive support with new content and balance changes, there's obviously no reason for CAPCOM, Bandai Namco, and Arc System Works to launch new games.</span></p>



<p>Still, the few fighting games that launched in 2025 are all quality games. Whether you are looking to experience a brand new game or return to a beloved classic, these games have something good to offer you.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Despite being absent from the spotlight for a very long time, SNK's Fatal Fury series continued to be extremely popular among fighting game fans. After a long wait, the series returned this year with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and it couldn't have done so in a better way.</p>



<p>Besides featuring the unique two-plane combat mechanics of past entries, City of the Wolves ups the heat with the new mechanics, such as the Rev mechanics that can enhance special attacks, open up combo possibilities, and more. </p>



<p>With a wealth of single-player modes, including the RPG-like mode Episodes of South Town, a character roster featuring both beloved returning characters and newcomers (including some familiar faces from Street Fighter), Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is rightly considered by many to be the best fighting game released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko">2XKO</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2XKO_KeyArt_YasuoDarius_Final-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Riot's Project L has been a known entity for a long time, but it's only this year that the fighting game community has been able to go hands-on with the project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>now known as 2XKO.</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/">Having only launched on PC in an early access version late this year,</a></span> it's still too early to know if Riot's immense expertise in multiplayer games will be able to make a dent in the popularity of games like Street Fighter 6. Still, it's undeniable that, leveraging the iconic League of Legends cast, the developer is creating a compelling tag-fighter that is easy to get into thanks to simplified execution of special moves, and harder to master with its deep assist system and interwoven offensive and defensive mechanics.</p>



<p>With 2XKO launching next year on consoles, 2026 could definitely be the year for Riot's fighting game. However, even in its current state, the game is more than worthy of anyone's time.</p>



<h2 id="h-absolum">Absolum</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Absolum.png"></a></figure>



<p>Although traditional competitive games are the face of the fighting game genre nowadays, the resurgence of the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre continues at full speed, providing some excellent games, such as Absolum.</p>



<p>Developed by Supamonks and Guard Crush Game, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/"><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></a>, Absolum blends the same combo-oriented gameplay of the SEGA series revival with roguelike mechanics and procedurally generated levels, creating a remarkably satisfying experience with tons of replayability and an immense amount of depth thanks to the masterful crafting of each character's moveset.</p>



<p>While the game may be a little lacking in content right now (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673?l=english"><strong>though more is coming next year</strong></a>), Absolum brings a new spin on a classic formula that works exceptionally well, making it one of the best fighting games released this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Virtua-Fighter-5-REVO-World-Stage.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With fighting games being in a better place than in past console generations, it was baffling to see how SEGA was neglecting the Virtua Fighter series, one of the first franchises to guide the genre's transition from 2D to 3D. Thankfully, the Japanese publisher eventually came to its senses, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/"><strong>a new entry in the series is in the works by the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</strong></a></p>



<p>To bring back the franchise to a new generation of players ahead of the launch of the new game, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage-october-5-debut/"><strong>launched Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</strong></a>, an updated version of the latest entry in the series, complete with a single-player mode incorporating all the gameplay mechanics and tweaks introduced to the base game over the years.</p>



<p>Though not the new entry in the series fans expected, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage is a more than decent release to tide them over for the launch of a new generation game that promises to be the peak of the series.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-2.avif"></a></figure>



<p>Considering the current state of the genre, supporting more than a single fighting game is a real challenge for even big publishers like CAPCOM, which has been exclusively focusing on Street Fighter 6 since its launch in 2023.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the Japanese publisher hasn't completely forgotten about some of its older IPs, such as Capcom vs. SNK and Rival Schools, releasing them to the modern audience with the Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>



<p>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein, Power Stone and its sequel, the two Capcom vs. SNK games, Project Justice, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Capcom Fighting Evolution, the Japanese publisher has made it easier than ever to enjoy these classic games, hopefully with the intent of eventually reviving one of these series with new entries.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As already mentioned, 2025 didn't see the release of many new fighting games, so there are only a few more games worth mentioning. Still, they are more than worthy of a look.</p>

In 17 of the 23 categories, the winner garnered over 40% of the total votes, showing a sense of unity on what you found to be your favorites in 2025. Clair Obscur, as expected by many, ran the gauntlet to win all nine of the categories it was nominated in. Meanwhile, Andor was a huge audience favorite, sweeping all four of the categories around TV. The win by the most narrow margin goes to Predator: Badlands, which took home the win for Best Sci-fi or Fantasy Movie over Frankenstein by only 1.1%, while Blue Prince won by the biggest margin, taking home over 72% of votes in the Best Puzzle Game category. Thank you again to everyone who voted. And now, with big games like GTA 6, Marvel's Wolverine, and other major releases on the horizon, we look forward to seeing how 2026 turns out and learning your favorites this time next year. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Keepin' It Clean</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the year, we have been monitoring those who do not foster a positive experience here at IGN. We remove the most problematic users regularly to improve everyone's overall experience. But we also use this time, before the end of the year, as an opportunity to remove those who were given more time to see if their infractions throughout the year was part of a pattern, or if they were potentially just someone having a bad day or week. So, in addition to recognizing the users who uplifted our community, we have also removed several users who have consistently violated our community guidelines. These banned accounts are those who have engaged in hate speech, harassment, or other toxic behaviors. We know these actions are not always popular, but they are necessary in our commitment to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone at IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we continue to build upon our community, we will continue to monitor and address any problematic behavior to ensure that our community remains a positive and inclusive place for everyone.
