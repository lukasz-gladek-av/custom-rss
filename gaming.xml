<p>A Fortnite artist has hit back at suggestions that some art in Chapter 7 Season 1 is AI-generated, proving their work on a piece of artwork.</p>



<p>Fortnite kicked off Chapter 7 in style with the Zero Point live event, marking the end of the last Chapter, attracting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players</a>, but social media was soon awash with claims that AI created some artwork and assets used in Chapter 7 Season 1, despite a lack of proof.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-artist-proves-their-work-was-not-ai-generated">Fortnite Artist Proves Their Work Was Not AI-Generated</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Proof. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As posted by the likes of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1995684089945620483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HypeX</a>, Fortnite artist Sean Dove revealed he was behind the Marty McFly Spray in the game that some have accused of being created by AI, showing his work on the image.</p>



<p>Dove explained the process of his work, particularly the background featuring clocks, where he “grabbed some clocks off image search, collaged them, and halftoned them.”</p>



<p>He admitted that “the numbers are bad” and that it was “entirely possible” he grabbed an AI clock when gathering images, but, nevertheless, the work was done by him.</p>



<p>Although this doesn’t quite end the AI debate surrounding Fortnite, as there are plenty of accusations revolving around other images found in the game, it does show evidence that one of the most prominent pieces of art, which is available as a Spray in the Battle Pass, is not AI-generated.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Epic Games regarding the accusations of AI artwork being used in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 and is waiting for a response.</p>

                <p>Sony has unveiled a new limited-edition look for the DualSense controller, just in time for the launch of Genshin Impact Version Luna III. Dubbed the Genshin Impact Limited Edition, this controller is inspired by the game and its signature style, giving it a fantasy-themed makeover. Preorders begin December 11 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET, and the controller is priced at $85.</p><p>This version of the DualSense controller combines an ethereal white, gold, and green palette with arcane glyphs found in Genshin Impact. You'll also find emblems of the Traveler Twins Aether and Lumine, as well as a nod to their companion guide, Paimon, with a cute graphic. Sony says that it collaborated closely with Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse to create the controller and celebrate the popular live-service game's fifth anniversary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614873"></a><figcaption>Genshin Impact DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614873-genshin-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614874,1300-4614875,1300-4614876,1300-4614877" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614874-genshin-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614875-genshin-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614876-genshin-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4614877-genshin-5.jpg"></figure><p>The Luna III update for Genshin Impact goes live on December 3, and it introduces new characters, quests, and content to the game.

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>An online co-op mod for very French and very puppety soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has been released in alpha form. As of writing, it'll let you take on boss battles with a friend and its creators are hoping to offer full multplayer playthroughs similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-lets-you-play-the-entire-game-with-a-friend">seamless co-op mod</a> further down the line.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While the multiplayer mods of most FromSoft games are famously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-the-duskbloods-who-needs-them-now-that-dark-souls-seamless-co-op-mod-is-here">the work of modding savant Yui</a>, this Lies of P co-op add-on's been developed by a three person crew called Ember Wave. They've sunk "more than one year of reverse-engineering and systems development" into getting their project to this <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/368?tab=description">alpha release on Nexus Mods</a>, having shown off some progress via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbuROQ5LG5g">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/EmberWaveTeam">Patreon</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As of right now, the mod'll let you jump into boss fights across the base game and DLC - including the likes of the Scrapped Watchman, Nameless Puppet, and Arlecchino the Blood Artist - with one other player. So, duos for the moment, but the modders do note in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/release-mod-144752076">fresh Patreon FAQ</a> that they'll consider upping that limit as they overcome more technical hurdles.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see each other's health bars, spectate your partner via a special death cam if you fall, and be revived if they activate a stargazer. "You can mess around after killing a boss," the modders say, "but crashes might happen."</p><p>As for their next steps towards releasing the full co-op mode that'll allow seamless end-to-end playthroughs, the Ember Wave add that they "still need to sync world events (doors, elevators, quests, etc.) and fix a specific issue related to entering the Hotel, which causes unexpected behavior". So, that's on their plate going forwards, alongside nixing any major issues with the alpha release.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the alpha a go, you'll need to be running Windows 10 or 11 and have a Steam copy of Lies of P running <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1627720/announcements/detail/502836597467646578">September's version 1.12.0.0 update</a>. <a href="https://www.radmin-vpn.com/">Radmin VPN</a> is also required to "simulate a LAN connection" in order to host co-op sessions. Finally, if you want to battle DLC bosses, both players will need to own the DLC in question.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if this co-op mod for the boss battler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn</a> dubbed "the closest we'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC, probably" can hit the complex heights of Yui's masterpieces when it reaches its final form. Until then, the modders'll no doubt keep on pulling marionette strings to see what they can accomplish.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>

<p>The strange statue referenced by Geoff Keighley ahead of The Game Awards 2025 has been the talk of the town, and God of War director Cory Balrog has given a big update on GOW’s status in relation to the statue.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fans have been trying to uncover the identity of a mysterious Game Awards Statue</a>. On November 29, The Game Awards show host and creator Geoff Keighley posted on X saying: “regal.inspiring.thickness.” The message was accompanied by a statue, which was later revealed to be close to the venue.</p>







<p>God of War has been one of the biggest suggestions heading into the show, and Cory Balrog has responded.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Not to be. Image via Santa Monica Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gaming content creator and streamer Luke Stephens had a surprise visitor pop up in their chat during a stream, none other than God of War director Cory Balrog.</p>







<p>Balrog has worked extensively on the GOW franchise since 2005 and worked their way up at Santa Monica Studio, becoming the main director for the 2018 reboot and Ragnarok. Stephens’ chat was talking about the Game Awards statue, and Balrog had a quick message to address one of the many suggested games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“no, it’s not gow.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So there you have it, if you see the statue appear during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> livestream, you might be disappointed to learn that it’s not God of War related.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It doesn’t mean the series will be absent altogether. The long-rumored <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Metroidvania game</a> has been outed for a possible TGA 2025 appearance, and it would be fun to see.</p>



<p>No one seems to know, but what do you think the statue means for The Game Awards 2025? Any ideas which game it’s referring to or highlighting? Let IG know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

<p>Epic Games has significantly nerfed the XP gain across various modes in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, making the grind to complete the Battle Pass much longer.</p>



<p>Fortnite brought an end to Chapter 6 with the huge Zero Point live event, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-7-launch-featured-over-10-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10 million players tuned in</a> to watch the defeat of the Dark Presence, and Chapter 7 Season 1 began soon after—but players have quickly noticed a major reduction in the XP awarded.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-xp-nerfed-for-chapter-7-season-1">Fortnite XP Nerfed For Chapter 7 Season 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nerfed. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on Twitter, FNBRUnderground shared details about the drop in XP gain in the new Chapter, which includes reduced rewards for completing Battle Royale Weekly Quests.</p>



<p>Weekly Quests now provide 134k XP, down from 170k XP in Chapter 6 Season 4, but the biggest drop of all comes in Save The World Endurance, with 188,300 XP available compared to 392,200 XP last season.</p>



<p>Playtime XP in LEGO Fortnite and Creative Maps has also been reduced, with LEGO Fortnite now providing 1,550 XP, down from 2,250, and Creative Maps dishing out 1,750 XP compared to 2,300 XP last season.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not detailed exactly why there has been such a major falloff in XP in Chapter 7 Season 1, but the main theory among players is that it has been reduced due to the longer length of the season, but that doesn’t quite add up.</p>



<p>As revealed by the current Battle Pass, Chapter 7 Season 1 in Fortnite is due to end on March 4, 2026, although this is a Wednesday and could therefore be adjusted slightly to align with Epic Games’ traditional release schedule.</p>



<p>That puts the length of the season at 95 days, which, although longer than Chapter 6 Season 4, the last full-length season in Fortnite, it isn’t too much different, given that the season lasted 85 days.</p>



<p>Fortnite does seem to be offering more quests to complete this season, though, and is encouraging players to jump into a variety of modes by locking some Battle Pass content behind tasks in the likes of Reload.</p>

            <p>Remember that demonic statue The Game Awards host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> plopped in the middle of the Californian desert over the weekend? Well, it continues to raise more questions than answers.</p>
<p>When the statue first appeared, many began to guess what exactly it was teasing. Two of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">most popular suggestions were a Diablo 4 expansion or similar from Blizzard</a>, or a new God of War entry from Sony Santa Monica. However, it now appears to be neither.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion theory was <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1995542966279299507?s=20">ruled out by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who said it was not that, but that it is "a good one".</p>
<p>Ok, well God of War could certainly be considered a 'good one' by many. The last mainline instalment released back in 2022 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which narratively wrapped up the series' Norse saga. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-free-valhalla-dlc">Ragnarök got a free roguelite Valhalla expansion</a>, but what is next for the series now that's all out there?</p><p>Well, if Sony Santa Monica's Cory Barlog is to be believed, whatever is coming next with God of War has nothing to do with Geoff's statue. "Cory Barlog was just in chat on my stream and confirmed this is NOT God of War related," streamer Luke Stephens <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens">shared on social media last night</a>. An accompanying screenshot of the chat in question was also shared alongside the post.</p>
<p>Now, not that I am one to stir the pot, looking at Barlog's comment on the stream, he only says it is not 'GOW' related. Could he be throwing us all a red herring, and is cheekily suggesting that the statue has nothing to do with <em>Gears </em>of War? Hmm… the plot thickens (she says while stirring her pot, fully aware Barlog has nothing to do with Gears of War).</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Other theories yesterday suggested a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, <a href="https://x.com/RohanKarMooN/status/1995579982064885889?s=20">something to do with Housemarque's Saros</a>, or perhaps a new Doom installment. Meanwhile, some have just mused that Geoff has put up a statue to his demonic deity, or something similar. What do you think it could all mean?</p><p>Whatever it does all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>

<p>A Switch 1 vs Switch 2 showdown</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/red-dead-redemption-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Red Dead Redemption</a> has lassoed its way onto Switch 2 today, bringing with it HDR and DLSS support, mouse controls and a smooth 60fps. The big question is, what does all of this look like in practice, and perhaps more importantly, how does it compare to 2023's Switch port?</p>
<p>Here to answer those very questions is the wonderful Felix Sanchez, who has assembled the above side-by-side comparison video to demonstrate how the fresh Switch 2 version fares against its older hybrid counterpart.</p>
<p>The differences are immediately obvious. The improved frame rate is a welcome sight, and textures are greatly improved on the new hardware, too. Of course, there's no hiding the game's 2010 origins, but the Switch 2 version is certainly a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>As a reminder, all those who picked up Red Dead on Switch 1 can upgrade to the new Switch 2 version for free. Otherwise, you'll find the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Red-Dead-Redemption-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2977386.html">eShop</a> for £49.99 (or your regional equivalent).</p>
<p>We'll have our full thoughts on Red Dead's swanky new upgrade with you soon enough, so keep an eye out!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell remake</a> has a new director who's served as its director before. David Grivel has returned to Ubisoft and take up the role he left when he departed the company in 2022, not long after being tapped as the remake's original director following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-have-stealth-announced-a-splinter-cell-remake">late 2021 announcement</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake," Grivel revealed in a recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davidgrivel_today-i-am-very-very-happy-to-announce-activity-7397680267999686656-ZvKU">LinkedIn post</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-3-years-and-a-brief-tenure-on-battlefield-6-former-splinter-cell-remake-game-director-rejoins-ubisoft-for-sam-fishers-big-comeback-a-very-special-team-and-project-to-me/">GamesRadar</a>. "A very special team and project to me."</p>
<p>Grivel's return to the project follows a few years in which he's worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">now-shuttered studio Ridgeline Games</a>, briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto to work on the early stages of an unannounced project, then left to join NetEase-backed studio Worlds Untold. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">Worlds Untold then shut its doors</a> as he was transitioning into has job there, which sounds like a particularly horrible scenario to have faced.</p>
<p>With that road walked, the developer's now back at Ubi Toronto again, having spent 11 years there in the initial stint that ended with his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6985690674448793600/">2022 departure</a> from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> remake. During that time, he worked as a game designer on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry 6</a>, Primal, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>.</p><p>If you're wondering whether Grivel's return will see Ubisoft actually pull the covers off the Splinter Cell remake or provide an update as it how its development's going, the answer seems to be a no, at least for now. Things have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">very quiet on the game's front</a> since that initial 2021 reveal, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">potential teases</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-pandora-tomorrow-is-now-on-steam-but-youll-have-to-deal-with-some-ubisoft-faffage">Steam arrival of Pandora Tomorrow</a> having whipped up hopes. This arguably isn't out of character for a stealty sneakfest, but has left folks keen to splinter their cells without much of an idea how things are shaping up.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that with Grivel now back on board, we might at least get a brief morse code message about the state of the remake sometime soon. Otherwise, it'll be more gazing at Ubisoft from afar through tactical goggles, waiting to see if they pull the trigger on releasing the thing.</p>

            <p>Paramount has another Sonic the Hedgehog film planned, seemingly a spin-off from the main series.</p>
<p>Currently untitled, a Sonic Universe Event Film is planned for release on 22nd December 2028 (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a>). That's over a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">already-announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, which is planned for 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>Nothing else is known about the project at this time, including which character(s) it will star. Is a Shadow the Hedgehog solo film with Keanu Reeves too much to ask?</p>

<p>The first three films in the series have collectively surpassed $1bn at the worldwide box office, with each entry becoming steadily more popular than the last.</p>
<p>It's no wonder, then, that a fourth film has already been greenlit, as well as this newly announced spin-off to expand the franchise further.</p>
<p>It will also follow the Knuckles TV show spin-off, also from Paramount. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-tv-show-has-record-breaking-opening-weekend-on-paramount">set a streaming record for Paramount+</a> on its opening weekend, with over 4m hours streamed. Yet it's hardly the most popular streaming platform and the series itself proved forgettable.</p><p>Last year, Sonic franchise producer Toby Ascher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-films-aiming-to-be-avengers-level-events-says-franchise-producer">described the main films as "Avengers-level events"</a>. He continued: "They're going to be these big, exciting stories that have a lot of different characters. And so what television did for us is it gave us time to go into some of the more supporting characters in depth and really build them out in cool ways."</p>
<p>It's unclear if future TV shows have been scrapped in favour of a feature-length film instead, considering no further shows have been announced following Knuckles.</p>
<p>And if the Sonic Universe Event Film comes after Sonic the Hedgehog 4, will it continue that story or focus on a newly-introduced character?</p>
<p>We don't yet know who will be featured in the next mainline film, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">we've already speculated based on the third film's post-credit scene</a>. Who are you hoping will appear?</p>

			<p>HITMAN: World of Assassination has just received a new update, introducing none other than rap icon and GRAMMY and Academy Award winner Eminem as the latest limited-time Elusive Target mission, available in the game from now through December 31st. This mission is available globally for free starting today as part of the Free Starter Pack, so everyone can get a shot at killing the Slim Shady for good.</p>



<p>As part of an interview <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a> on this update, HITMAN developer IO Interactive practically confirmed that a new game will come at some point, despite the studio currently being busy with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-007-first-light-trailer-shows-off-bonds-stylish-wheels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-confirms-long-rumored-online-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnamed online fantasy roleplaying game</a>. CEO Hakan Abrak said:</p>



<p><em>Of course there will be more HITMAN, but right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year, and next year you’ll get more news about co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next HITMAN.</em></p>



<p>It appears that the hiatus IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-is-on-hiatus-while-ioi-makes-project-007-and-project-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">placed their beloved IP in two and a half years ago</a> has officially come to an end.</p>



<p>In the Variety interview, Abrak also added that 007 is really the only external franchise that IO Interactive would work on, as it fits with their expertise so well:</p>



<p><em>We’ve created other original IPs from the ground up — Bond is actually the only external, licensed IP that we’re working on. And I would say that’s probably the only IP we will work on externally that is not ours. Somehow, it kind of made sense after 25 years of rehearsing for the agent fantasy and doing 007. That was a match made in heaven, you could say. But there’s no doubt HITMAN has been our flagship game, our long love for all the time IO Interactive has existed.</em></p>

<p>007 First Light is scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 27, 2026</a>. Long-time HITMAN fans should, however, know that the studio's next game will be a bit more linear, with clear inspiration from the likes of Naughty Dog's Uncharted.

            <p>Ubisoft's Splinter Cell remake has landed itself a new game director, and it's a name you may recognise.</p>
<p>David Grivel - who left the studio and therefore the Splinter Cell remake back in 2022, to set off for a "new adventure" - has rejoined the project once again.</p>

<p>Sharing the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgrivel/">LinkedIn</a>, Grivel wrote: "I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!"</p>
<p>The developer added this was a "very special team and project" to him, with an accompanying pink love heart emoji.</p>
<p>During his initial stint at Ubisoft, Grivel worked on the likes of Far Cry and the Assassin's Creed series. Following his departure from the company three years ago, Grivel then moved to EA's Ridgeline Games to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">Ridgeline was subsequently shut down in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>As for the Splinter Cell remake, well we still haven't seen a huge amount of the upcoming game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>Perhaps now Grivel is back on the job once more, we will get a fresh Splinter Cell remake update soon? Stay tuned.</p>

He was the Lead Architect of the PlayStation Vita, PS4, and PS5 — you might remember him from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;rco=1">PS5 Pro reveal</a> — and he appears on the most recent episode of Simon Parkin's <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console">My Perfect Console</a> podcast where guests pick five games to immortalise on their very own fictional console.</p>
<p>As you might expect, there's plenty of Sony chat in there, but that didn't stop a little slice of unexpected Nintendo discussion slipping in there, too. As it turns out, Cerny is a bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> fan at heart, and if that isn't something all of us <em>capital-G</em> <em>Gamers</em> can agree on, then we don't know what is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0ixrypj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Olimar's escapades cropped up as Cerny described playing the first game as a "transformative" experience. "That first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure," Cerny told Parkin, remembering the game's "emotionally involving story" of Olimar's attempts to return home.</p>
<p>Here's the full quote, so you can read his thoughts for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I had this thing where I tended to play smaller, lighter games for about 10 years, so I don't know, Portal or Plants vs Zombies or Flower or Katamari Damacy. Pikmin I just pick out of that list because I thought it was such an emotionally involving story. Poor Captain Olimar, he crash lands and he's got 30 days to reassemble his ship or he'll run out of oxygen and die and he's sending letters home every day.</p>
<p>"And for me that was just transformative. I mean, I guess I'm a sucker when it comes to story, right? But then for Pikmin 2, it's totally different. So they're on Earth, they're running around picking up trash on Earth. That's the storyline, if you recall. Literally, you're running around somebody's bathroom floor in Pikmin 2. And in one of those, you're running from debt collectors, if I have that right.</p>
<p>"But that first Pikmin, yeah, that's one I just treasure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cerny has had strong connections with various studios throughout his career (he designed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> at Atari and worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_sonic_the_hedgehog_2">Sonic 2</a> after helping to establish Sega Technical Institute). The games we associate with this industry figure would likely have more of a PlayStation flavour these days, though, so it's nice to see Pikmin sneaking into his top five. Those delightful little sprouts are the ultimate gaming unifier, eh?</p>
<p>You'll have to listen to the full podcast episode (now on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/sg/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi">Spotify</a>, and all the usual places) to hear Cerny's complete 'Perfect Console' picks, and hey, that's not a bad way to spend an evening.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Splinter Cell Remake Was Given Back to Its Original Game Director]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-splinter-cell-remake-was-given-back-to-its-original-game-director/</link>
            <guid>1370050</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly four years since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the rumors and officially announced they were working on a Splinter Cell remake. The following day, the publisher also <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-helmed-farcry-6-lead-game-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> some of the key members of the project's development team, including its Game Director, David Grivel.</p>



<p>Grivel, an industry veteran, was the Game Designer of Crysis 2 before moving to Ubisoft, where he worked on Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, Assassin's Creed Unity, and, more recently, on two Far Cry games: the prehistoric spin-off (Primal) and the latest mainline installment (Far Cry 6).</p>



<p>Grivel didn't last long in the role, initially leaving in October 2022 to join DICE as Senior Design Director for Battlefield 6. He then briefly returned to Ubisoft Toronto in May 2024 as Game Director for an unannounced project in the concept phase, but left again in December 2024 to join Mac Walters at <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a>. This new NetEase-funded developer was, however, quickly shut down when NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled its support in late 2024</a>. </p>



<p>This year, David Grivel worked as a remote consultant on the upcoming cyberpunk action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-action-rpg-neo-berlin-2087-new-gamescom-2025-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEO BERLIN 2087</a>. However, last week, he announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7397680267999686656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;that he had&nbsp;rejoined the Splinter Cell remake project, once again as its Game Director.</p>



<p>Supposedly, he'll help bring the project over the finishing line. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier rumors</a>, Ubisoft should be targeting a 2026 launch for the Snowdrop Engine-powered remake. The same source, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson, later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he saw the game and that it looked impressive. </p>



<p>We don't really know much about the game's details. A job description <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Ubisoft was looking to 'rewrite and update' the story for a modern audience, although it is unclear whether that direction was maintained amidst the shuffling of directors.</p>



<p>Still, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful return of Solid Snake with the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3</a>, fans of stealth action games will definitely be happy to see his old frenemy Sam Fisher coming back, too. Moreover, the Splinter Cell Remake could be the third big remake of a classic Ubisoft title to launch in 2026, following Prince of Persia: Sands of Time (<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly due next month</a>) and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemingly set for a March 2026 release</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s not often that any game gets a new peak player count years after release, and it’s even rarer when it happens to a driving simulation title <strong>thirteen years </strong>after hitting the market. That’s what happened recently with Euro Truck Simulator 2, which skyrocketed on Steam to reach a new peak player count years after its release in October 2012.</p>



<p>On Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2 soared to 72,678 concurrent players, all because of two new DLC packs that took players to the Nordics.</p>







<h2 id="h-euro-truck-simulator-2-reaches-new-heights">Euro Truck Simulator 2 Reaches New Heights</h2>



<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 has always been one of the most popular driving sims, with some players going to extreme lengths to replicate a truck cab in their gaming room to immerse themselves in the hyper-realistic driving experience fully.</p>



<p>Days ago, SCS Software released two new pieces of DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2, Nordic Horizons and the Forest Machinery expansion. The former takes players to the gorgeous, rural vistas of Scandinavia, presenting them with mountainside roads, forest tracks, and scenic drives around lakes and fjords.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the expansion:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>SCS Software has made leaps and bounds with Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, constantly adding new locations and ways to explore the game through a staggering array of expansions.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, users can invest in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 <strong>Ultimate Edition bundle </strong>to secure the base game and a whopping 34 expansions and pieces of DLC. This includes Greece, France, Italy, the Balkans, and of course, Scandinavia.</p>



<p>The game has remained a consistent hit since 2012, generating ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews to make Euro Truck Simulator 2 one of the top-rated titles on Steam.</p>

<p>Ninja has been streaming ARC Raiders since the game came out, participating in the recent ‘streamer war’ and exploring every facet of the all-new extraction adventure from Embark Studios. The game has proven to be a monumental success, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers from across the streaming space.</p>



<p>The popular creator, with origins in games like Fortnite, revealed the one thing that he thinks would <strong>ruin </strong>ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-don-t-make-arc-raiders-competitive">Don’t Make ARC Raiders Competitive</h2>



<p>During a recent stream, Ninja stressed that making ARC Raiders competitive and introducing tournaments would make the game unbearable, simply because people would start ‘min-maxing’ to sweat the game and become the best they could be at it.</p>



<p>Right now, it’s the most casual extraction title on the market, boasting accessible mechanics, a socially-focused gameplay loop, and forgiving combat elements.</p>



<p>Ninja’s concern is that if you add tournaments and the ability to earn money from playing ARC Raiders at a ‘pro level’, you’ll destroy those elements and just make the game too challenging for casual players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nah, the second they try to make this game competitive, it would be so bad. I hope there are never tournaments for it.</p>



<p>I want them to keep it as casual as possible.</p>



<p>Also, there’s too much desync for this game to legitimately be competitive. They better never make this game competitive, ever.</p>



<p>Even like, joke tournaments. Like Escape from Tarkov has tournaments and stuff, I don’t know how they work, but like… The second you start throwing money in this game, people are going to start competing and it just encourages people to just min-max and become the best at this game, and…</p>



<p>It rapidly increases how quickly people get good at games when you start throwing tournaments in, it’s what happened to Fortnite.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full clip:</p>

<p>Players appreciate how approachable ARC Raiders is compared to other extraction titles, and while there’s definitely a skill gap, it feels like every weapon and approach is viable when it comes to combat. Introducing a strict meta and pushing for a competitive or ranked loop might push out the more casual players who are enjoying this game because of that fact.</p>



<p>That being said, Embark Studios also developed The Finals, a competitive arena shooter title with a more traditional ranked loop that includes high-stakes tournaments. It’s unlikely that any official tournaments would surface in ARC Raiders while the team is focused on making The Finals a competitive, esports-backed product.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/switch-2-exclusive-drag-x-drive-scores-its-second-major-update-heres-whats-included</link>
            <guid>1370029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>The Switch 2 and eShop exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has today received a new game update, bumping it up to Version 1.2.0.</p>
<p>This follows an update in September and comes loaded with general updates (such as adding the chasing game Survival Tag to multiple modes) and multiple fixes. It also makes some changes to Drag x Drive: Global Jam. It's been renamed the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-demos-list-every-switch-2-game-with-an-eshop-demo-available">Drag x Drive Demo</a></strong> and certain bot games can be played at any time.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Drag x Drive - Version 1.2.0 (Released 1st December, 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>General Updates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the chasing game Survival Tag to friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: To play Survival Tag when in the parks listed above, the player who created the park opens the X Menu, then selects <strong>Start Survival Tag</strong> on the Players tab.</li>
<li>Depending on the wireless environment, there may be times where player positioning does not perfectly match between users. For that reason, there may be cases where, even if it appears to one player as if contact was made, from the other player’s perspective no contact occurred. In order to limit unpleasant experiences in situations like these as much as possible, in basketball games this may be determined as no contact.</li>
<li>On the other hand, in Survival Tag, the question of contact is the whole crux of the game and is particularly important to game progression. Therefore, it has been designed such that a tag is considered successful if there was contact from either perspective (the tagging player, or the one who was tagged).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corrected the calculation of Iso Wins on the Game Stats tab under Stats. Previously, it counted the total number of Isos, not just wins.</li>
<li>Added Rope Jumps to Other Stats tab under Stats.</li>
<li>Changed the target of the Focus Cam when near the sumo ring to the sumo ring itself.</li>
<li>Made some adjustments to bots in friend parks, local wireless parks, and LAN parks.
<ul>
<li>Note: We slightly lowered the strength level of the Easy and Standard bots that the player who created the park can add under the Players tab of the X Menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a feature to enable players to delete their own records.
<ul>
<li>On the screen that displays players’ records before starting time trials or shooting contests, simultaneously press and hold the ZL Button, left directional button, and right directional button on the Joy-Con 2 (L) for 10 seconds to delete the record.</li>
<li>Once deleted, records cannot be restored.</li>
<li>Obtained trophies will remain, even if records are deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a very rare issue where, due to unintended behavior, the displays for level or total distance would reach the upper limit.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue in Circuit Sprint where players sometimes passed through terrain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bunny hops made it possible to accelerate to and maintain speed that exceeded top speed.
<ul>
<li>The intended design is that it is only possible to accelerate beyond the normal top speed when driving down a slope or successfully pulling off a halfpipe or ramp trick. However, unintended behavior occurred, such as players accelerating beyond top speed when landing after rotating, or not decelerating while in midair even if they had exceeded top speed. We fixed this because this issue required players to control their character in unintuitive ways in order to achieve good results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Version 1.1.1 for the <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em> (formerly <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em>) was also released.</p>
<p><strong>General Updates (Demo)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed software title from <em>Drag x Drive: Global Jam</em> to <em>Drag x Drive Demo</em>.</li>
<li>Changed the software icon that displays in locations such as the HOME Menu.</li>
<li>Made it possible to play the tutorial and certain bot games any time.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues to create a smoother gaming experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find out more about the existing update in our previous post. And if you want to learn more about this demo, check out our Nintendo Life review. Here's what we had to say in our written review, and you can check out our video version at the top of this page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima Joins Zootopia 2 Cast Days Before Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/</link>
            <guid>1370026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been revealed that Hideo Kojima, the legendary game creator, has joined the cast of Zootopia 2 to provide a Japanese dub for Paul Moldebrandt, a mole who works in the Zootopia Police Department. His cameo appearance reportedly comes after he was directly approached by Jared Bush, the film’s director, to request his voiceover talents.</p>



<p>Zootopia 2 is set to hit screens in just a few days, launching on Friday, December 5.</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unexpected-cameo">An Unexpected Cameo</h2>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recorded by Famitsu</a>, Hideo Kojima expressed his delight at being invited to voice a character in Zootopia 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have plenty of experience with cameo appearances in live-action films and games, but this will be my first time dubbing an animated feature film. And it’s from Disney, to my surprise!</p>



<p>And since it came directly from director Jared Bush, I was incredibly honored and accepted without hesitation</p>



<p>My participation was limited to a small scene, but even at the recording stage, the level of detail was impressive. Thanks to the illustrations, the recording went smoothly. I’m usually on the directing side, so I learned a lot from actually acting. I was reminded of how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning pages in the script and adding noise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As Kojima said, this isn’t his first time acting. He has appeared in a few small roles over the years, most notably in Cyberpunk 2077 and Control. He also assumed roles in Metal Gear Solid games and has made cameos in Death Stranding.</p>



<p>The report from Famitsu suggests that Kojima was a huge fan of the first Zootopia movie, released in 2016, and when he saw it, he was left wondering how they could ‘surpass’ it with a sequel.</p>







<p>Do you plan to watch the Japanese version of Zootopia 2 just to catch Kojima’s cameo? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="dbf01f2788a01"><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dbf01f2788a01/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't already got a Switch 2 and happen to be located in the US, the bundle deal including a download copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has gone on sale for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>This bundle deal is currently available at Amazon, Walmart, Target and Best Buy for <strong>$449</strong> instead of the usual $499, so you're saving $50. This is the first time the bundle has been on sale in this location and gives you access to the new entry in the Mario Kart series at no extra cost (instead of having to fork out extra).</p>
<p>A regular Switch 2 bundle is normally priced at $449, so this current offer on the Mario Kart World bundle brings it down to the same price. Nintendo also previously mentioned how the Mario World Bundle would be a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-will-be-a-limited-time-offer">"limited time production" through to Fall 2025</a> in the US and is available "while supplies last".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 has only recently passed the six-month mark in its life, and Nintendo has not officially discounted or reduced the price of the new unit, so this latest offer might be worth considering if you were hoping to save some coin.</p>

This model includes the new Shield Remote, offering backlit buttons, a built-in microphone for voice commands, and even a lost remote locator feature (so you'll know exactly which cushion it slipped behind). The main attraction, however, is the box itself, which features some nice hardware. Here's a quick look at its specs:</p><ul><li>Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor (256-core GPU and 3GB RAM)</li><li>16GB storage (expandable)</li><li>AI-upscaling for 4K 60fps</li><li>Dolby Atmos support</li><li>Dolby Vision support</li><li>Gigabit Ethernet port</li><li>HDMI 2.0</li><li>2x USB 3.0 Ports (Type A)</li><li>Android 11 with Chromecast 4K built-in</li></ul><p>For gaming, you'll have access to Google Play Games and GeForce Now. That makes this a pretty cool central entertainment hub, offering you a chance to stream not just TV shows and movies, but also games.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you like the concept of the Nvidia Shield TV Pro but want to save a few extra bucks, take a peek at its more affordable sibling--the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Streaming-Performance-Assistant-945-13430-2500-000/dp/B07YP94PBJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia Shield TV</a>. It comes with a similar Nvidia Tegra X1+ processor, though it's equipped with 2GB RAM instead of 3GB. You'll also lose out on the USB 3.0 ports and see a drop from 16GB of storage to just 8GB. However, at $125 (was $150), it might be a good choice for frugal shoppers.</p><p>Another cloud gaming option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gaming-Bundle-including-streaming-Controller/dp/B0CLPDXQ8Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max + Luna Controller Bundle</a>, which is on sale for $70 (was $130) at Amazon. The Luna Controller is surprisingly great--especially when streaming with Luna--as it helps reduce input latency and is quite comfortable for extended gaming sessions. Note that these Fire TV Sticks all support Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>If you're not interested in cloud gaming, you can save even more by opting for a media streamer device without the gaming capabilities. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-newest-AI-powered-Search-million/dp/B0F7Z4QZTT?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Plus</a> is just $25 (was $50), while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> is $35 (was $60). Both obviously support 4K output, but the Max gets you an additional 8GB of storage, features the Alexa Voice Remote Enhanced, and offers the Fire TV Ambient Experience when you're not actively streaming.

Amazon has it listed for one of its best prices of the year right now, and since the customizable speaker also serves as an alarm clock and white noise machine, it's a fun purchase at $70 (was $90). Amazon's discount started on Black Friday and continues through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Cyber Monday</a>; however, the Cyber Monday event ends at 11:59 PM PT on December 1, so you have just a few more hours to cash in on this offer.</p><div title="6536568 - Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5150" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536568 - Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker (BF2025)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen/dp/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen\/dp\/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen/dp/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen/dp/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen\/dp\/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Bluetooth-Speaker-Controlled-Screen/dp/B07YWWYK86?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$70 (was $90)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><span>Available in five different styles (all of which are on sale), the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker is quite popular with buyers. Sitting with nearly 11,000 reviews on Amazon, it's holding down an impressive 4.6 stars. Along with serving as a Bluetooth speaker, you can customize the pixel art on its display using the attached mini keypad. There's also a companion app where you can quickly adjust your settings--or download artwork from other users. So even if you're not the most artistic person on the planet, you can still get a fun design for the speaker.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>For playing music, you can connect via Bluetooth, USB, or microSD card. Beyond looking adorably retro and blasting tunes, the device also works as a white noise machine, a timer, and an alarm clock with 12 wake-up sounds. And since it gets around 8 hours of battery life on a charge, you can use it throughout your home before needing to plug in at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4613206" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4613206"></a><figcaption>Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speakers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4613206-mixcollage-28-nov-2025-11-36-am-9119.jpg"></figure><p>The same company responsible for the Retro Pixel Art Bluetooth Speaker also makes a few other cool speakers. A cheaper alternative is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FRFDY837?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic Gaming PC Style Speaker</a>, which is just $56 (was $70). It's designed to look like (surprise!) a retro computer, though its display isn't designed for pixel art. Instead, you can use it as a digital picture frame. There's also the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Divoom-Timebox-Portable-Bluetooth-Programmable/dp/B07H7L1PLD?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TimeBox Evo</a>, which offers a similar pixel grid as that of the Retro Pixel Art Speaker, but it's housed inside a minimalist black frame. It's available for $38.20 (was $70).</p><p>Looking for a Bluetooth speaker that's a bit more traditional? The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Max-Alexa-Speaker-Graphite-Amazon/dp/B0D6SX8VLQ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Dot Max</a> is on sale for $90 (was $100), and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Echo Dot</a> is just $32 (was $50). The former features a built-in 0.8-inch tweeter and 2.5-inch woofer, while the latter comes with a 1.73-inch front-firing speaker. The Echo Dot Max is a better choice for large spaces, though the affordable Echo Dot will work just fine for a home office or bedroom.</p><p>Be sure to also check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday Deals Hub</a> to see even more discounts available before the sale ends.</p><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upgrade-nintendo-switch-2-storage-with-steeply-discounted-samsung-512gb-microsd-express/1100-6530578/">Last Chance To Get Cyber Monday Deals On MicroSD Express Cards For Switch 2</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controllers-on-sale-for-black-friday/1100-6536412/">DualSense Limited Edition PS5 Controllers On Sale For Black Friday</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-black-friday-game-deals-available-now/1100-6535728/">Check Out Over 200 Nintendo Switch Game Deals For Black Friday</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-switch-exclusive-game-deals/1100-6536453/">Eight Nintendo Switch Exclusives Are 50% Off In Walmart's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>
