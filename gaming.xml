<figure><a title="Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/45577cb8ff836/pac-man-world-2-re-pac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not one to be disappointed often, especially with Directs. Yes, even Partner Showcases — some of the <em>best</em> Directs have been these third-party lead ones, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKB3WXRWTCM&amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica">June 2022's Mini Partner Showcase</a> ranking pretty highly for me.</p>
<p>Today's Partner Showcase was not one of those, which maybe hit a little harder because this was our first Direct post-Switch 2's launch.</p>
<p>It feels like we're in a new era for Nintendo, where release dates and brand new games can just randomly pop up on a news app, and the Switch 2 is now getting day-and-date ports like Bloober's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>; a cool little surprise for you horror fans out there. This Partner Showcase felt like it was ushering in that era.</p>
<p>But, for anyone watching who was maybe on the fence on buying Nintendo's shiny new console, this probably wasn't the Direct for you. I'm not sure if Partner Showcases have <em>ever</em> been targeted at people without the console, given that they focus on multiplatform releases, but when your console is brand new and you need a hook for people? This perhaps wasn't the greatest lineup.</p>
<figure><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7195e7845c5d8/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I did make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-partner-direct-predictions-what-do-you-expect-to-see">one wild prediction</a> that was <em>never</em> going to happen (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a>, my beloved), I'm more than a little shocked that we still have a ton of games shown off during the April Direct that don't have release dates.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, despite getting rated in June, is still MIA on Switch 2; a date would've lit the bonfires, or Sites of Grace, I guess. Instead, we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a>, which looks cute and, importantly (for Nintendo, at least), uses GameChat and other Switch 2 exclusive features. But it's not a headliner, is it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, all of these games are sitting with a vague "2025" or "Winter" date, and they remain untouched (I think Silksong news is a Gamescom lock-in, though, given that it's playable there).</p>
<p>One of the games that did show up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. I thought for sure we'd get a date for that, but nope, still just "Winter". The trailer felt like a little poke, a reminder that the game exists. But hey, at least we saw a Champion's face <em>and</em> got a glimpse at a new construct.</p>

<p>I promise it wasn't all mediocre for me. My favourite game of the show should be pretty obvious to those who know me; it's a Square Enix HD-2D game, but not the one that <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-nos-predictions-pour-le-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-du-31-juillet-60313">was rumoured to be showing up</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the name, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> looks <em>lovely</em> and is exactly where I wanted Team Asano to go with HD-2D; not just a remake, something a little different, and an action RPG. It gives me a little bit of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a> vibe — multiple weapon types that you can upgrade, a small open world... Oh, and there's couch co-op! You know I've already downloaded the demo.</p>
<p>Sticking with Square Enix, I was worried <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> was going to be a port of <strong>Champions of the Continent</strong>, the mobile game. It's not, as Square Enix confirmed in <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/nintendo-direct-31-july-2025">a blog post</a>, and instead uses the mobile game as a base. And good lord, there's <em>town</em> building? Help me. And, as a little bonus, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a> upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Romancing SaGa 2</a>'s remake also gives me a good reason to finally play this one.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> is at last coming to a Nintendo console — it's a fantastic remake and, whether you've played FES or Portable or never touched the game at all, is well worth grabbing. I'm always happy to see a new Katamari game on Switch, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> looks delightful. And, while I've never played a game in this series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> looks pretty darn good, too.</p>
<p>If we were a year or two into the new console's life, I think this'd be a pretty solid Direct. Not earth-shattering, but a nice little cherry on top of the foundation already built. But we're not. We're not even two months in. So it's hard not to feel a little deflated.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because we're in a time when having multiple consoles is more common; my Switch 2 is, of course, my main platform right now, but I've already played Persona 3 Reload and I already own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> on PS4. Again, both great additions to the new system, and I know there's a bunch of people who want to play these games afresh or have yet to play them. Though the steady trickle of Game-Key Card confirmations for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2</a>, Octopath Traveler 0, and a few others seems to be dampening the mood.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's more-powerful specs, even when games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> looked a little rough, open the floodgates for a more mainstream suite of ports, like a feature-rich <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a>, and like Cronos. This is probably the new normal, so we're going to have to get used to it.</p>
<p>But even if you had modest expectations like me, I think many will feel a bit let down with today's showcase, particularly us early Switch 2 adopters. Fortunately, we've got plenty to look forward to — even if the very best stuff still doesn't have a release date. Honestly, Nintendo, how can you stick Hyrule Warriors in a Direct and not even give us a date...? Or a month?</p>
<p>I'm sure a full-fat Nintendo Direct, or even an Indie World later in the year, will be enough to satiate. But for now, I'm left wanting a little more from my new console.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-threatened-edward-kenway-actor-with-a-lawsuit-after-he-teased-an-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-black-flag-remake-is-on-the-way.1258728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the end of June, amid a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/">myriad of rumors</a> already circling about an incoming remake of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, the actor who played Edward Kenway, Matt Ryan, <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-practically-confirmed-by-edward-kenways-actor/">practically confirmed</a> that the remake was real and that it was coming soon. Ubisoft took notice and, according to Ryan, wasn't too pleased with his apparent slip-up and threatened the actor with a lawsuit.</p>



<p>Ryan admitted to the legal threat while signing the box of a fan's Edward Kenway figure at a recent convention. First posted to TikTok by kylo_hd659, and then shared on <a href="https://x.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618">Twitter by TheHiddenOneAC</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/">Insider-Gaming</a>), Ryan is asked by the fan about his comments and about the upcoming remaster, to which he first responds by shrugging and saying, "<em>Don't know</em>."</p>



<p>The fan presses him further, and Ryan explains, "<em>Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this *gestures to person filming,* and I was being very free and open. But I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone, and then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that, as Ryan explained, he wasn't aware he was being filmed at the time. Sure, you can argue that he shouldn't have said anything if he didn't want the trouble from Ubisoft, but there's also an argument to be made that Ubisoft is being a bit overly litigious here. </p>



<p>Ubisoft's own co-founder and chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/">confirmed in June 2024</a> that there were remakes of Assassin's Creed games coming. Anyone who knows anything about the Assassin's Creed franchise knows that Ubisoft and its decision-making executives would be dumber than they already seem to be at times, if they weren't working on a remake of Black Flag. Ubisoft has also been in dire need of some good press around its projects and what it has coming down the pipeline. </p>



<p>It honestly seems like a waste of a day for Ubisoft's lawyers to write up the legal threat in the first place. Surely they had better things to do with their time, and a simple message from someone on Ubisoft's team who works directly with actors like Ryan, telling him to stop talking about the remake and referencing it, would have sufficed. </p>



<p>But then again, we can't exactly be too surprised about a video game company being overly litigious, nor can we be surprised about a mismanagement of time and resources at Ubisoft.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-just-won-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-again.1258725/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic has won again. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will not overturn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">the unanimous jury verdict from 2023</a> that Google’s app store and payments system had become illegal monopolies. Today, a three-judge panel affirmed the lower court’s decision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23945184/epic-v-google-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-trial-updates">in Epic v. Google</a>, according to an full opinion you can read at the bottom of this story — and Google will now appeal again, the company confirms to <em>The Verge</em>. It could be appealed to the Supreme Court next.</p><p>Judge M. Margaret McKeown begins her opinion for the panel:</p><div><blockquote><p>In the world of adrenaline-fueled survival that epitomizes the video game Fortnite, winners are decided in blazes of destruction and glory. By contrast, the outcome of this case—centered on Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and the Google Android platform—turns on longstanding principles of trial procedure, antitrust, and injunctive remedies.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>“Total victory in the Epic v Google appeal!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950962683387261359">tweets Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>.</p></div><p>Google will appeal: “This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem. Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal,” writes Google global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland in a statement shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>But it appears that the Google Play Store may <em>not</em> be protected from the consequences of its monopoly while Google appeals — it might need to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">start cracking open Android for third-party stores</a> the way that Judge James Donato ruled in his permanent injunction back in 2024. Last October, Donato <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24271996/google-epic-lawsuit-play-third-party-app-store-changes-delayed-administrative-stay-granted">pressed pause on all but one specific piece of his ruling</a> while Google appealed, but today, Judge McKeown writes “The stay motion on appeal is denied as moot in light of our decision.”</p><p>We’ve asked Epic and Google to clarify. For what it’s worth, the Ninth Circuit says today that every part of the permanent injunction is valid. “We uphold the injunction in full.”</p><p>Epic does seem to think that Google can’t stop it as of today: “Thanks to the verdict, the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store!” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1950968220833423451">Sweeney tweeted</a>.</p><p>But the consequences of the full permanent injunction would stretch far beyond a single game: they would force Google to effectively open up its app store to competition for three whole years. Google would have to distribute rival app stores <em>within</em> the Google Play store, give rivals access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, and it would be banned from a variety of anticompetitive practices including a requirement that apps use Google Play Billing. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">You can read a summary of the details here</a>.</p><p>Epic originally sued both Google and Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal">in 2020</a> over the removal of its hit game <em>Fortnite </em>from both stores, though the case was more complicated than that. Epic intentionally used <em>Fortnite</em> as a wedge to challenge the app store monopolies, and in the case of Apple, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling">it mostly lost.</a></p><p>The appeals court did recognize Epic’s gambit today, writing that “Google removed Fortnite from the Play Store after Epic embedded secret code into the app’s software” that bypassed Google’s payment systems. (Epic has never denied it.)</p><p>But Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case, we saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">when attending the trial in person and reading all the receipts</a>. A jury saw secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and game developers. The jury saw internal emails between Google execs that suggested Google was scared of how Epic might convince its fellow game developers to join or create rival app stores, creating unwanted competition for Google. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24003500/epic-v-google-loss-apple-win-fortnite-trial-monopoly">Here are a few thoughts</a> about why Epic won against Google, but not Apple.</p><p>Today, the Ninth Circuit rejected the idea that the decision in the Apple case should impact the Google case, at least in terms of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949223/google-is-opening-the-trial-with-market-definition">all-important</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2023/11/27/23978562/market-definition-epics-expert-suggests-its-the-difference-between-movie-theaters-and-televisions">question</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23978280/the-epic-v-google-economists-are-here-to-argue-market-definition">market definition</a>, aka “can Google really have a monopoly on Android apps if it’s competing against Apple?”</p><p>“The market definition question was neither identical to the issue in this case nor litigated and decided in Apple,” McKeown writes, adding that the “commercial realities are different”:</p><div><blockquote><p>Apple’s “walled garden” is, as the district court in Apple noted, markedly different from Google’s “open distribution” approach […] Google admits as much, noting that “Android’s open philosophy offers users and developers wider choices” than iOS does, even as that openness “limit[s] Google’s ability to directly protect users from encountering malware and security threats when they download apps.” As a consequence of its business model, Apple does not license iOS to other OEMs in the way that Google licenses Android to Samsung, Motorola, and other smartphone manufacturers.</p></blockquote></div><p>She also uses McDonalds and Chick-fil-A to make a point that markets can overlap:</p><div><blockquote><p>McDonald’s might compete against Chick-fil-A in the fast- food market yet not compete against Chick-fil-A in the <em>hamburger </em>fast-food market (and instead compete with Wendy’s, Burger King, Sonic, and In-N-Out Burger. Although Google and Apple compete for mobile-gaming downloads and mobile-gaming in-app transactions, they do not compete in the Android-only app distribution and in-app billing markets.</p></blockquote></div><p>Those two markets, Android app distribution and in-app billing, are where a jury unanimously decided that Google has a monopoly.</p><p><em>Developing… we’re adding more to this story now, refresh in a few minutes for more.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a> is coming to Switch 2 only, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</a> is lined up for both Switch 1 and 2 - and Square Enix has confirmed there'll be no way to upgrade a Switch 1 version of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/square-enix-games.com/post/3lvbhnvp7ys2m">Posting on Bluesky</a>, the publisher says that if you buy the Switch 1 version, you won't be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version via an Upgrade Pack. This means Switch 2 owners wanting a physical copy of the game will be stuck between Switch 1 cart they can't upgrade and a Game-Key Card which — according to the official box art — will require a 5GB download.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvjqum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Note about the Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch versions 1/2]<br>
The Switch 2 versions (both the physical and digital versions) can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2.<br>
[2/2]<br>
It is not possible to upgrade from the Switch version to the Switch 2 version once purchased. There are also no plans for an option to upgrade to the Switch 2 version in future. Please make sure you purchase the correct version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other publishers have offered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-upgrade-packs-and-free-performance-updates">Upgrade Packs</a> that let anyone with the Switch 1 game get the upgraded version of the game on the more powerful console but, for whatever reason, Square apparently has no interest in offering this as an option.</p>
<p>As a reminder for anybody out of the loop, Nintendo introduced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Cards</a> as an option for publishers on Switch 2. They don't contain any game data, with the cart acting — as the name suggests — as a key that must be inserted in the console, first to download the entire game from the eShop, and subsequently to access the game on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While this means that publishers can get a 'physical' product on store shelves and you have something to put on your own shelf (or resell, if you like), you'll still need to have the game downloaded and taking up storage space on your system - and you'll need the card inserted to play it.</p>
<p>Players' reaction to Game-Key Cards from players has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">largely negative</a>, although the option to get a physical copy of the Switch 1 game and then get the digital-only Upgrade Pack for Switch 2 was a compromise some were prepared to make. Zero chance of that here, it seems.</p>
<p>The game's not out until December, so it's possible plans could change. "Please make sure you purchase the correct version" doesn't sound promising, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Robo-Link, activate?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Nintendo Partner Direct, we got a new trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. While most of the trailer was straightforward, it ended on a cryptic tease that has Zelda fans running with speculation as to what the scene could mean for the game's roster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the trailer shows a chamber deep inside a cavern where what appears to be one of the Constructs from Tears of the Kingdom is being assembled and activated. The Constructs themselves are nothing new - they're all over the place in Tears of the Kingdom, and we know they were created by Mineru during the events of Age of Imprisonment, so it makes sense we'd see them in the game. What's interesting about this one is that it appears to be roughly human-shaped and -sized, whereas none of the Constructs we've met before (including Mineru's own Construct) were quite that proportioned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why are fans excited about this? Well, a lot of folks think this means <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeLink/comments/1me38a5/how_are_we_feeling_about_construct_link_x_zelda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we're getting some sort of Robo-Link playable in Age of Imprisonment</a>. The game takes place in the far, far distant past, thousands of years before the main events of Tears of the Kingdom, and in the time period that Zelda is transported to at the start of that game. It covers the events of the Imprisoning War as Zelda experienced it during her time in that era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, chronologically, it doesn't make any sense that Link would be playable in Age of Imprisonment. There was no Link in that era, after all. That said, it also seems baffling that a Legend of Zelda game, even a spin-off, could exist without Link involved. This is why a lot of fans have been speculating that Link will find some way to turn up, whether that's through alternate timeline shenanigans (see: Age of Calamity) or some other method. And this teaser offers one possibility for this hoped-for Linkening: maybe Link somehow gets to embody one of Mineru's constructs made in his likeness, so he can fight alongside the others of that era.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">nintendo you know i dont play about fi please dont play with me <a href="https://t.co/Uj0QOJQ9aj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Uj0QOJQ9aj</a></p>— ava (@zeldevil) <a href="https://twitter.com/zeldevil/status/1950913028670787672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there's one other detail that has fans thinking this is going in a different direction. If you listen back to the ending teaser, there's a bit of music that plays as the scene transitions to the Construct. If you're a Skyward Sword fan, you'll recognize it as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV1Efuh-aus" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fi's Theme</a>. The presence of this little chime has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me1h85/aoi_new_age_of_imprisonment_trailer_in_nintendo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some suspecting that this won't be a Robo Link</a>, but actually a way for Fi to finally reappear in a Zelda game after being (understandably) absent for so long. Some are suggesting this could be possible given that Zelda obtains the broken Master Sword at the start of her time in the ancient era. Given that Fi dwells within the sword, what if they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1me2vii/totk_rise_up_because_we_are_so_back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">used its fragments to give her a body to fight with</a>? Anything's possible!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that means it's also possible this thing is none of the above and we're in for some sort of weird twist surprise when the game comes out. Age of Calamity, after all, wasn't quiiiite what we thought it was by the endgame, so it's likely Age of Imprisonment also has some tricks up its sleeve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We unfortunately still don't have a firm release date for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment but know it's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 sometime this winter. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at today's Nintendo Partner Direct right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase might have featured a new Plants vs Zombies remake, Monster Hunter Stories 3 and a pair of new Square Enix HD-2D titles, but there was one game conspicuous by its absence. Again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> fans tuning in were left disappointed by yet another video game showcase passing with no further word of Team Cherry's highly-anticipated, long-awaited sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And to be fair to the fans, there was cause to think today might finally bring Silksong's much-desired release date. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Nintendo Direct earlier this year confirmed the game would arrive in 2025</a>, raising hopes of a fresh appearance today. And, just days ago, Microsoft announced that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">Silksong will be playable via a fresh Xbox demo</a> in a couple of weeks at Gamescom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid this backdrop, hopes were high — but, as we now know, they were in vain. Reaction to the Nintendo Direct on the Hollow Knight and Silksong subreddits has, perhaps to be expected, not been positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The top thread currently on the Silksong <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1me1j9k/aaahahahahahahah/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> is a meme of a cat laughing open-mouthed, pointing at the screen. "It's never been so over", "The cycle of pain", "Silksong isn't real" read a selection of the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've genuinely lost so much hype for this game," wrote reddit user YeetHead10. "I was so excited last year but now I've just moved on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"No you havent," replied DirtySlutMuffin. "You're here complaining."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At least this is consistent in my life," CringeNaeNaeBaby2 said, referring to the constant disappointment around Silksong they faced. "You know when they go to jail, spend years trying to get out, then beg to be readmitted after being freed? I'm gonna beg for Silksong to be unreleased. I need the longing, the spite keeps me alive. I'm gonna drop dead when Silksong comes out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans simply seem upset at their own frustration, though a few have suggested Silksong developer Team Cherry should be doing more to set expecations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like people would be taking it better if Team Cherry themselves gave more frequent updates," wrote reddit user ChocoGoodness, "instead of letting us wait for Nintendo or Xbox or whatever to announce it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, all we know of Silksong's arrival is that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-developer-responds-to-release-date-confusion-promises-launch-before-holiday-not-tied-to-xbox-handheld-arrival">will launch before Christmas 2025, and not be tied to the release of the ROG Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything that <em>was </em>shown today, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of the Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.

                <p>If Nintendo of America had its way, Pikachu could have been given "huge breasts" and Pokemon would have "kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical," according to a recently unearthed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180731153121/https:/www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0007/taidan1/page03.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The interview is from around the launch of Pokemon Gold and Silver and is between Nintendo and The Pokemon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who still serves as the company's president and CEO today.

<p dir="ltr">Nintendo of America staff then shared some of their own, alternate Pokemon character designs. The designs were apparently so traumatic that Ishihara said he "won't show those illustrations to anyone as long as I live."</p><p dir="ltr">"They kind of looked like the characters from the Cats musical," Ishihara said. "So, for example, Pikachu was changed into a character shaped like a kind of tabby cat with huge breasts."</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the interview, Ishihara is asked to clarify what the design looked like, and if it looked similar to when women dress up like Pikachu at anime conventions.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, exactly," Ishihara said, seemingly clearing up any potential confusion. "They presented that kind of design to us for real. I thought it was interesting, in a sense of appreciating such cultural differences. However, I didn't want to compete in the [overseas] market with that kind of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon, of course, would go on to be released overseas with relatively few changes from the original Japanese version, creating a multi-media juggernaut that still continues today. It feels fairly safe to assume that might not have been the case had Pokemon all been anthropomorphized animals with big boobs. After all, that's Digimon's thing.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Pokemon news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">Pokemon TCG Pocket recently removed two instances of plagiarized art</a> in its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-introduces-200-new-cards-including-johto-starters/1100-6533412/" data-ref-id="1100-6533412">Wisdom of the Sea and Sky expansion</a>, and is now conducting an "investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game."

<p>And it's got a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a survival horror fan, you've probably been keeping an eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a brand new sci-fi third-person shooter where you jump between 1980's Poland and a dystopian future. Previews for the game dropped earlier this week for other platforms, and they seem solid across the board.</p>
<p>Luckily, Switch 2 owners don't need to miss out on the scares, as the game was confirmed to be coming to the new Nintendo console on the same day as other platforms; <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Developed by Bloober Team, the studio behind last year's critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Cronos puts you in the suit of The Traveller who live in a world post "Change", a cataclysm that turned many humans into 'Orphans', monsters who now prowl across the world.</p>
<p>Traveller's job is to jump back in time to the '80s and extract the souls of those who were transformed during the apocalyptic event. Gunplay and combat is thoughtful and you can't just shoot your way through every encounter — even if you want to when a terrifying monster is approaching you.</p>

<p>This was probably the biggest surprise of the Direct for us — a game that's already pretty established getting a Switch 2 version <em>and</em> release date, the same day as other consoles? That's a shock we're willing to accept.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team's 2021 psychological horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-medium-silence-of-the-damned/">The Medium</a> is being adapted into a film by Gary Dauberman, the man who horror fans will recognize as the writer and producer of the recent <em>It</em> and <em>Annabelle</em> films.</p>



<p>Dauberman won't be writing on the project himself, as he is currently in the process of looking for a writer and director to helm the film. Dauberman's production company, Coin Operated, which he runs along with the company's president, Mia Maniscalco, will be producing the film.</p>



<p>Dauberman told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gary-dauberman-spooky-video-game-the-medium-exclusive-1236333819/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, who first reported the news of the adaptation, that "<em>With its compelling story and incredibly cinematic visuals, </em><em>The Medium</em> is a natural for a feature film adaptation. When I talked to Piotr [Babieno] about it, we immediately connected on our mutual love of horror and his vision for where the genre is headed. I have no doubt anything Bloober develops is going to push horror forward in unique and terrifying ways, and I’m excited to be working alongside them."</p>



<p>For Bloober Team's part, chief executive officer Piotr Babieno added, "<em>Adapting games into films often involves balancing many interests, but with </em><em>The Medium</em>, I have a deep sense that Gary is the perfect partner for us. From our very first conversation, I felt we were completely in sync. And every conversation since has only reinforced that feeling."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this film. Dauberman most recently worked on the adaptation of Until Dawn, which, by most accounts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/until-dawn/">did not impress audiences</a>. Whoever he gets to work on this adaptation as a writer and director will, of course, likely be the make-or-break element of this film.</p>



<p>The other interesting aspect about this adaptation news is that it brings into question what's happening with the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-the-medium-tv-series-the-witcher-producer/">TV series adaptation</a> of The Medium. The assumption, now that this film adaptation has been announced, is that nothing is happening with that series, and that it's another of dozens of projects that are born and die before they ever get close to audiences in the regular Hollywood churn. </p>



<p>Or perhaps we'll see the TV series be born again after this film with a different angle. Or maybe we'll see neither, as this film adaptation could see the same end the TV series did.</p>

Even though they confidently take a Rathalos fireball to the face in their introductory cutscene, Lagiacrus is weak to Fire. They also differ from other water monsters in that they’re not weak to Thunder, and instead use Thunder element attacks. All that to say, <strong>Fire-based weapons and Thunder-resistant armor will go a long way here</strong>.</p><p>I’ve had the most luck when keeping a +20 Thunder resistance. This hunt isn’t as bad as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>’s almost endless lightning strikes, but more than half of the attacks are electric. Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough. </p><p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a></span>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p><p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p><p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p><figure id="" data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat. While there is free movement and access to the Evade button, you’ll mainly be fighting with your slinger. You can use it to drop Submerged Rubble, collect Piercing Pods, or directly latch onto Lagiacrus in a similar interaction to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">Mounting</a></span>. The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p><p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p><p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks. I’ve seen great results using the Rey Dau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351">Gamma armor</a></span> that’s forged from fighting Arch-Tempered Rey Dau. On top of the included high Thunder Resistance, it offers many other useful skills for both offense and defense. Throw in some Evade Window and Partbreaker decorations to give yourself a real fighting chance.</p><h2 id="h806430"><a id=""></a>Lagiacrus’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The only thing better than defeating the “Lord of the Seas” is all the parts you get after.

The thickness of the wood, how you stack the wood in the fire, and the timing are also very important, and sometimes you just need to sit back and wait for a while. This quiet back-and-forth with nature will draw you in…and when the fire finally roars to life, the sense of accomplishment you’ll feel is more satisfying than any high score could ever be.</p><p>You can enjoy the game solo at your own pace, or gather around the fire online with friends and family using GameChat or GameShare. Camera feeds appear around the fire, making it feel like you’re truly together in the same place. You can work together to build a fire, or compete with your own firepits. There’s a variety of different playstyles waiting for you. In addition, there’s a built-in “Campfire Convo” feature which helps keep the chat exciting.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Even if you have no experience building a campfire, you can still have fun playing with confidence. Players that are new to campfires are encouraged to explore the game’s hidden depth. For experience campers, these features can be turned off, for a more demanding and refined challenge. In a world that’s always rushing, reclaim the simple joy of just watching a fire.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Nintendo Direct: July 31, 2025 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Chillin' by the Fire – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="チルっと焚き火ソン [Nintendo Direct ソフトメーカーラインナップ&nbsp;2025.7.31]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q8SasBNe79I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/campfire-simulation-game-chillin-by-the-fire-announced-for-switch-2-now-available]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've ever fired up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and wondering why the likes of Shadowheart or Lae'zel's portrait shows them glaring at you like they've been summoned into some kind of video call, I bring good news. Larian's rectified this and one other infamous issue as part of the game's latest hotfix.</p>
<p>Don't get too excited, though. The devs are so keen to make sure no one gets their hopes up for any more major additions to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now that its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees">final patch</a> is out of the way that they've dubbed this a "room temperature fix".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538855872766412727?l=english">notes</a>, you'll find plenty of useful stuff, such as a fix that should stop modders being timed out when trying to upload beefy works. There's also some documentation in legalese for you to dissect over a cup of tea in the form of <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">updated</a> <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/bg3-fan-content-terms/">rundowns</a> of Larian's policies when it comes to fan-made content.</p>
<p>But enough of that, to the headliners! "Told the Dark Urge, everyone's favourite amnesiac, to stop talking about people 'back home' (you don't know where that is yet, bestie) and spoiling the game by mentioning their 'father', among other silly notions, in their overhead dialogues," reads one tweak.</p> <div>

<p>If you're none the wiser, cough cough Baldur's Gate 3 spoilers ahead cough cough, the Durge wouldn't stop alluding to who their dad was, and it's someone whose name begins with the sound a sheep makes.</p>
<p>Speaking of dads, Larian reckon this hotfix should finally deal with character sidebar portraits sometimes being replaced by shots of the character's model just standing there like you've rung your older family members.

            <p>Punishing my tendency to never bother watching Nintendo Directs, Bandai Namco used today's Switch 2-focused showcase to announce <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-upon-a-katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a>: the first mainline, non-remake Katamari game since 2011. It’ll be out on PC as well, come October 24th 2025, and while you’ll once again be rolling up entire societies around a swelling sticky ball, this one will span a range of time periods - so you’ll be able to knead whole new planets out of feudal Japan or ancient Greece.</p>

<p>As is tradition, dating back to 2004’s original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, said rolling will be on behalf of godlike space-monarch and perennial fuckup The King of All Cosmos, whose latest oopsie has re-destroyed the Earth for what must be his fifth or sixth time now. Though it looks like the historical eras you’ll be rolling up are all Earth-based too, so you’re presumably building a replacement planet out of itself, which the King will then ruin in the future, and will need to built out of itself again, and so on, for infinity. Nice bit of timelooping existential horror for this child-friendly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a>, there.</p>
<p>Other touches of newness include the ability to customise your lil' rolling person’s appearance, an original, likely catchy soundtrack, and most pertinently to your rolling endeavours, a powerup system that can make for faster or more precise detritus-bundling. In the trailer we see a range-extending magnet, rocket boosters, and the power to stop TIME ITSELF.</p>
<p>I admit to not having played any Katamari games on PC, much of my series experience coming in the form of bleary-eyed New Year’s Day sessions on consoles belonging to whichever old college friend had just let me sleep on their floor. But Windows has seen a few of the remakes in recent years, with Liam (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-22-favourite-games-of-2023-so-far">loving</a> 2023’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/we-love-katamari-reroll-royal-reverie">We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie</a> in particular.

<p>Available in Coral Red and Translucent Black, the Elves 2 is a different proposition from its 'Pro' variant, (which is already available - you can check out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gulikit-elves-2-pro-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-small-yet-refined-saturn-tribute">full review for all the details</a>). The new model is missing a few key features, such as APG recording and custom thumbstick sensitivity, but it's still got gyro support, three levels of rumble intensity, and those all-important Hall Effect analogue sticks with removable caps.</p>
<p>The Elves 2 is priced at $29.99 and is available from Amazon now in the US and Japan, with Europe to follow "soon". Select global retailers will also offer the pad, though pricing may vary depending on region.</p>
<p>"We’re proud to be the first controller brand globally to support wake-up functionality on the Switch 2 at launch," said Gulikit in its press release.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the pad's key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Retro-Inspired Ergonomics:</strong><br>
Shaped after the Sega Genesis controller for comfortable, fatigue-free play. Compact and lightweight for gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong>- World-First Switch 2 Wake-Up Support:<br></strong>Instantly wake up your Switch 2 from sleep mode—GuliKit is the first controller brand to offer this feature out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>- Dual Hall Effect Joysticks:<br></strong>Drift-free performance with 2200-level high precision and long-lasting durability.</p>
<p><strong>- Advanced Haptics with Asymmetric Dual-Rotor Motors:</strong><strong><br></strong>Three levels of responsive vibration feedback for immersive gameplay, similar to Xbox's tactile feel.</p>
<p><strong>- Universal Compatibility:<br></strong>Works seamlessly with Switch 2, Switch, Windows, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p><strong>- Classic Floating D-Pad:<br></strong>Perfect for fighting games, with precise actuation and fast combo execution.</p>
<p><strong>- Pro-Level Input:<br></strong> Tactile triggers and silent conductive rubber buttons for fast, responsive, and comfortable control.</p>
<p><strong>- Wired &amp; Wireless Modes:<br></strong>Choose between Bluetooth (730Hz polling rate) or wired (1000Hz) connections for ultra-low latency.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Regarding archetype progression, consumables are the new introduction to help players earn XP for their archetypes outside of playing matches or skill games, and to help players who didn't jump into FC 26 on day one and start building their clubs right away catch up to those who did. You'll unlock consumables through season pass and objective rewards, or through the Clubs Store. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And while there will be multiple kinds of consumables available, some of the ones EA is introducing are Archetype XP multipliers and Direct Apply AXP, both of which boost AXP either through match rewards or just a direct boost. Archetype unlocks are exactly what they sound like, letting you unlock any of the remaining 12 archetypes you didn't pick when you first jump into clubs, and the same goes with Archetype Resets, which let you reset your attribute points and redistribute them.</p>

<p>FC 26 also introduces signature perks, which, according to EA, "<em>encourage you to embody your chosen archetype or specialization whenever you step onto the pitch</em>." Every archetype comes with two perks that you unlock through archetype progression, and a third can be applied when you have a specialization active.</p>



<p>Some perks are action-focused, which means they're based around you performing specific actions on the pitch, while others are mechanic or team-based. Mechanic perks focus on improving elements of your game, like your passing, while team-based perks improve how your computer-controlled teammates receive passes and control the ball.</p>



<p>Live events coming to Clubs are one of the other major changes in FC 26, with new events coming to Clubs regularly through single-elimination knockout rush tournaments. That said, you do have multiple attempts to make it out of the first round if you lose a match when starting a rush tournament. You're truly eliminated when you lose each attempt.</p>

<p>Some of the rush tournaments will have house rules like Rugby Rush, which is basically a 'no fouls' mode, or a Designated Scorer mode, where goals only count if they come from a designated player.</p>



<p>Players can now also be a member of up to three clubs at a time, switching between them at will through the Clubs menu, but that doesn't mean you'll earn rewards for all three when playing a match for one of them. So make sure you have the right club selected if you're trying to earn rewards for a specific one.</p>



<p>The big promise with this year's entry into EA's long-running football series has been to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/"><em>make gameplay better</em>,</a>" and address the myriad of issues that players have had with the game for years. It's clear that EA is putting in some kind of effort from these deep dives and its marketing, but whether it's all sizzle and no steak is something we won't know until FC 26 launches on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on September 26, 2025.</p>

Square Enix have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, a prequel to the genteel 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-pc-review">hailed</a> as... "a bit of a slog"?? "A big old anticlimax"??? I thought it was quite good!</p>
<p>This is an outrage! I'm going to tell Katharine she sucks at writing and is terrible at video games. What do you mean, she doesn't work here any more? Well in that case, I'm going to tell Graham he should never have hired her. What do you mean, he doesn't work here any more? Who <em>does</em> work here any more? Oh screw it, just roll the trailer.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> Nought takes place in the first game's Orsterra, a medieval fantasy confection with a few Steam Age flourishes, and sports the same "HD-2D" visual direction - a calculatingly throwback  blend of chintzy sprites and lushly illuminated 3D environments, much like a grandfather clock equipped with a wifi speaker.</p>
<p>It brings back the first game's battle system, which saw you Breaking (aka, staggering) enemies by filling a bar, and spending Boost points to enhance actions performed in each turn. Characters still get unique Path Actions when interacting with townsfolk, too. 
</p>
<p>
So where does it differ? Well, you can now customise your protagonist and rebuild your very own hometown, Wishvale, after somebody inconsiderately burns it down in the prologue. It's not yet clear how this might affect the rest of the game, but I imagine you'll be able to shop in Wishvale and give your party members places to live. It's what I'd do, if I were Enix, Esquire.
</p>
<p>
Octopath Traveler Nada launches on December 4th this year. That dirty, no-good Katharine also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/octopath-traveler-2-review">reviewed the second game</a> before she left us languishing in the arms of Ian Games. She remained unimpressed, concluding that "bar a couple of very minor evolutions, this is effectively the same Octopath Traveler as before". I confess, the first game's story does drag on, but I greatly enjoyed the alchemy of the Boost and Break systems. I do think Square Enix have run the HD-2D look into the ground at this point, though.

Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p><p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p><p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p><p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p><figure id="" data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

But if you venture over to the indie side of gaming, you’ll find genuine gems. One such is <em>RimWorld</em>. It’s a story-generator, according to its creator, Tynan Sylvester, in which the pawns you control and your choices create the ongoing tale. With the launch of the game’s latest expansion, <em>Odyssey</em>, introducing gravships, additional biomes, new animals, and more quests and rewards to uncover, it’s an excellent time to delve into <em>RimWorld</em>. I may be biased as I’ve spent nearly 700 hours with the game.

Before that, it was relatively niche, but still popular in a cult following sort of way, thanks to <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. It’s not about an overarching story; it’s about the tales you craft in the moment. In <em>RimWorld</em>, intelligent AI storytellers, like Randy Random, alter the experience based on how you’re faring in the moment. If you’re doing too well, with abundant food and resources, you might soon endure a horde of man-eating chinchillas ravaging your base and its crops. It’s all part of the experience.</p><p>This randomness is why most people who enjoy <em>RimWorld</em> really enjoy <em>RimWorld</em>. They don’t play for ten or twenty hours; they play for <em>thousands </em>of hours. They want to see what’s going to happen in the next episode of cannibal colony meets <em>The Sims</em>!</p><p>To give you an idea of what can happen in a colony, here’s an excerpt from a review I wrote on Steam about the game, which I think perfectly encapsulates the <em>RimWorld </em>experience:</p><p>“I started an ice sheet challenge with a single colonist. Thanks to the abundance of mods, my colonist soon discovered a talking tree in the wastes. His mind was forever altered. It wasn’t long before the kindly Lafayette was muttering to himself and chanting in odd tongues. He began to worship Cthulu in the mountains - alone and with supplies dwindling. It mattered not. The old god required sustenance of his own. Raiders came to pillage; none survived. They were placed upon the sacrifice table and offered to the tentacled one.”</p><h2 id="h819209"><a id=""></a>New player tips to help you avoid a colony crisis</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re a new player who recently picked up <em>RimWorld </em>on sale, I’m sorry.

While the default game speed isn’t overwhelmingly zippy, there’s a lot of map to explore, including under-mountain areas, colonists to manage, animals to hunt, and monsters to flee from. Your attention will be pulled in ten different directions simultaneously every few seconds, so pause to give yourself some breathing room.</li><li><strong>Defend your colony to the death</strong>. Upon crash-landing planetside, there are a few necessities to consider first: food, shelter, and safety. These three pillars are paramount to your colony’s success, but so many new players overlook safety. They think building in a mountain like a dwarf secures their existence. It doesn’t. You’ll want to consider traps, sandbags, etc.</li><li><strong>Build for efficiency, not aesthetics</strong>. Once you’re more experienced, then you’ll start designing bases that incorporate vibes or whatever Reddit says these days. For now, focus on efficiency. Wood burns, granite doesn’t. Your refrigerator and kitchen may remain in the same room to eliminate wasted time. Your Research Bench isn’t like other workbenches, in that it requires a sterile room to boost your colonists’ research rate, so separate it from the rest of the rabble.</li></ul><p>I could go on endlessly, but these tips will start you off strong.</p><h2 id="h819210"><a id=""></a>A look at <em>RimWorld</em>’s wild side: modding</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>RimWorld </em>draws in tens of thousands of players daily and has an all-time peak player count of over 62,000.

To find these Whispers, certain detective Glimmers like Mickey Mouse, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde will need to lend their expertise to the cause.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were given a look at a few of the Zootopia cards that will be part of Whispers in the Well, including Judy Hopps - Uncovering Clues, Nick WIlde - Persistent Investigator, and Putting It All Together.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[Editor's Note: Minor spoilers for Dead Reset ahead.]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cole Mason has a problem. He’s woken up in a dank cellar of a room, surrounded by people he doesn’t know and under circumstances he doesn't recall. They are all very unpleasant and really need him to perform a high-stakes surgery as soon as possible under threat of a swift execution at the hands of extra-ornery security guard named Slade. I was given a few choices upfront, mostly to attempt to resist being forced to cooperate. Early attempts to run and refuse are met with pretty convincing pushback, so Cole ultimately plays ball and helps them with the surgery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that's when things get weird. The patient is revealed to have a pretty dramatic, pulsating tumor in her abdomen, and after Cole’s understandable recoil of disgust, he gets to cutting. Pulling back the skin reveals a sort of living tumor that she certainly wasn’t born with. Before he can attempt to extract it, though, Cole is grabbed by one of its tentacles, and we’re given a choice as to how to deal with it: hack away at the rubbery limb or attempt to calm down and let it ease up on its own. It doesn’t really matter which choice you make, as both moves have a similar outcome of the tumor bursting from the patient’s body, revealing its mangled alien form of meat and mouth, and killing everyone in the room in gruesome fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dead Reset Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then things get really weird, as Cole wakes up on the floor he started on, startled by the fact that not only is he not dead, but he’s the only person who remembers the past several minutes of their lives together. What ensues is a tense, quirky, and clever horror sci-fi experience that does a great job at building suspense with  limited set and effects budgets, and a cast of actors taking the Russian Doll meets Alien premise seriously, despite being a hard sell on paper.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dead Reset’s commitment to real actors with real props on real sets is such a refreshing sight that feels novel both in video games and in film in general in 2025.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You could argue that horror games that are more like interactive films peaked in quality with 2015’s Until Dawn, but there’s been a steady drip of them hitting market places thanks almost entirely to developer Supermassive Games and the work they’ve done since Until Dawn with The Dark Pictures anthology and other little releases here and there. And while those virtual slash fests are fun and give artists some flexibility on how they can render a gnarly monster or a brutal death of some unfortunate camper by its hands, Dead Reset’s commitment to real actors with real props on real sets is such a refreshing sight that feels novel both in video games and in film in general in 2025. Does every prop live up to Tom Sevini’s best? Probably not. But the SyFy tv show chic and the audacity to do it at all is what scored the most points for me so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice-making parts of these sorts of games can be dubious, though. It’s often tough to know in the moment if a choice you’re making would change the outcome of a scenario, or if it's all an elaborate set of smoke and mirrors to build tension in the present at the expense of replayability in the future. Developer Dark Rift Horror signals that there are multiple endings, each wildly different from one another, and the one-hour demo of the first chapter is absolutely not enough to determine if that's true or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The death-loop gimmick does a lot of work to help every present moment feel important, though. Every respawn, Cole (and I) got a little smarter based on our last set of attempts and failures that would sometimes reveal just a smidge more new information to be exploited next time. Cole can’t delay the surgery because the creature will let itself out rather explosively. Attempting to steal Slade’s gun and force your way out of the room reveals that it's got a security measure that Cole will certainly regret triggering if he tries to use it. Magson, the older leader of this gang of misfits, made this and other modifications to the room that essentially locked everyone in it without their knowledge. The patient’s name is Amanda, and Fearne, another crew member in the room, has some sort of relationship with her. These tidbits add up to become a laundry list of facts that helps Cole convince the crew that he’s in a sort of Groundhog Day scenario that maybe they can help him navigate in a way that doesn’t involve all of them getting murdered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these seemed pretty guided in that I could make different choices, but there isn’t much room to interpret that any of the smaller details would happen differently, or even in a different order. But all of this gets us to the surgery itself, which was the first glimpse of how the paths could branch into different outcomes further down the line. This is a bit of a spoiler, but going into a bit of detail about how this sequence plays out might help illustrate the ways in which your choices do and don’t matter. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The patient is revealed to have a pretty dramatic, pulsating tumor in her abdomen, and after your understandable recoil of disgust, you get to cutting.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can guide Cole through the extraction of the creature in a couple of ways, specifically choosing how to keep it sedated long enough to detach it from Amanda without killing them both. You can use drugs to keep the patient and the creature’s vitals low but steady, or you can stop Amanda’s heart, which would also stop the creature’s temporarily. Ultimately, I wasn’t able to find (and don’t believe there is) a way to save Amanda during this operation, but how you choose to attempt it will either ingratiate you with Fearne or draw some light praise from Slade. It seemed pretty clear here that this was the beginning of a sort of trust system that could hold some consequences down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things in Dead Reset get somehow even weirder after this, but I think it’s best to avoid those spoilers, as they’re pretty key to what’s going on and why, but the suspense is thick and intrigue is high during its entire runtime. Real bodies on real sets with real stunts and props is a philosophy sorely missed in film these days, so it's ironic that a video game is attempting to bring that feeling back. The game-ness of it all, specifically necessity and weight of your limited inputs, is still pretty dubious, with little sense of how your actions affect the story in front of you. But if you’re willing to approach this like you would a movie, being present and acting in the now without thinking too much about finding branching paths for your next playthrough, I think you can have a lot of gore-drenched fun when Dead Reset hits Steam in September.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-reset-combines-alien-with-russian-doll-type-choice-driven-gameplay]]></content:encoded>
