That’s just the case with this custom <strong>Scuf Instinct Pro</strong> controller in a black tiger camo finish, which is on a clearance sale at <a href="https://howl.me/cmP1ZZtANRW">Best Buy</a> for $155.99 ($84 off).</p><p>The Instinct Pro is an excellent step-up controller over the standard Xbox gamepad, as it’s nearly the same great controller with some nice upgrades. It supports the wireless connectivity built into Xbox Series X / S consoles and of course can be used on PC — just like the stock controller — but it also features four rear paddle buttons built into the chassis of the gamepad and lockouts for the shoulder buttons that give them a mouse-click hair trigger feel.</p><p>What you’re not getting with the Scuf is Hall effect sticks, so it’s possible the right or left analog stick may drift over time after many hours of use, but it’s frankly the same risk you run on Microsoft’s similarly-priced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Series 2</a> controller. There have been more drift-proof controllers slowly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">cropping up over time from third-parties</a>, but outside of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23981792/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-xbox-pc-wireless-controller-antidrift-announcement-price">few exceptions</a> most are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799149/gamesir-g7-se-xbox-windows-hall-effect-drift-free-controller-price">wired only</a>.</p><div><p>Scuf’s Instinct Pro is its top-tier controller for Xbox consoles and PC. It is the only third-party wireless option around, and for its very high price, you get rubberized grips, built-in mappable rear paddle buttons, hair-trigger locks, swappable sticks, and user-configurable cosmetics.</p></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Spaceship likers, come hither. Long-running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space sim</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elite-dangerous">Elite Dangerous</a> has just unloaded a new interstellar vessel into its universe, and she's a beaut. The new Type-8 Transporter is a medium freighter capable of hauling a maximum of 406 tons of cargo. It's got a default jump range of 17.55 light years and two big prongs sticking out of its face like a sci-fi forklift. Cool. The catch is that this ship can only be bought with real money for now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/359320/view/4363510595754651475">say the developers</a>. This is part of Frontier's new strategy of having paid-for ships in the game. I don't really play Elite Dangerous anymore, so I don't have strong feelings about that. But I do have strong feelings about the space trucker advertisement the developer has put together for the new ship. Come watch it with me.</p>

<p>Ah, that was good. No action. No shooting aliens. No drama. Just a man and his space truck on the open space road, occasionally accompanied by the presence of large letters. LOAD MORE. God, yes. DELIVER FIRST. Maybe I will!</p>
<p>As for the ship's design, some fans have playfully made fun of the fact that the ship looks a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a>'s ubiquitous mining ship, <a href="https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Venture">the Venture</a>, simply flipped upside down and given a few slinky angles. And while some similarities do exist, it is not as close in design terms as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>'s equivalent space truck, <a href="https://starcitizen.tools/Vulture">the Vulture</a>. Whatever the inspirational source, it looks good in my book. I will not complain about the big yellow starmobile.</p>
<p>But some players might, as it currently costs about £10 in real-world money (via the special in-game currency, Arx). It's not the first time Frontier has charged for a spaceship - the <a href="https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Python_Mk_II">Python Mk II</a> came out in May for the same price, also locked behind that special currency. Previous to that, players saw all spaceships added to the game as free updates. Any irritation about this might now be soothed, however, seeing as that Python MK II was made buyable with normal in-game credits yesterday. The same staggered release is planned for the trucker's delight pictured above. In November it'll be on the "open market" for all players. </p>
<p>Ship manufacturing in Elite Dangerous has been slow in recent years. This year has seen the first new ships since 2018. Which helps to explain some of the frustration players may feel when they get excited about this asteroid miner's dreamboat, only to realise it costs money now. For me, I'm satisfied just to watch the advert and soak up the atmosphere of blue collar space work reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blasphemous-devs-reveal-cryptic-teaser-for-fall-2024-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/BlasphemousGame/status/1821516844248776904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the official Blasphemous account revealed a mysterious new teaser for some kind of content coming in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>The teaser doesn’t feature any gameplay, instead featuring the brief cinematic of a single cryptic object. This leaves fans to speculate on its purpose, with many comparing it to the Mea Culpa and how that could tie into the existing lore.</p>



<p>The post says that “the bells toll again, Penitent One,” and that “your patience has been a virtue, but you need not wait for much longer.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This may hint at potential DLC for Blasphemous 2, possibly adding new gameplay and features. Developer The Game Kitchen first launched Blasphemous 2 in August 2023. </p>



<p>So, it’s fitting to announce something new this month, and there has been enough room for the developers to work on fresh content. </p>



<p>Blasphemous: Stir of Dawn, the first major DLC for the original game, released about a year after Blasphemous. </p>



<p>That DLC introduced a variety of new content, including new enemies, bosses, areas, and features. It also added New Game+, a highly requested feature. Stir of Dawn was also a free update for all players. </p>



<p>Blasphemous 2 could receive similar DLC in Fall 2024, but the teaser doesn’t reveal much. At this time, The Game Kitchen did not confirm anything concrete except the release window.</p>

                <p>A new patch went live for Destiny 2 this week, and alongside the usual balance changes, a "generous" buff to the drop rate of Exotic class items had fans excited. <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_2_update_805" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bungie</a>, the chances for acquiring Exotic class items from chests found in the Overthrow activity have been adjusted.

		<p>The first reviews for the Borderlands movie have dropped, and critics have not held back in their critiques of this latest video game adaptation, describing it as “<a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/borderlands/">a&nbsp;botched Guardians wannabe</a>” and that it comes with “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-b2592670.html">wildly miscast actors and an impenetrable script</a>“.</p>
<p>Borderlands releases in cinemas this week, from today (8th August) in the UK and from tomorrow (9th August) in the US.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands (2024) Final Trailer – Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jack Black" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Icnysn53neU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s just a few dissenting voices in these early critic reviews, which has left the film with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/borderlands/critic-reviews/">a Metacritic rating of just 33</a>, and it seems that any real positivity stems from Cate Blanchett’s performance as Lillith. “Blanchett knows exactly what movie she’s in, and she seems to be having the time of her life,” said <a href="https://screenrant.com/borderlands-movie-review/">ScreenRant</a> on the way to the 7/10 highest score, while <a href="https://collider.com/borderlands-movie-review/">Collider</a> gave it a 5/10 and called it “a fun ride, but a bloated cast and breakneck pacing don’t allow it to reach its full potential.”</p>
<p>And it’s the potential that other critics felt let down by. <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-eli-roth-1236098894/">Variety</a> cited the film’s predictability and a “tamer-than-expected take” on the game series,&nbsp;<a href="https://bleedingcool.com/movies/borderlands-review-imax-action-karen/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">BleedingCool</a> said there are “No emotional depths, stakes, or convoluted plot worth speaking of,” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-movie-review-generic-and-disposable/1900-6418265/">GameSpot</a> said, “that’s what happens sometimes when a movie spends four years in post-production being repeatedly reworked–over time, everything gets sanded down into nothingness.”</p>

<p>There’s plenty more reviews out there, but almost all of them lay into the long-in-production film.</p>
<p>The film was in development for a good few years and was announced way a back in 2015. Eli Roth was in the director’s chair for the Borderlands movie, his filmography includes the likes of Cabin Fever, the Hostel films, The Green Inferno, Death Wish, and The House with a Clock in its Walls.&nbsp;The film was completed some time ago, but Tim Mller was brought on board to reshoot some scenes.</p>
<p>The cast includes Jamie Lee Curtis as Tannis, Cate Blanchett as Lilith, Ariana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Jack Black as Claptrap, Kevin Hart as Roland, Edgar Ramirez as Deukalian Atlas, the Founder and CEO of the Atlas Corporation, and Florian Munteanu as Krieg.</p>

<p>Nexon and Embark Studios have announced the intention to publish both The Finals and ARC Raiders in China in association with Tencent. It’s expected that this will raise ‘China only’ servers for both games, with both titles being ‘specifically customised to appeal to millions of players in China’.</p>



<p>Tencent is typically the go-to publishing partner for anyone looking to launch games in China.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-trending">Trending</h2>



<p>This information was revealed in <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/k9D3/z5PY/dcAp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nexon’s quarterly earnings report</a>, which confirmed that the company had a solid few months. Results exceeded expectations, with the highest numbers having been driven by the launch of Dungeon &amp; Fighter Mobile in China. </p>



<p>While The Finals remains a solid pillar for Nexon, the report stated that ‘ongoing adjustments’ are being made to improve player retention, which has been an issue in the game for some time.</p>



<p>Soon, Nexon and Embark Studios will bring The Finals to China, via Tencent. This will be through a customised version of the game that’s built to accommodate a Chinese audience. Recently, Ubisoft confirmed that both Rainbow Six Siege and Rainbow Six Mobile were clear to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-china/">deployed officially in China</a>, also through a partnership with Tencent.</p>



<p>When it’s eventually released, ARC Raiders will also make an appearance in China. This third-person extraction shooter has a solid premise but not too much of it has been seen aside from some leaked playtest footage.</p>

Imo Kaufman, a PHD student at the University of Nottingham who has been conducting research in collaboration with the National Videogame Museum, sought to unpack the term at during another breakneck Hyper Talk at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">AMAZE Sheffield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking to the stage for just five minutes, Kaufman explains she wants to unpack the identity and experiences that surround the term–for both players and developers. "My research is about oral history, which means I interview people about what they think about and feel about games," she says. "But importantly I look at gaming culture, not video games themselves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a crucial distinction. Kaufman isn't interested in looking at video games like a book or text, but rather hopes to understand how they shape people and their perspectives. "My special interest is gamer identity," she adds. "So, what is a gamer?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A terminological paradox">A terminological paradox</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In searching for answers, Kaufman sifted through her interview data to summarise all the ways people tried to describe the 'gamer' identity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A gamer is 'someone who plays video games of any gender or sexuality.' 'Someone who enjoys video games.' 'Someone who spends a lot of time playing video games.' This all seems pretty normal at the moment," she continues. "'Someone who knows a lot about video games'–for example, who knows about the latest releases or hastechnical knowledge. And then 'someone who plays a lot of big triple-A games.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Then it starts to get a little bit darker. 'Someone who is abusive about video games.' For example, you might yell at a woman in an online game. Then we have 'someone who enjoys video games too much.' 'A man–probably a white man.' 'Then someone who believes in toxic, patriarchal world views.' It's not looking good. Then we have 'someone who feels like white men are under attack.' Finally, we have 'someone who holds far right or nationalist belief systems.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaufman acknowledges those definitions are "contradictory." For instance, some interviewees felt 'gamer' could include people of any sexuality or gender, while others felt it would primarily encapsulate white men. Another obvious paradox was the contrasting beliefs that 'gamer' could mean someone who enjoys playing video games, versus someone who actively spends a lot of time playing video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You might not think these would contradict each other, but you might be someone who really enjoys playing video game but for some reason doesn't have the time. For example, you might be a single parent with two jobs. Or you might just struggle to get internet access to play the types of games that you'd like," she says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Finally, we had someone who plays a lot of triple-A game like RPGs and first-person shooters, and someone who's abusive in video games. Now, these two contradict in a slightly different way in that you might really enjoy shooters, but don't enjoy being yelled at because of how your voice sounds. This is one way that certain type of gamers can identity police other people who might identify as them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kaufman says her research highlights the complexity of a term riddled with "contradictory meanings." It's important, she says, to understand that 'gamer' can mean wildly different things to different people. So why does it matter? Because when one part of that colossal, diverse community attempts to seize ownership, it can dictate who gets to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This is about who gets to play games. Who companies and developers anticipate will play games. And who feels like video games belong to them," she says. "Importantly, the good stuff doesn't cancel out the bad. Just because some people think 'gamer' is an inclusive, joyful identity, doesn't stop the fact that some people associate it with all these really negative and sometimes dangerous ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Language and the way we talk about things matters. Gaming culture obviously faces a lot of challenges, and I hope the gaming space is one that can acknowledge and recognize this. The National Video Game Museum mission statement is 'video games are for everyone, forever.' I think it's important to remember that sometimes takes work, and not everyone always agrees with us."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/keyword/amaze-sheffield">Click here for more AMAZE Sheffield coverage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

Don’t forget to deliver all the packages to the gods waiting for them!</p><p><em>Outrider Mako</em> was first revealed in 2019, and is a 2D top-down action game. The protagonist is a young girl named Mako who wanders into the strange Mayoi World. In order to return to her own world, she works at a delivery center as a courier and delivers all sorts of items to the gods of the world.</p><p>The game has received and been nominated for many awards since its reveal for its high quality:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>BitSummit 7 Spirits – GetNews Award Winner</li><li>Tokyo Game Show – Dengeki PlayStation Indie Game Category Nominee</li><li>Indie Play – Best Overseas Game Category Nominee</li></ul><p>This is Asamado’s first ever video game, and everything in the game, from programming, graphics, story, music, and artwork, are all done by him alone.</p><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>Mako falls into the Mayoi World and finds herself at the Bumon Delivery Center, which a strange monster named Mozu claims is a package delivery service. Mako ends up becoming an outrider for the delivery center, and by collecting seal stamps in the notebook given to her by Mozu, she might just be able to return to her own world…</p><p><strong>Game System</strong></p><p><em>Outrider Mako</em> is a 2D top-down action game where you control Mako to accept orders as a courier at the delivery center, collect the requested materials, wrap them up nicely in a special package, and deliver them to the gods of the Mayoi World.</p><p>At times you’ll have to collect crystals the gods need for their jobs, and defeat enemies on the way to receive talismans. And once you’ve collected the goods, you’ll have to wrap them up at a workbench before delivering them to your client.</p><p>Once you’ve completed an order, the client will reward you with a Divine Blessing. Every Divine Blessing has a different effect, such as raising Mako’s movement speed or item drop rates. Make Mako stronger with different Divine Blessings to get the upper hand in battle and make exploration a bit easier.</p><p>After each delivery, you’ll return to the delivery center to receive a seal stamp of the god who was your client from Mozu. The goal of the game is to repeat this process until you’ve filled the Apprentice Notes with seal stamps from all the gods of the Mayoi World.</p><p><strong>■ Characteristic Jump Attacks and Sticky Red Nectar Battles</strong></p><p>When Mako wanders into the Mayoi World, she receives three Primal Divine Blessings that allow her to remain unaffected by the ether that fills the air of Mayoi and kills any who can’t attune to it, as well as the ability to use powerful jump attacks and utilize red nectar, the liquid form of energy in this world. All battles in <em>Outrider Mako</em> require the masterful usage of jump attacks and red nectar.</p><p><strong>Defeat Mononoke with Red Nectar and Smite Attacks</strong></p><p>By applying red nectar onto enemies, Mako can stop them in their tracks, and she can splash the nectar onto nearby enemies to spread it out and stop multiple enemies at once. Use this to gain the upper hand in battles against groups of enemies.</p><p>What’s more, she can attack enemies with red nectar on their heads to smite them, which deals extra damage. Red nectar is the most important substance in the Mayoi World.</p><p><strong>Jumping, Pouncing, and Kicking</strong></p><p>In the Mayoi World, there are many objects such as stakes that Mako can jump onto.

            <p>I’d initially assumed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sliding-hero">Sliding Hero</a> counts was a Sokoban-like, until I realised that it’s actually you, not endless boxes, that do the sliding here. Still, I wasn’t entirely convinced. The only thing that’s fun to slide back-and-forth indefinitely is a lounging cat on a smooth kitchen worktop. Still, after messing around with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966300/Sliding_Hero/">Sliding Hero’s Steam demo</a>, I think this one might have much longer legs than its restrictive-sounding concept suggests. All the better to endlessly slide with.</p>

<p>First off, I am an absolute sucker for Venetian carnivalesque trappings. This is partly to do with classic Italian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte">Commedia dell'arte</a> tropes like the Zanni, partly from the miniatures game <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/carnevale/opinion/carnevale-miniatures-game-assassins-creed-cthulhu">Carnevale</a>, and partly from Thomas Ligotti’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_Grottesco_(book)">Teatro Grottesco</a>. It’s such fertile stuff for horror and fantasy, and I’m always delighted to see it pop up in games. The actual game is fairly taut and humble pixel art, albeit with the occasionally wild background feature, like a very large person emerging from a hole in the ground. The character art, conversely, reminds me of Supergiant games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pyre">Pyre</a>, and even coming close to that is a lovely feat of doodling magnificence.</p>
<p>Your character, Luca, only moves by sliding, and always as far as possible in the given direction. Thus, you’ll need to block yourself with environmental obstacles to progress. You’ll also need to clear each screen of enemies before moving on, which you accomplish by sliding into them, preferably after collecting a weapon. There are hop-able pitfalls, timed spiked traps, and other hazards trying to ruin your slideathon. You can also get acquainted with lore-snippets by putting the extra legwork in to collect optional scrolls. The maps string together metroidvania-style, with new paths opening once you grab certain upgrades.</p>
<p>I can see this being a Marmite job, simply because it’s based so heavily around a certain type of puzzle, apparently<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/comments/1cr4s9g/hi_everyone_im_currently_developing_sliding_hero/"> inspired by Pokémon’s ice caves</a>. Still, there’s a lot of imagination here, and it does look to add new wrinkles and ideas the further you progress. Did I write about it just so I got to use the word ‘carnivalesque’? No, entirely no. Was that a massive factor? Look, it’s a good word!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Krafton, the publisher of survival horror game The Callisto Protocol, forced developer Striking Distance to release the game early.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the game's director Glen Schofield, in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IIVia5aiUQ">Dan Allen Gaming</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-callisto-protocol/glen-schofield-interview">PCGamesN</a>) in which he discusses problems during the game's development.

</p>
<p>
Krafton, known for publishing PUBG, insisted the game release three months earlier than Schofield wanted. As a result, two and a half bosses and three or four enemy types were cut from the game.

<p>

Schofield discussed a positive relationship with Krafton at first, but it seems that gradually deteriorated.
</p>
<p>
"I wanted about three and a half more months," said Schofield. "I was led to believe that that was the way it was going to be. In October or September '21, I was told 'You're going to get the time. Put whatever you want into the game.' So I spent that Christmas holiday just designing and coming up with ideas with some of the guys. And then January comes around and some of the [Krafton] folks come over and they just said 'no no no. It's December 2022.'"
</p>
<p>
He continued: "It's not like it costs you less money because you're getting it out three months sooner, because if I'd just kept it on the way it was going, I wouldn't have to add anybody. But if you want it done, that means I've got to accelerate everything by three and a half months, which means I need to jam people on here."
</p>
<p>
Production of The Callisto Protocol was also heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with 10 to 20 people a month getting sick for long periods of time. On top of that, 49 people resigned from the team in 2021. "We were devastated," said Schofield. "'21 was the worst year of development of my life."
</p>
<p>
While Schofield doesn't give a clear reason for Krafton's demands, it may have perhaps been due to the impending release of EA's Dead Space remake that was released in January 2023, a month after Callisto Protocol. 
</p>
<p>
As Schofield created the Dead Space series, the two games were in direct competition. Indeed, he admitted in the interview some of his ideas for Dead Space transferred over, including the prison setting.
</p>
<p>
The Callisto Protocol reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">failed to hit sales targets</a>, which caused Krafton's share prices to fall. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">Striking Distance then laid off 32 employees</a> in August last year - a month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">Schofield left the studio</a> "to pursue new opportunities".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League didn't stop at murdering beloved superheroes from the DC Comics Universe, it also dealt a serious blow to Warner Bros. Discover's games revenue.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q2/earnings-result/WBD-2Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf">financial report</a> for the second quarter of the fiscal year, the company confirmed that games revenue declined by 41% compared to last year in the three-month period that ended on June 30th due to the weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Considering the massively successful Hogwarts Legacy was released last year, a drop was to be expected, but probably not with this magnitude, although this isn't just as surprising, considering the reception of the live service game developed by Rocksteady.</p>
<p>The bad reception for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was totally deserved. The game published by Warner Bros. has a sprinkling of classic Rocksteady charm, but its many issues make it a title worthy of anyone's time only at a heavily discounted price, as Nathan highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Crimson Dusk</strong></p><p>The developer of this game is the Taiwanese indie team Crimson Dusk, formed in May 2020. In 2018, Sam revealed the prototype of <em>Homura Hime</em>, a project he started on his own while he was a student, at a contest. It received a lot of positive feedback, and from there, Crimson Dusk was formed.</p><p><strong>Stage Showcase</strong></p><p>The very first stage of the game is Adashino, a beautiful place surrounded by greenery but covered in graves and Jizo statues. Here, Homura Hime will have to traverse the terrain with all of the basic actions she’s learned. At the end of the stage, she will have to face the archdemon Agasa, who takes the form of a young girl, in a terrifying battle.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_904162"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>Welcome to a world where humans and demons coexist.

Archdemons have the power to corrupt the foundation of the world and contaminate their surroundings. Creatures tainted by this demonic power turn into lowly monsters that operate solely on raw instinct.</p><p>Faced with the threat to the world posed by five extremely powerful demon girls, the High Priestess is forced to dispatch Homura Hime—the “Flame Princess” and the strongest exorcist of them all—and her aide, Ann, who are now entrusted with the divine mission of purifying the world and defeating all demons.</p></blockquote><p>If you missed it in July, watch the latest gameplay trailer below.

		<p>Meta is set to shut down its first-party development studio Ready At Dawn, the company reportedly looking to slash its Reality Labs division budget by 20% in the coming two years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/22/facebook-oculus-ready-at-dawn-buy/">Meta had acquired Ready At Dawn in 2020</a>, with their most recent game being 2021’s Lone Echo 2.</p>


<p>The news comes from an internal memo sent to Meta employees by Gio Hunt, VP Oculus Studios, seen by <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">Android Central</a>, though a Meta spokesperson later told them that the cuts were not specifically to “save money”, but so that Oculus Studios and&nbsp;make a “better long-term impact” in VR development. They also stated that this is not a sign of wider layoffs within the division.</p>
<p>This is deeply disappointing news on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, Ready At Dawn was once a PlayStation mainstay, having been founded in 2003 by former Naughty Dog developers and getting their first break with PSP spin-off Daxter. From there they produced a pair of very well received God of War games for PSP, before ramping up in their ambitions with PlayStation 4 exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-order-1886">The Order: 1886</a>.</p>
<p>That game, while an incredible technical showcase for the PS4, drew only moderate acclaim with critiques of its heavy use of QTEs, overly familiar cover shooting, and a short runtime – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review/">we awarded it a solid 7/10</a>. Unfortunately, that seemed to be the end of the line for Ready At Dawn with PlayStation, and while there were plans for a sequel (the story ended on a transatlantic cliffhanger), the studio had to diversify and find a new direction.</p>

<p>Ready At Dawn latched onto VR gaming just as it was coming to the fore, releasing sci-fi space adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/12/ready-at-dawns-oculus-rift-bound-lone-echo-gains-echo-arena-multiplayer/">Lone Echo for Oculus Rift</a> in 2017 and published by Oculus Studios. A Enders Game-like multiplayer mode Echo Arena was also featured, and available as a standalone game.</p>
<p>However, while Meta has increasingly focused on standalone VR with the Meta Quest line of headsets, Ready at Dawn never really made the same jump. Echo Arena was ported to Meta Quest, but when Lone Echo 2 arrived in 2021 it was only released for the PC VR Oculus Rift headsets. Not only that, but the popular Echo VR was shutdown in August 2023 with only a minimal explanation from Ready At Dawn.</p>
<p>Meta has said that they are encouraging Ready At Dawn employees to apply for roles elsewhere within Oculus Studios, and we hope that everyone is able to land on their feet as soon as possible.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> – Season of the Infernal Hordes has launched, the latest seasonal update bringing a new wave-based battles, Fell Priests to fight, and a whole host of new Uniques and legendary items to earn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Season of the Infernal Hordes | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVSeZrh_4rQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Lord of Hatred’s servants will emerge with the Infernal Hordes, a wave-based feature that you can take on after completing a Questline in World Tier III. You’ll be able to select Infernal Offerings – which are both a boon and a bane to augment your run – between each 60-second wave to optionally increase your enemy’s difficulty and final rewards. Each wave will see the number of enemies increase, and you’ll have a limited number of revives to fall back on, before eventually faving the Fell Council, which feature corrupted Priests that each comes with unique attacks – enemies last seen in Diablo II.</p>
<p>Through each run, you’ll collect Burning Aether, which are then used to unlock Spoils of Hell, should you make it to the end. Smash Soulspires and Aetheric Masses to grab Burning Aether – which is collected individually if you’re playing co-op – and while you won’t lose this resource between deaths, running out of revives will prevent you from getting any Spoils.</p>
<p>The Spoils of Hell can contain Legendary and Unique items, materials for masterworking, gold, and items featuring Greater Affixes. If you save even more Aether through a run, you can unlock the Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>

<p>Alongside this is the Seasonal Progression, which starts in World Tier 1 and 2 with the ‘Of Lambs and Wolves’ questline – Head to Zarbinzet and speak to Captain Cireska. This will help get you up to WT3 if you need it, where you can take on ‘The Eyes of the Enemy’.</p>
<p>For more on everything that Season of the Infernal Hordes contains, head to <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes">Blizzard’s full breakdown.</a></p>
<p>Diablo IV was one of the biggest releases of last year, gaining a coveted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/diablo-iv-review/">9/10 review</a> from us with Gamoc saying, “Diablo IV is almost shockingly refined, with an absorbing story and addictive gameplay. The shift to always online and connected play might turn some away, and the level scaling can make combat a little same-y, but on the whole, this is still Diablo at its best. It plays very well, offers tonnes of options for tailoring your character and acquiring that all important hunt for better and better loot will keep you coming back for more.”</p>

At some point every proud ruler must ask themselves the question: what should I do with all this stupid, tiresome <em>civilisation</em> I've built? Do I let it spin on forever, a gleaming machine of prosperity bathed in an eternal twilight, or do I, as the case may be, unleash a horde of voluptuous hellwomen to gather spirit energy for the resurrection of my tragically slain beloved? If you picked option B you should probably play My Lovely Empress, a plush empire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim with a dastardly twist, from Indonesian team GameChanger Studio. Find a trailer below.

<p>
The gist: you are Emperor Hong of the Crimson Empire. You are a very sad banana, having recently lost both your mother, the previous ruler, and your dear Empress. The Crimson Empire itself is a picturesque quagmire of argumentative nobles, upstart peasants and uncollected taxes. Your viziers are grumbling and neighbouring rival monarchs are weighing their chances, but all you want to do is mope in your sanctum.
</p>
<p>
You don't appear to have access to any professional grief counsellors, not even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-therapist">vampire with CBT training</a>. You do, however, have the ability to summon Yaoguai, or demons of the north, all of whom take the form of sultry, sinister monster ladies with upgradeable stats and characteristics.</p>
<p>They'll help you with your imperial duties, like going on diplomatic missions or, er, terrorising the smallfolk with curses. You can also sacrifice them for unspecified boons, preferably after improving your relationship with them to increase the ectoplasmic yields. Ultimately, you must decide whether to permit them to harvest your citizens in a Mephistophelian bargain for the return of your lost wife.
</p>
<p>
In broad strokes, the game looks to be a mixture of dating sim, visual novel and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a>-style plucking at sumptuous, painted regional maps, which periodically cough up branching snippets of story quest. It forms a trilogy of My Lovely games, the others being My Lovely Wife and My Lovely Daughter, each also the story of a grieving man conjuring thirsty diablettes to wreak horrors or be sacrificed. I guess crazy widowers are GameChanger's house style.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052990/My_Lovely_Empress/">its Steam page</a>, the game takes heavy inspiration from East and Southeast Asia mythology. It certainly looks a treat, with visuals that remind me a little of Darkest Dungeon and Hades. The spooky ghost ladies are all teen-rated, but this possibly isn't SFW: expect "Infrequent Violence, General Mature Content, and Sexual Content."
</p>
<p>
It's out on 21st August. Anybody here played any of the other My Lovelies? How Lovely are they, exactly, on a scale of "inoffensive" to "gorgeous"? I do relish a calculatedly unpleasant spin on the management genre, which tends to skew anodyne.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be more or less on par with the Steam Deck, but software limitations could impact the system's performance heavily.</p>
<p>Commenting on the leaked specs of the next console from Nintendo during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a> Broken Silicon podcast, Alderon Games' Matthew Cassells provided some very interesting insights on the upcoming system. While its specs should put its performance almost on par with the Steam Deck, though the Switch 2's CPU's weaker single core could impact performance in certain scenarios, as we already heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">last month</a>, some decisions made on the software side of things could be very limiting. Console manufacturers include in their systems security processors and encryption that introduce limitations, and the same is likely happening with the new Nintendo console, especially considering how the Switch was hacked and even a working flash cart was released on the market not too long ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Nintendo Switch 2 could have some more limitations that few could foresee. For example, on the current system, a game cannot write too much data to prevent flash storage from getting worn out, which is a rather big limitation for certain types of games. The current console also has a strict patch size limitation, which can also be impactful.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 should be more than enough for the foreseeable future, as the 12GB of RAM shouldn't create problems if high resolutions are not targeted. However, more complex games using ray tracing or advanced Unreal Engine 5 stuff may require upscaling from some very low resolutions, resulting in blurry image quality.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially unveiled. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-release-date-set-for-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind Games have announced that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead">A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</a> will launch on 17th October 2024, the horror game based on the popular film franchise coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riegOv5eRuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer shows a mixture of gameplay and cinematics, and how the game puts and emphasis on staying as quiet as possible. A bit tricky when you can accidentally knock into buckets, when a gantry can give out beneath your feet, and when needing to use an asthma inhaler.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-story-trailer-shows-off-snippets-of-noisy-gameplay/">Previous trailers</a> have shown a good deal more, including introducing the relationship between Alex, our asthmatic college student protagonist, and her boyfriend Martin. The two will have to survive together, and there’s some gameplay and narrative touches like them using basic hand and head communication to direct one another, while the world is daubed with messages saying not to scream even in the “safe” room, and plenty more.</p>
<p>It’s not all going to be silent, sneaky horror though, with high action moments that will involve cars, shotguns and alarms, which will absolutely bring those monsters right to where you are. Best to avoid those, eh?</p>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. This looks to be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game, though the trailer clearly plucked out some of the more action-y moments that put the Quiet Place monsters in frame. I’d expect the overarching pacing to be much more considered and slower paced, though.</p>

        <p>On reflection I probably won't be writing the words 'fits' again</p>

            <p>It is I, the wound salter. The injury insult adder. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> life-em-up from Paradox, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">canceled in June</a> after being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>. The day after the cancellation - which Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester implied was down to a “lacking”, unfixable development state - designer Willem Delventhal spoke about his time at the subsequently shuttered Paradox Tectonic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-devs-spent-a-month-in-purgatory-prior-to-closure-says-laid-off-designer-despite-their-sim-like-exceeding-paradoxs-expectations">He claimed the team</a> spent a month “in purgatory” prior to being told of the game’s cancelation and studio shuttering two weeks before launch, despite being told by higher-ups that work was “exceeding expectations.”</p>
<p>We’ve now got another look at a game we’ll likely never get, <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1820794843171307903">thanks to a thread</a> by Twxbbly user SimMattically collating unseen screenshots from portfolios by several artists who worked on Life By You.</p>

<p>Admittedly, the screens aren’t worlds apart from the <a href="https://youtu.be/sIjAKcmPSbM">most recent gameplay</a> shown off by Tectonic, but that’s unsurprising considering how near the game was to release. The character customisation does look sharper and more detailed from where I’m sitting though, and the birds-eye house shots and those of the surrounding area do seem a little more cohesive and crisp than previous looks. There are also many snazzy outfits, which I’m sure are a big part of the reason people play these games to begin with, although I personally do not feel represented in the lack of coffee-stained trackie bottoms.</p>
<p>“Life by You had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them,” said Paradox Interactive CEO Fredrik Wester<a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/"> at the time</a>. “However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop.”</p>
<p>“This is difficult and drastic news for our colleagues at Tectonic, who’ve worked hard on Life by You’s Early Access release,” Wester said of the studio’s closure. “Sadly, with cancellation of their sole project, we have to take the tough decision to close down the studio.”</p>
<p>“Two weeks before launch we were told we wouldn't be launching, and just now that we've all lost our jobs,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7208887303224606720/">wrote Delventhal on LinkedIn</a> the following day. "We were only informed of this via a public announcement. This industry has become a place in which you can deliver more than expected, have AA money behind you, and still have the rug pulled two weeks before launch."</p>
<p>Again, I likely wouldn’t have spent much time with Life By You, but I was still interested in having a tinker. The Sims could do with a sizeable competitor, especially since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-4-devs-assemble-team-to-focus-on-fixing-bugs-and-upping-performance-updates-to-now-land-every-two-months">recent updates seem to have been plagued by bug woes</a>. So, yeah, bummed for you if you were looking forward to this, and it sounds like the team behind it deserved a lot better too. Paradox themselves have been no stranger to mishaps recently, having just slapped an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">indefinite delay</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> after parting ways with the original developer and handing it off to a new studio. Let’s hope it doesn’t meet the same fate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Game Science has released a fresh trailer for forthcoming action-RPG Black Myth: Wukong ahead of its release later this month.
</p>
<p>
The trailer gives an extended look at the world of the game, the combat and transformational abilities of the monkey protagonist, and the imposing bosses he'll face - from smaller enemies to colossal beasts.
</p>
<p>
You may want to skip the trailer if you're looking to go in completely spoiler free, but it's certainly worth a look to admire the dramatic production.

<p>

Black Myth: Wukong is set for release on 20th August across PC and PS5. With its basis in the classic novel Journey to the West, it's steeped in Chinese folklore.
</p>
<p>
However, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed</a> as it requires more time for optimisation and remains without a release date.

</p>
<p>
Chinese developer Game Science has also courted controversy following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-wukong-trailer-resurfaces-misogynistic-comments-from-developer">reports of misogyny at the studio</a>. When Eurogamer contacted the developer with regards to these reports, it declined to comment.

</p>
<p>
I've been hands-on with Black Myth: Wukong a couple of times: at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukongs-combat-could-surpass-the-souls-games">Gamescom last year</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-is-a-brilliant-boss-rush-but-is-it-a-soulslike">preview session more recently</a>.
</p>
<p>
I came away impressed with its visuals and boss battles, though it feels a little empty in the space between. 

</p>
<p>
Is it a Soulslike? Game Science calls it an action-RPG and appears keen to separate itself from FromSoftware's work, though it certainly has some of the trappings of the genre.
