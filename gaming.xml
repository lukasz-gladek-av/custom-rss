It’s all pretty standard turning knobs and flipping switches, though I fear there’s nothing in here that’s going to make anyone who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>hates the chaotic menace that is Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> any happier.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/?blzcmp=app"><span>patch notes</span></a><span> aren’t that extensive, as the update seems to be mostly targeting a few pain points in Domina, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-anran-face-comparison-change-voice-fareeha-2000666873"><span>Anran</span></a><span>, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki’s kits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> is also here, and since she was the last hero to join the roster before the big reboot, it makes sense she might still need some tinkering. It’s not all nerfs, though, as Anran and Mizuki have a few buffs in the mix. The full change log is as follows:</span></p>

<p>Head back to the spooky Nitemare Island and check out the Friday the 13th-themed skins that have returned to Fortnite for the weekend.</p>



<p>Fortnite announced on social media that Nitemare Island would return to Reload, the Battle Royale-themed mode that launched in 2024. Along with that, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers are back in the game, in skins for the time being.</p>



<p>Nitemare Island originally debuted in October 2025 and was the fifth Reload map. Epic says that you have until 9:00 a.m. ET on Monday, February 16, to jump back into the Halloween-themed map. What a great weekend for Valentine’s Day.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-news-on-future-fortnite-collabs">News on Future Fortnite Collabs</h2>



<p>Just like Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, Fortnite has collaborated with numerous IPs to create a truly unique, if not outright bizarre, gaming experience. Right next to Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers, you can also purchase SpongeBob SquarePants. Looking for a Jam track? There are plenty of choices from Chapell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter, but you can also choose Feel Good Inc. by The Gorillaz.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/girls-frontline-2-exilium-announces-strong-new-dolls-and-free-rewards-coming-in-next-patch</link>
            <guid>1435684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Girls Frontline 2: Exilium recently revealed the new content that’s coming in its next patch on February 19, and there’s a lot. The headliners are two new T-Dolls, Alva and Voymastina, the latter of which is the strongest Doll in the game. Alva will arrive on February 19, and Voymastina will arrive on March 12. On top of that, there’s new story content, limited-time outfits and events, and lots of free rewards.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New T-Dolls Join the Fray</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Alva, the dependable leader of Task Force DEFY, is the first new Doll to join the roster. Though reserved in demeanor, she is fiercely protective of her squad. She’s a Support-class Doll and excels at providing powerful shields and enhancing team survivability, making her a natural fit for shield-focused teams. With her signature weapon, 6P33, she increases the critical damage of Freeze-based allies and further amplifies the damage of shielded units, turning defense into offense. She synergizes particularly well with Robella, creating a 1+1&gt;2 effect, and her arrival marks the full realization of shield-centric Freeze teams.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/alva-kv-update-1770923971757.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new story content, called Corposant, will be released in three parts on February 19, February 26, and March 12. It features CG animations and delivers an experience comparable to a visual novel, with more than 100,000 English words. When the final chapter launches on March 12, it will also introduce the highly anticipated new Doll Voymastina, who is officially recognized as the strongest second-generation Doll in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Codenamed “White Mastiff,” Voymastina is a physical-team core damage dealer who specializes in defense-ignoring capabilities, delivering massive physical damage through both active and support attacks. Her exclusive effect, Predator’s Principle, boosts burst damage, while Eye of the White Mastiff enables sustained offensive pressure. Debuting alongside her is the Elite assault rifle 6P71 (Medium Ammo), Voymastina’s imprinted signature weapon, designed to complete her combat profile and reinforce her role as a top-tier damage dealer.
</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/voymastina-kv-available-on-12-march-1770924024983.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Free Goodies on the Way</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch will add lots of new free rewards, led by the ability to earn 55+ pulls, 11,000+ Collapse Pieces, an Elite Doll (Balthilde), and a Commander outfit during the themed Corposant event that launches February 19.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, there are multiple upcoming log-in events that can score you additional goodies. Starting February 19, you can log in to receive 10 Targeted Access Permissions (which are used to pull for characters) and sign in to receive another 10. And another event starts March 12, where you can get an additional 10. Also starting February 19, you can get one reward mail every week, each containing one Access Permission, 100 Collapse Pieces (which can be used to get more Targeted Access Permissions), and 100 Next-Gen Memory Sticks (which can be used to increase your affinity with individual Dolls).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From February 19 to April 1, the limited-time Splash Bash event introduces a PK-style gameplay mode featuring interactive matchups between Dolls and players. There’s streamlined gameplay guidance and stage-clearing tips, making the mode a light but competitive change of pace. And you can unlock the exclusive Commander outfit Leisurely Heat by participating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/splash-bash-gameplay-1770924061482.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of all this, the upcoming patch will also add limited-time discounts on three new outfits: Alva - Antje, Lenna - Flying Phantom, and Nikketa - Night on the Silver Bay. And there will be a new permanent gameplay mode called Ashen Tales in Artifact Recovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, Girls Frontline 2: Exilium will continue to release more new content in the future. In the next six months, you can expect extensive story updates, new gameplay modes, new Dolls and outfits, and collaborations with other major IPs.

            <title><![CDATA[New Pokémon Pinball Machine Lets You Catch, Battle, and Complete a Pokédex]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-pinball-machine-lets-you-catch-battle-and-complete-a-pokedex</link>
            <guid>1435678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stern Pinball Inc. has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to create the first Pokémon-themed pinball machine ever. While Pokémon has appeared in pinball form on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance in the past, this is the first attempt at an arcade-ready machine. But this isn’t a throwback; Pokémon Pinball by Stern has tons of crazy high-tech bells and whistles, like the ability to collect Pokémon while playing the machine and save your progress on a Pokédex on your phone, several interactive toys like an animatronic Pikachu, and an HD screen with tons of anime footage. While Stern has only just announced Pokémon, it’s out really soon (in the coming months). We travelled to Stern’s factory to check it out. And after playing a bunch of games we can confirm: It’s awesome. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon by Stern Pinball</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">In Good Company </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon Company worked with Stern extremely closely on making sure Pokémon was represented perfectly; we heard a lot about that partnership during our visit to Stern’s factory, and it’s obvious from playing the Pokémon machine that Stern really <em>gets</em> Pokémon. Lead Programmer Tanio Klyce explained, “A lot of work went into marrying the necessary pinball design with Pokémon,” and it is clear that they used the license to make a game about battling, catching, and living in the world of Pokémon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokepremleft-1770998077040.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Premium version of Pokémon by Stern Pinball Inc.  Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The art package is focused on Kanto Region Pokémon – the first 151 Gen 1 Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue – and you start the game with Gen 1 starters available for battles, which we will get to in a bit. The toys and art are clearly a result of careful collaboration. Klyce says, “We didn’t draw anything, we essentially composited [The Pokémon Company’s] stuff … They are very particular. Line weights, colors, relative scales of characters went under tremendous scrutiny.” While that may sound intense, it actually ended up lending the project a sense of legitimacy, according to longtime Stern pinball designer and one of Pokémon’s co-leads, George Gomez.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the art on the cabinet, there’s plenty more Pokémon crammed into this machine. The monitor in the back glass works in anime clips from Seasons 10-25. For example, if you hit the right ramp a few times you can start a Pikachu vs. Raichu mode in which battle scenes from the anime are shown on screen while you play a multiball mode. The speakers blast the Pokémon theme song, and Meowth’s taunts from the anime are piped in – the voice actor for Giovani even recorded custom shoutouts for certain modes (deeper in the game there are Regional Rivals and even Gym Battles and an ultimate Master Battle against Giovanni. We didn’t get to those… yet!).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Catch ‘Em (Pinb)All</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Gen 1 and Kanto region is the focus of the side art, backglass, and playfield art, Klyce adds, “We have Pokémon in the game from all the Generations … At launch we have 182 that you can discover and catch.” He also says “more are coming” which is a nod at the online nature of Stern Machines these days: Updates can be pushed in the background to add content or limited time events, which, of course, is a perfect match for Pokémon. Here’s how this could work: As you approach a Stern pinball machine, you can log in with a QR code on the Stern Insider Connected app on your phone. Once you do this, you can track your scores, unlock Achievements, and, in Pokémon, add to your Pokédex. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/poke112-1770998086640.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A view of the Pokémon playfield and toys. Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you discover new Pokémon, a special Pokedex section of the Insider Connected app will get filled out. Stern may then push an update adding to the Pokémon available in the machine and thus expand the Pokédex. It’s not going to be easy! Catching Pokémon is kinda hard in pinball: First, you can basically hit any target or shot to fill a meter – the pop bumpers are “tall grass” that fills the catch meter fast. After this, a random Pokémon will appear. These are based on the biome you are in, which you play in order: Forest,  Lake, Mountain, Desert (in the Forest, we ran into a Kakuna, a Bewear, and a Venomoth). At this point you have to shoot a lit purple flashing shot to reveal the Pokémon in the Pokédex. Then you have to shoot the Pokéball toy to capture the Pokémon. This not only adds the Pokémon to your ‘dex, but also unlocks a Battle…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Battle Ready</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Ash’s favorite catch phrase, you don’t choose your starters. When start a game, you have a team of four: Squirtle, Pikachu, Charmander, and Bulbasaur. Once you start a Battle by shooting the scoop on the right, you must aim for shots that are lit up to guide you through the battle, with each lamp sending you up a ramp or around a loop or at a target. The first Pokémon automatically deployed in battle is Bulbasaur, and purple shots for poison attacks and green shots for grass attacks are lit up. If you dawdle, the adversary will attack you. In one battle vs. Scyther, we weren’t making good progress with Bulbasaur’s plant attacks, but after a few shots, we lit a shot in a scoop on playfield that let us switch to Charmander and then properly torched Scyther. It was actually kind of sad! The score went way up. Limiting your squad may seem odd, but it’s also super effective: Successfully nailing shots in pinball is a lot harder than selecting your next move in turn-based combat. It’s kind of like playing on a Game Boy while also juggling it! But it does feel like Pokémon, and catching, collecting, and battling Pokémon just feels totally cool and new when done with pinball flippers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokepremiumtop-1770998364620.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The full Premium version Pokémon playfield. Photo: Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Version Differences</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While they don’t come in Red, Blue, and Yellow versions, there are diffent versions of Pokémon available: The Premium and Limited Edition (LE) versions ship with an animatronic Pikachu toy that wobbles about, an interactive Pokéball toy that snatches the pinball and hides it from view, and a magnet that flings the pinball around under the Meowth Balloon toy. These versions also have metal ramps and a more complicated left whirlpool ramp. The LE version (a limited run of 750 machines) has additional lighting, colored “armor” (the metal lining and legs on the cabinet), and its own custom art scheme. The Pro version is stripped down a bit with a non-interactive Pikachu and Pokéball toy and no magnet, but it closely resembles the other models outwardly and also features the pretty cool Meowth Balloon that swoops across the playfield for an easy target (and easy multiball). Other Stern machines have much more striking differences across their models; the most we noticed about the Pro was that the lack of the metal parts and lighting made it look a bit cheaper – which it is. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/pokeleleft-020326-1770998278785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Limited Edition cabinet for Pokémon Pinball by Stern.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can’t wait to play more Pokémon from Stern – the idea of filling out a Pokédex in a whole new way across multiple machines, arcades, bars, and game rooms is super cool and like nothing that’s been done before. And while the innovation is clear in features like the Pokédex, battles, and DLC potential, the basic layout of Pokémon feels approachable and classic like Attack from Mars (central bash shot) or Monster Bash (obvious shots tied to characters). That makes sense because Pokemon Pinball is the product of both one of Stern’s newest designers, Jack Danger, and George Gomez, who worked on classics like The Lord of the Rings and the aforementioned Monster Bash. The shots were easy to hit and flow felt good, but we drained a lot – there’s nothing kiddie about the gameplay on this machine, despite its appearance. And that’s what both Pokémon and pinball have in common: Anyone can play, but few can become a master. We should hear more about Pokémon Pinball from Stern in the coming weeks; the MSRP of the Pro model is set at $6,999, with the Premium at $9,699 and the LE at $12,999 and all <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">models are available for pre-order now</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-pokemon-pinball-machine-lets-you-catch-battle-and-complete-a-pokedex]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Console Archives Cool Boarders (Switch 2) - Not Up There With 1080, But Still Pretty Rad]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders</link>
            <guid>1435669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hamster Corporation is on something of a winning streak, with the fantastic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-arcade-archives-game-on-nintendo-switch-plus-our-top-picks">Arcade Archives</a> series continually dusting off and polishing hundreds of notable games from the annals of history. Well, those wizards are back with the fresh <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/hamsters-console-archives-starting-lineup-revealed-includes-more-than-10-titles">Console Archives</a> brand, and the now 30-year-old ‘radical’ PlayStation sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Cool Boarders</a> is one of the first. Yes, 1996, three whole years before anything <strong>Tony Hawk</strong>-related would reach consoles.</p>
<p>Much like the difference between skateboarding and snowboarding, in Cool Boarders, your character feels heavy, and your movements must be slow and deliberate if you want to pull off tricks. All this while carving fresh powder to avoid hitting trees or plummeting to a mountainous death. 'B' lets you jump, which will build speed and help you initiate tricks when leaping off heights. Meanwhile, 'Y' works as the Drift button, letting you quickly change direction and better handle corners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are aiming to either get the highest trick score or the best time on each of the courses. You’ll start out meagrely, shrugging yourself off a ledge and maybe pulling off a 180, but there’s a high skill ceiling waiting to be found. When you ready a jump, the amount of time you press and hold a directional button before you leap dictates how fast you spin. Combine this with a Grab by holding 'R', and with a bit of patience, you’ll be hurtling down courses while pulling off sick 900 Nosegrabs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the stubborn gameplay is accentuated with great and suitably audacious '90s music, and some silly but nostalgic sound effects and narration. But, compared to its favourably reviewed peer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080 Snowboarding</a>, Cool Boarders doesn't quite compete in either the pure fun of the gameplay or the amount of content.</p>
<p>Hamster has preserved the visuals beautifully, glitches and all. Here, the PS1 original's 240p pixels are polished and presented faithfully, especially compared to the smooth anti-aliasing sheen found in the 2024 PS5 version, but anyone hoping for any upscaling options is out of luck. You can play around with the aspect ratio, either to fill the screen or condense it to perfect-pixel parity, but there's not much in the way of borders or other presentation options. However, the emulation seems to run perfectly, with no noticeable drops in frame rate or frame pacing, and thankfully, the CRT filters are gorgeous.</p>
<p>One issue is that while there is Quick Save and Quick Load, I would have just preferred a rewind option, or something as wild as the ability to slow the game's speed. I mapped the Save/Load buttons to the controller, but it still got things muddled up. Rewind would feel better, especially in a game where one mistake can ruin a run.</p>
<p>Neither the visuals nor the gameplay has aged as gracefully as 1080, but Hamster has done good work in presenting the snowy vistas and demanding gameplay for the modern day. Cool Boarders is a blast to play for short sessions, especially if you loved it back in the '90s, and while a couple of extra options might have been nice, this is the best way to play this beloved early entry in the ‘extreme’ sports genre.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders]]></content:encoded>

The update notes state that this data will be “stored without connection to your Steam account” and will be used to monitor game compatibility and to improve Steam.

            <guid>1435660</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Updates have been announced for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6 </a>in version 1.2.1.0</p>



<p>The Battlefield Communications team announced the next major update to the game. This next update adds new weapons, the “Contaminated” map, new limited-time modes, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-modes-coming-to-battlefield-6">New Modes Coming to Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>The update, scheduled to go live on February 17, adds new modes. These limited-time modes are built around a new psychoactive weapon, VL-7</p>



<p>VL-7 Strike is a limited-time mode where psychoactive smoke spreads across select areas in multiplayer and REDSEC. Players must wear masks and carefully manage their filters, as running out will leave them vulnerable to the disorienting effects of VL-7.</p>











<h2 id="h-map-and-mode-fixes-weapon-balancing-coming-in-new-update">Map and Mode Fixes, Weapon Balancing Coming in New Update</h2>



<p>The update fixes numerous map exploits, traversal issues, capture logic problems, and world reset bugs across Conquest, Breakthrough, Strikepoint, Gauntlet, and other modes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the update delivers a broad recoil tuning pass across automatic weapons, alongside targeted balance fixes to improve consistency, clarity, and long-term weapon handling.</p>







<p>Other issues related to Portal stability, audio, and more were addressed. Players can check out the full statement <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022340361868198355?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/waymo-ai-taxi-robocars-close-doors-pay-doordash-drivers-atlanta-real-2000668711</link>
            <guid>1435591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robotaxi car company Waymo and food delivery app DoorDash confirmed that, yes, they are working together to send people out to close car doors left open by careless riders. We live in a sad and horrible future.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/">a Reddit post from a DoorDash driver went semi-viral</a> as it seemingly showed the app offering the user $6.25 to go drive a few blocks and close a Waymo door that was left open. Once the task was completed and verified, the driver would be paid an additional $5. The user had never seen an offer like this before and asked others if they had been asked to go close a robotaxi’s door. Some even wondered if the driver was faking the order entirely for some odd reason. But nope, this is real.</p>   <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reached out</a>&nbsp;to Waymo and DoorDash about the post, and the two companies confirmed they are indeed working together and paying people to close doors.</p> <p>“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” said the companies in a joint statement.</p>

 <p>Yes, this means that DoorDashers are getting paid to close doors on vehicles that are designed to one day replace them and other drivers completely. But hey, $11 is nice, I guess. And maybe the robots will remember the ones who closed the doors for them and be nicer to them when they run everything.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dang, The Wait For KPop Demon Hunters 2 Is Gonna Be Longer Than We Thought]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-release-date-netflix-songs-2000668712</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span>, and since it’s going to take a long time to animate, it’s going to take a long time before it eventually arrives on Netflix. For a time, the movie was projected to come out in 2029, a good four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the original blew up last year</span></a><span>. But now, it sounds like it might take even longer than that.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/sony-kpop-demon-hunters-2-spider-verse-pressure-3-goat-1236503016/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Sony Pictures Animation president Kristine Belson didn’t say much about </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2</span></i><span>, but did heavily imply that the planned 2029 date is probably not going to pan out. When </span><i><span>THR</span></i><span> said that a 2029 release seemed “far-fetched,” Belson responded by, as the outlet describes, placing “her pointer finger to her nose, to indicate that’s correct thinking.” Could we be waiting until 2030? 2031? That’s brutal.</span></p>

 <p><span>From the sound of it, even in these very early stages the team has been so busy during awards season that directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans have had little time to buckle down on the project. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been doing very well at award shows, with wins at the Academy Awards and the Grammys, among many others. I guess all that flying back and forth between different events does have a way of complicating things. Larian expressed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323"><span>a similar sentiment when </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>was winning a bunch of awards</span></a><span> after it launched in 2023, which had staff out of the office and at award shows so much it got in the way of the studio’s work.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2 </span></i><span>has a lot of potential threads to follow whenever it does eventually come out. The first movie doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, per se, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>there are a lot of character beats it only briefly touches on</span></a><span> that could be expanded into a full-blown sequel. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's upcoming Virtual Boy accessory can be used to play Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it's been reported. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a> has tested the new Virtual Boy headset (and its cheaper cardboard alternative) with the four games, which previously received VR modes to become compatible with Nintendo Labo VR following its launch back in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As VGC reports, the new Virtual Boy accessory works in an identical manner to Nintendo Labo VR, essentially acting as a shell with a pair of lenses for your Switch screen. (And yes, you can remove those red Virtual Boy lenses.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewing the four classic Switch games in their VR modes, players are treated to a VR effect, and can look around naturally by moving their head — which is tracked by the console's motion sensors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does Nintendo intend for you to use your new Virtual Boy accessory this way? It's debatable. On the one hand, using the actual Virtual Boy accessory for this is a little difficult, since it is designed to sit on a flat surface, removing your ability to look around easily. On the other, VGC notes that Breath of the Wild's Switch 2 upgrade retains its VR mode option, so perhaps this was the plan all along. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo will officially launch its Virtual Boy Nintendo Classics collection next week on February 17, which you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription on either Switch or Switch 2 to access. You'll also need a Virtual Boy ($99.99) or cardboard Virtual Boy ($24.99) accessory, sold via the My Nintendo Store. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Virtual Boy for Nintendo Switch</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of next week, the Virtual Boy library will arrive with the following games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Galactic Pinball</li><li>Teleroboxer</li><li>RED ALARM</li><li>Virtual Boy Wario Land</li><li>3-D Tetris</li><li>Golf</li><li>The Mansion of Innsmouth

No, probably not," IGN wrote after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-on-switch-2-discovering-nintendos-greatest-failure">going face-on with the Virtual Boy accessories recently</a>. "There are only seven of them to play at launch, and they are more enjoyable from a historical perspective than an entertainment one. You could buy seven superior indie games for 100 bucks that come in more than just one color. But if you love exploring wacky bygones from past eras and want a really cool accessory to display in your game room, you’ll probably really like the new Virtual Boy like I did."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

      <p>This week, Gita and Luke are joined by Brendan Caldwell of the new independent media website <a href="https://www.jank.cool/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jank.Cool</u></a>, which has maybe the best domain name of all time.</p><p>Jank is a website about PC gaming, started by Caldwell and his colleagues from Rock, Paper, Shotgun, John Hicks and Graham Smith. As far as I can tell, it is also a website for absolute sickos. It features blogs about <a href="https://www.jank.cool/three-game-devs-climb-a-mountain/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forcing game developers to play <em>Peak </em>while answering interview questions</u></a>; <a href="https://www.jank.cool/i-wish-videogame-culture-would-take-more-cues-from-readers/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking more cues from book reading nerds</u></a>; and just <a href="https://www.jank.cool/its-a-car-mechanic-sim-where-your-mates-do-all-the-work/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>straight up torturing your friends in a video game about running a car shop</u></a>. Other than the website you are reading currently, this is the platonic ideal of a website about video games.</p><p>We also discussed Luke's life of constantly being attacked by Magpies, Gita’s frustrations with the romances in Cyberpunk 2077, the trials and tribulations of having your own website, and then Gita’s cat Ella meows directly in the mic, sidetracking everyone.</p>

<p>As shared on the movie's official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUtDqY9gExC/">socials</a>, the poster shows Nintendo's prized plumber in his iconic Galaxy 'spin' pose. A heap of enemies soar through the clouds behind him, with Spike, Piranha Plant, Koopa Paratroopers, Lakitu and even Sledge Bro making an appearance.</p>
<p>"Same hero, new adventure. Mario returns in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, only in theaters April 1," the accompanying caption reads — hey, it's always nice to have a reminder about that release date moving forward.</p>

<p>We last got an extended look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in last month's dedicated Direct presentation, where we were <em>officially</em> introduced to Yoshi. A handful of smaller 'teaser' trailers have since been released, showcasing a little more Yoshi and giving us another look at that Odyssey dinosaur.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-reportedly-headline-februarys-ps-plus-extra-games/">Leaked earlier in the week by Dealabs</a> and confirmed at yesterday's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, the latest web-swinging adventure from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>, 2023's <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</strong> is the headlining title for the February 2026 batch of <strong>PS Plus Extra</strong> games entering the Game Catalog. It enters the library of games that players have access to through their subscription, alongside <strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-marvels-spider-man-2-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-neva-season-a-letter-to-the-future-and-more/">eight other games</a></strong>, including several of the more notable indie releases from the last few years.</p>



<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 wasn't the only game that was leaked ahead of this batch's official confirmation. <strong>Neva</strong> and <strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong> were also part of the leak, with the remaining seven games being surprises. </p>



<p>All of the games entering the PS Plus Extra Game Catalog this month will be available as of <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>. Of the nine joining the library, <strong>four</strong> of them are indie titles that you should take the time to check out if you've not played them before, particularly if you're a fan of strong narrative storytelling. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/venba/"><strong>Venba</strong>,</a> Neva, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/season-a-letter-to-the-future/"><strong>Season: A Letter to the Future</strong>,</a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/echoes-of-the-end-review/">Echoes of the End</a></strong> are all indie games worth checking out, especially as games you can play as part of a larger subscription.</p>



<p>While Echoes of the End may be the weakest of the bunch in terms of its narrative chops, it does have more action-focused gameplay and a few puzzle mechanics that could keep you intrigued. This version of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-free-update-improves-combat-and-more/">is also a much better one than what we played at launch</a> when we reviewed it, where it still featured several glaring technical and design issues. </p>



<p>Two other notable entries in this month's batch are the first two <strong>Monster Hunter Stories</strong> titles, which arrive just in time for anyone who has been intrigued by trailers for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a></strong> but missed the first two games.</p>



<p>As for PS Plus Premium subscribers, they are only getting one game in this batch of releases, which is <strong>Disney Pixar's Wall-E</strong>, a game made by <strong>Asobo Studio</strong> that first arrived on the PlayStation 2 back in 2008.</p>

<figcaption><em>Reanimal </em>is getting hammered on Steam over its lack of a Friend Pass.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Friend Pass does appear to be available on PS5 and Switch 2, so it's PC (and Xbox Series X|S) players who are missing out here, even if they do want to play with their buddies on those platforms.</p><p>Players are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199468943824/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pointing</a> to the lack of a Friend Pass as a critical issue for them; <em>Reanimal </em>is, at least in part, being sold on its co-op nature, so the fact that such a crucial feature for co-op play is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/yveris/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">missing</a> serves as a reason to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/MooseSteakIsNeverAMistake/recommended/2129530/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">criticize the game</a> for many.</p><p>Rest assured, though, that if you're one of the people waiting for the Friend Pass, Tarsier Studios and THQ Nordic are working on it. In a Steam Community <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2129530/discussions/0/796709978759015686/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">post</a>, the publisher says the PC Friend Pass "will come later today" and that it's the team's "top priority".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Reanimal</em>, it's the latest game from <em>Little Nightmares </em>creator Tarsier Studios, and like the developer's previous work, it pits helpless characters against untold horrors in an obscure world full of grotesque creatures.</p>
<p><em>Reanimal </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129530/REANIMAL/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/reanimal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/reanimal/9n67dhnp2m0t" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/reanimal-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a>.
