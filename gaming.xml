		<p>EA and Full Circle have confirmed that Skate will be entering early access on September 16th, with the game available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One. The game will be free to play and feature both cross platform progression and cross platform play.</p>
<p><iframe title="skate. | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;skate.,”</em> said Jeff Seamster, Head of Creative on Skate<i>.</i><em> “From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community – listening, learning and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in,&nbsp;skate.&nbsp;is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers – just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</em></p>
<p>In Skate, players will be able to roll, grind, and ollie around the city of San Vansterdam which will be a large open world, with plenty of places to pull of tricks. San Vansterdam is split into four different neighbourhoods which are Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich. Each area has its own challenges and unique designs. To pull off various moves, the Flick-It system is going to be the key as it will be offering precision and control. New tricks are being added to Skate as well, and these are wallies, slappies and firecrackers. Additional features like Quick Drop will allow players to add ramps and rails to areas, allowing customisation that will allow refreshing of areas.</p>

		<p>Here is a blast from the past! Acclaim has announced that it will be revealing details about new games including exclusives on September 10th. It seems very much that Acclaim has some projects already signed up but has opened pitches for developers to reach out to the company with their games for the chance to get Acclaim as their publisher.</p>
<p><iframe title="#PlayAcclaim Transmission Received: A New Era is Coming" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>According to the official website, <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">PlayAcclaim</a>, this iteration of Acclaim, <em>“is founded by a passionate team of industry veterans with a focus on empowering developers and creators to bring their games to the widest possible audience. We provide funding and publishing services to video game developers, including production, PR/marketing support, distribution and more.”</em></p>
<p>Acclaim was a massive publisher from the late 80s through to the early 2000s, with games including The Punisher, The Simpsons: Bart vs the Space Mutants, WWF Royal Rumble, Mortal Kombat, Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, and South Park. We do not know what games this new Acclaim will be bringing, so we will find out on September 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were able to go hands-on with The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and speak to two of the key developers from MachineGames (Lead Game Designer Ezekiel Virant and Creative Director Axel Torvenius) as they led us through the making of this expansion, which will be released on September 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and will eventually be available on Nintendo Switch 2 next year once the game launches there. Let's begin with the developers' words.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> The Order of Giants DLC's premise is that we set out to place the beginning of the DLC inside the Vatican sandbox, so you need to have played the game up to a certain point in the Vatican sandbox, and if you have the DLC installed, we have this new character called Father Orlando Ricci. When you interact with him, he will trigger a cutscene, which activates the DLC.</p>



<p>Father Ricci is obviously very, very obsessed with finding this secret chamber. He's also hinted that Father Ventura is onto him and that he's being forced out of the Vatican, which hints to the fact that only a small part of the DLC takes place inside the Vatican sandbox, maybe 10 or 15 minutes of gameplay, but then we quite quickly push the players to a complete new path, which is the streets of the Rome and the Tiber river and all the places underneath. Even the spaces in the Vatican sandbox were visible but inaccessible in the base game.</p>



<p>As you explore the DLC, you'll find lots of clues and hints, similar to what we did in the base game, in all the Chapters. We have tons of notes for you to find and fill out Indiana's journal. There are around 70 new collectibles in the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> You can take this mission anytime in the campaign, really, even if you've already completed the game and you have a save and buy The Order of Giants DLC, you can still fast travel back here and start this mission, so there's no need to start a whole new game. As soon as you've gotten the camera and met Gina, you're good to go with the DLC.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> From the moment you enter the casina onward, everything is completely new content. At the beginning of the DLC's production, we thought we should reuse some stuff, but in the end, not much has been reused from the main game. Basically, everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new.</p>



<p><strong>So none of this is cut content from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Exactly, it's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game, but obviously, there were some things when we were working on the main game where we were already planning for this. The concept images and stuff like that. We knew that we were going to hopefully be able to dive deeply into this part of the narrative with The Order of Giants.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Everything is freshly built and you have no sensation of, like, oh, I've seen this before, this is just rehashed content from the main game. Everything is completely new. It's content that has been produced when we started to ramp down production on the main game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It was one of the big mysteries of the game, after all.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, so it's one of those nice opportunities to finally be able to actually do a DLC that dives a little bit deeper into the mystery of it.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We also have all-new puzzle mechanics. We are not recycling any of the old mechanics from other areas. There is a mix of big and small puzzles to get that balance between them.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> By the way, you can fast travel in and out of the DLC as you see fit.</p>



<p><strong>Is The Order of the Giants DLC harder than the base game when it comes to combat and/or puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> I think the puzzles lean towards being a little bit more difficult than the base game, actually, but of course, we still have hints. And we also still have the adventure mode if you want to have a simpler time in some of the puzzles. In terms of the combat, depending on where you are with the base game, the game will actually scale the difficulty. So, if you're starting right from the Vatican, it will be easier, but if you're in the endgame, the enemies will be more challenging.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> We will also be connecting the dots from certain narrative threads seen in the main game. Moreover, in terms of visual fidelity, everything that you'll see in the DLC is at a minimum as good-looking and polished as in the base game, and in some instances, it's even better. Similar to what we have in the main game as well, everything starts with a small mystery and then grows from there. In The Order of Giants, Father Ricci asks you to find the secret chamber and the giant helmet found within, but there's much more to it, so Indiana will have to keep digging.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> We have multiple larger puzzles like this one in the DLC, similar to the base game. There are a lot of layers and mechanics, new mechanics, and we're truly trying to push the player all around the environment. This is one of the brand-new mechanics that we started working on immediately after the base game wrapped up. In most Indiana Jones adventures, the puzzles that he unravels start with him figuring out the mechanics, and then once he gets into a good flow, something breaks, and he has to clear the breakage or do something else.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>What we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Did you incorporate any feedback from the players' experience with the base game into the design of these new puzzles?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah, we've watched a lot of players while they interact with our puzzles. I think what we heard from them is that they just wish there were more puzzles and also that they were more difficult. There were a lot of puzzles that we wished we could have made, so this was an opportunity for the team to take those ideas from the back of their mind, start putting them into the game, and try new things.</p>



<p>The designer who worked on this puzzle had an idea to rotate something with a wrench, and players could slot the wrench in and out. Then, another designer who had been working on the redirection maze for a while joined him to create this one.</p>



<p>One unique aspect of developing these puzzles compared to those from the base game is that they were finally done in our office. Most of those in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were made during COVID, when people were forced to work remotely. This is the first time the people could meet physically to design them.</p>



<p>There are more secrets to be found on the levels. Something that we've always tried to maintain is to allow for new paths to open, for new secrets to be revealed, so there's always this layering of the environments where you dig deeper and find something new, and depending on your playstyle, you may be able to find more stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> This traversal section is one that was just so super inspired. One of the designers who worked on this was someone who didn't do a big traversal section throughout the main game, but we had the opportunity to try a lot of new ideas with the DLC. Since the engine was in such a good shape that we had all the mechanics nailed down, it was easy for us to experiment and make new things without having to worry about bugs. This traversal scenario here, where you deal with pulleys and weights and moving up and down, shows off this brand new mechanics; it's a whole new way of using the whip.</p>



<p>This whole level here is like that. We started designing new mechanics and new features. We began by putting together a fresh view of mechanics with this rope and these pulleys. The designer had it in their mind, and I think they actually tried to do it a year or two ago, but only had the opportunity to make it work and get all the tech pieces in place for The Order of Giants DLC. When we first started doing this level design and walking it out, we actually found that it was getting longer, but people were having a lot of fun, so we increased the scope and the complexity of this whole scenario, just based on just internal player feedback. We felt it would be a missed opportunity otherwise.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have an estimate of the length of The Order of Giants DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter. But I've been playing through the final build back home in the studio and I think I'm at, like, four and a half hours, but then I know everything. Some of the puzzles can be very challenging even at medium difficulty, but that's why we also have easy difficulty available. If you don't want to spend too much time on puzzles, you should still be able to navigate through and continue the adventure. </p>



<p>I think it's important to emphasize that this is not a puzzle DLC. It's still primarily a story-driven narrative DLC. The balance here is similar to what we have in the base game: large puzzles, small puzzles, hard combat, light combat, cutscenes, set pieces, tense action, even some boss fight. Everything that was in the main game is represented in the DLC as well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>In terms of time spent, it's similar to a sandbox environment in the main game, so it's around 5 to 6 hours, but if you are a completionist and want to find everything, then I think it's more, and if you are a very skilled player who knows how to solve all the puzzles on first try, maybe it's shorter.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Basically, everything players loved about the base game, they're getting more of it.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yep. Exactly the same type of tone, sensation, same humor and everything. It's very much like an extension of the main game. I think that's something we felt was very correct to do, because we're still telling a new, standalone, unique adventure, a new story. But we saw so much feedback from the player community where people were like, we want more Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Finally, we had the opportunity to get the DLC out, which is just doing that. It's adding more to the beloved world of Indiana Jones.</p>



<p><strong>Earlier, you talked about the game's fidelity, which is already great. But I know that you are also improving upon it with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-hair-coming-september-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming RTX Hair update</a>. Can you talk about that a bit?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> I can't go into technical details, but what we're happy to see is that the development and integration of RTX Hair makes it so much better. Actually, there's a lot of things in the game that can benefit from it, because many things utilize the hair system, not just hair itself. It's a system that is used over other aspects as well. Everything that is fur or hair-related will have better render fidelity.</p>



<p>Some people may think it's a small thing, but there are all those small things that add up. The details and everything just make everything come together. We are really happy with the RTX Hair integration.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-nintendo-switch-2-release-order-of-the-giants-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a Switch 2 version</a>, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yeah, it will be released next year.</p>



<p><strong>Are you doing that internally, or is that work being outsourced?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Yes, most of the work is done internally. Our CTO, the engineers, and the programmers are working on it to ensure it is as good as we can possibly make it on a handheld platform.</p>



<p><strong>You already ported the previous Wolfenstein games to Nintendo Switch, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yes, both the last two Wolfenstein games. It's a continuation of Machinegames bringing the titles to Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Which is great. As a developer, you want to own as many as possible so that your game can be enjoyed, so we were very happy with the Switch 2 confirmation.</p>



<p><strong>One last question. Can you share whether there will be more of Gina in this DLC?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> Gina is not part of the DLC. This is more of Indiana Jones going on a little bit of a rogue adventure on the side. Gina is most likely still back undercover in the Vatican, doing some research at this point.</p>



<p>That was one of the reasons we wanted to really focus on Indiana Jones and the core of the IP to push him on a side quest. Obviously, we have a lot of sections in the main game where we do things together with Gina, which is nice because we want that balance. She's an important character, but we also see that it's cool when you're completely alone and you get the sensation that it's only up to you to solve the mystery, so it fits in within that balance too.</p>



<p><strong>Ezekiel Virant:</strong> Yeah. I think Indie is a bit distracted at this point and he wants to keep searching and pushing, whereas Gina is really on a beeline to find her sister.</p>



<p><strong>Axel Torvenius:</strong> In The Order of Giants DLC, you'll see Father Ricci, but there are also appearances of Father Ventura and Mussolini as well.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Based on what we played at Gamescom 2025, The Order of Giants looks like a thoughtful extension of what people (the undersigned included) already loved about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: awesome graphics, outstanding puzzles, and great atmosphere. There are also some interesting new platforming mechanics, too, especially those based around Indy's whip. The demo only featured a very brief combat scene, but according to the developers, fans should expect roughly the same split between combat, exploration, and narrative that made the base game so great.</p>



<p>There's not much to wait to experience the new content, with the DLC slated to hit all platforms on September 4. Look forward to our review soon. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision and Treyarch are making a big change to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, just under 12 weeks before its launch in November. All those wacky cosmetics from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry over to the new sequel as previously promised. The devs behind <em>Call of Duty</em> say the change is to ensure <em>Black Ops 7</em> is “authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">On August 26</a>, in a lengthy community update posted on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> website, Treyarch thanked fans for all the feedback and acknowledged the ongoing conversation online surrounding crossover skins and wacky cosmetic items in video games.</p> <p>“We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of <em>Call of Duty,</em>” said the studio. “Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made <em>Call of Duty</em> unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="COD x Beavis &amp; Butt-Head | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjaKA57mnu8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Players were worried that the weird cosmetics and crossover skins from <em>Black Ops 6</em> would immediately turn<em> Black Ops 7</em> into a <em>Fortnite</em>-like experience. That’s because the plan was to let skins from <em>BLOPS 6, </em>which now includes characters like Beavis and Butt-Head, carry over to <em>BLOPS 7</em>. But that’s no longer happening.</p> <p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,” announced Treyarch. <em>“Black Ops 7</em> needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why<em> Black Ops 6</em> Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to <em>Black Ops 7.</em> Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p> <p>The developers of <em>Black Ops 7</em> also claimed that a “ton of feedback” has already been implemented into the game. And the studio explained that future cosmetic bundles and items added to <em>BLOPS 7</em> will be “crafted to fit the <em>Black Ops</em> identity.” Treyarch further added: “We hear the feedback. We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core <em>Call of Duty</em> experience.”</p> <p>Activision did confirm that <em>BLOPS 6</em> skins will still move over to <em>Warzone</em>. So your strange collection of characters can still go enjoy battle royale.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/davy-x-jones-hands-on-preview-a-new-take-on-the-pirate-legend.1281087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, I had the opportunity to try out Davy X Jones, the latest IP from Polish studio Parasight, thanks to a special invite. Right from the start, it’s clear the team has a passion for reimagining legendary figures from human history—always with their own unique twist.</p>



<p>Their previous title, Blacktail, retold the tale of Yaga (yes, Baba Yaga) through Parasight’s narrative lens. In Davy X Jones, as the name suggests, we step into the boots of the infamous Davy Jones, who’s on a revenge-fueled quest against Blackbeard. After being killed, Davy’s head is separated from his body—creating a bizarre but brilliant duo of protagonists.</p>



<p>This split isn’t just for laughs (though the banter between head and body is genuinely funny); it also plays a key role in gameplay. The head performs specific actions, like devouring orbs that restore health, adding a clever layer to combat and exploration.</p>



<p>Speaking of combat, it channels the frantic energy of the DOOM franchise. Each of Jones’s arms wields a weapon—a bladed hook and a pistol. While the ranged mechanics felt solid, the melee system could use some refinement. At times, hits lacked impact. Thankfully, the game still has time to polish things up, thanks to the early access launch plan.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard was the difficulty. You need to stay on the move constantly, dodging and parrying enemy projectiles—or you’ll be dead in a few hits. Sadly, the demo didn’t include any scenes with Abby, the whale-ship that serves as the game’s hub and crew management area.</p>



<p>Progression systems weren’t showcased either, so I didn’t get a taste of how character upgrades or gear improvements work. Still, I walked away impressed. Having played Parasight’s previous work, I can confidently say Davy X Jones feels more refined across the board—even in its pre-release state. I’ll definitely be diving into early access when it drops on August 28.</p>

                <p>In an unexpected statement today, Activision made a dramatic announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">no longer allow</a> players to transfer any Black Ops 6 characters, weapons, or skins to Black Ops 7.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," the company said.</p><p>Activision added that Black Ops 7 developers Treyarch and Raven have been guided by the goal of making a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while at the same time "taking some big swings."</p><p>The company had previously said Black Ops 7 would included the franchise's Carry Forward feature that allows content from the past game to move forward to the next one. However, Black Ops 7 is doing away with this, and now, operators, skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p><p>"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the developer said. This only applies to Black Ops 7, as previous content will continue to carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement not long after Battlefield 6's big reveal, during which developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>The Call of Duty in-game store no doubt is a big-time money-maker, fueled in part by the kind of outlandish skins previous games have offered. It remains to be seen what kind of extra cosmetic content Activision will up-sell in Black Ops 7, or if the statement today will have any bearing on that.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta</a> begins in October. </p>

"I’m gonna say that again, to make it clear this isn’t just 'one of those things you say in a layoff message'. We TRULY wish we could keep every one of these people on the team. But we can't.

According to Brown, the team invested "heavily in creation tools across PC, VR, consoles, and mobile," but the reality "has been harsh." The CEO claims the mobile and console versions never got to the point where "those devices were good for building stuff."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/acclaim-announces-playacclaim-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%9990s-game-publisher-acclaim-is-back-from-the-dead-announces-new-playacclaim-showcase-in-september.1281042/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Acclaim, a US-based video game publisher who you'd recognize for its success in the 1990s with games like Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Turok, NBA Jam, and a suite of movie licensed games under its belt is <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">back from the dead</a> after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. The publisher is making a grand return with its own PlayAcclaim showcase series debuting in two weeks time, on September 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Titled "<em>A New Era is Coming</em>," this showcase is set to include the publisher's "<em>upcoming lineup of titles while celebrating the brand's unforgettable legacy</em>." There are even hints at what'll be revealed, and how Acclaim is going to kickstart its comeback, according to a press release, that eagle-eyed viewers can spot in the teaser trailer released today.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#PlayAcclaim Transmission Received: A New Era is Coming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Acclaim is now led by Alex Josef, who prior to being the chief executive officer of this new iteration of Acclaim was the chief executive officer of publisher <a href="https://www.graffitigames.com/">Graffiti Games</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We're not here to chase ghosts,</em>" Josef said in a press release. "<em>We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what's coming through is something exciting and different. You can't rewrite the past, but you can build upon it. This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh</em>."</p>



<p>Though this new iteration of Acclaim won't be publishing the Mortal Kombat games anymore, it'll be interesting to see what it adds to the modern videogame landscape, and for fans of the games the Acclaim used to publish, perhaps we'll see a few more series get a resurrection of their own. </p>



<p>We'll see what Josef and his team have in store in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-is-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6-to-release.1281036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta ended far too long ago already, and fans are chomping at the bit for more fast-paced, destructive action. Instead of waiting until October 10 to get their hands on Battlefield 6, hundreds of thousands of players are pouring into Battlefield 2042, sending the game rocketing back up the sales charts almost four years after launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 was a rocky title from day one, and for a while, it threatened to bring about the ‘end’ of the franchise. It has been a dark few years for Battlefield fans, and while Battlefield 6 is expected to be the savior of the series, Battlefield 2042 is finally getting a long-awaited moment in the sun.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-player-count-soars">Battlefield 2042 Player Count Soars</h2>



<p>Battlefield 2042 recently leapt up the charts on Steam, rocketing to 75,000 peak concurrent players and rivalling other top-tier shooters thanks to a) Battlefield 6 hype, and b) a staggering sale that dropped the game to record-low prices.</p>



<p>It was the highest peak player count Battlefield 2042 had secured on Steam <strong>since launch</strong>, provided you don’t count the free weekend in October 2023 that saw the game land 107,376 concurrent players.</p>



<figure><figcaption>That peak is really something (Source: SteamDB)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s safe to assume similar numbers are circulating on other platforms, particularly as Battlefield 6 draws ever closer.</p>



<p>In the most recent release of the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> newsletter, Battlefield 2042’s growth was studied by the team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 2042 <strong>sold almost 500,000 on Steam </strong>last week. While the hype for the imminent Battlefield 6 explains part of this, the real reason for its spike is a HUGE price drop, -95% to $2.99, its cheapest price yet on Steam.</p>



<p>EA often does massive fire sales like this on its legacy titles to give it revenues a boost ahead of its financials. The $1.4 million in Steam revenues from Battlefield alone is nothing to sniff at. Expect more at the end of Q3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s sad is that folks will be pouring into Battlefield 2042, perhaps expecting a similar experience to Battlefield 6, which many would have recently run through when the open beta was live. What they’ll be getting isn’t <strong>bad</strong>, but it’s not a patch on Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into Battlefield 2042 in anticipation of Battlefield 6? Or did you pick it up just because it’s cheap? Either way, let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that Skate will launch in early access three weeks from now on September 16, 2025, bringing years of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-pre-pre-pre-alpha-signups-insider-program-testing/">closed playtesting</a> and waiting to an end. It'll be available to download for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/">confirmed</a> that we'd get the early access release date announced and the game's cover art revealed today, with both arriving in a short trailer showing off some gameplay and introducing players to San Vansterdam.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="skate. | Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The fourth entry in EA's Skate series has been long-awaited, with 15 years between Skate 3's 2010 release and this new Skate game from Full Circle. Of course, it looks very different than the trilogy of games that skateboarding fans fell in love with between 2007-2010.</p>



<p>This new Skate is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">free-to-play live service game</a>, that will feature cosmetic microtransactions and require that <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players always be online</a> if they want to hop into San Vansterdamn. It's Skate for the modern video game landscape, or more accurately, it's the only iteration of Skate that EA believes is worth making in today's video game landscape, as EA ignores the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk remasters</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Skate is not just a return, it's a complete evolution of the franchise that's built to last,</em>" said the game's executive producer, Mike McCartney, in a press release. "<em>Our goal with Skate is to capture the freedom, creative expression and community of skateboarding, and share it with as many people as possible. From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future - one built in partnership with our players</em>."</p>



<p>While many players might not be on board with a Skate game that's potentially more focused on selling you a new colorway for your board than it is on making a good game, the fact that this is an early access release does at least mean, to some degree, Full Circle and EA will create the experience alongside player feedback. And, so long as Full Circle is able to nail the gameplay, you should be able to ignore all the live service filler you didn't ask for in your Skate game.</p>



<p>"<em>Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;</em><em>skate</em>," added the game's head of creative, Jeff Seamster. "<em>From day one, we've aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We've built this game alongside our community - listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you're a seasoned skater or just dropped in, Skate is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers - just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we're hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Skate's early access, free-to-play journey begins in a few weeks time. Hopefully, it's a strong enough start that we're not hearing about Skate being unceremoniously shut down in less than a few years time.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> modding group have just polished off a game jam in which they challenged themselves to recreate every singleplayer map in id Software's 1996 FPS from memory alone. That is, they were forbidden from replaying the original game before they started. As Slipseer user iLike80sRock puts it, "if somehow id1 was wiped off of all computers in the world, do we collectively remember the maps well enough to recreate them?"</p><!--more-->
<p>The Quake from Memory pack has been in the works since last year. Find the finished package <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-from-memory-full-release.487/">here</a>, with installation instructions. I don't know the original Quake well enough to comment on the accuracy of the results - I was naught but a sobbing child when Quake came out, and also, a hopeless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> enthusiast. Still, I'm very interested in the concept of this jam, because when we recreate things from memory, it <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/visual-memory-distortions.html">tends to reveal some kind of bias</a>. </p>
<p>The comments on that Slipseer thread run a fun gamut. Levels are "either uncannily spot on or butchered". Some rooms are too tall, perhaps because people remember being physically smaller when they played the game, and that difference in scale has somehow bled across the gap between simulation and the flesh. Some nail traps seem to fire too fast. Some maps "are very different in ways I can't explain in words".</p>
<p>There's a sense of fascination, throughout: it's not just people complaining that the Shamblers are the wrong way round. The premise of recreating the game from memory cultivates an intrigue and a generosity not typically found in responses to certain high-fidelity videogame remasters or remakes. </p><p>In the absence of lasting, external tangible records, such as writing, remembering becomes <a href="https://historyireland.com/recycling-the-dustbin-of-irish-history-the-radical-challenge-of-folk-memory/">more of a communal practice</a>. I'm interested to know if the Quake from Memory modders were allowed to show each other their work and compare reflections, or if each mapmaker had to go it alone. "Collectively" implies the former.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I've been trying to work out if I could recreate any of my favourite games from memory. Back in the day, I could have drawn most of Sonic 2's layouts by hand, but I have played a million games since, and that squiggly hedgehog lore is lost to me. I have sharper memories of G-Police, the cyberpunk flight sim from WipEout creators Psygnosis.</p>
<p>In particular, I have quite vivid memories of one mission in which you have to stave off base assaults while tracking down and obliterating an approaching land train. The time management rigours of that mission have drummed those dome cities into my head. Still, don't come crying to me if somebody manages to delete all surviving copies of G-Police. Missions 11-16 are just hypermissile whooshing noises on repeat.</p>
<p>Which game could <em>you</em> recreate from memory alone? Thanks to RPS reader Salty for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-346?view=comments">posting about this in the latest RPS wappity</a>.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and developers Full Circle announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">after years of waiting</a> and fans begging for a new game, the upcoming <em>Skate</em> reboot will launch in September in early access on consoles and PC.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372">On August 26</a>, EA posted a short trailer for the next <em>Skate</em> game, which is confusingly just titled <em>Skate</em>, and finally confirmed an early access release date. Previously, the publisher had teased that it would be out sometime this year and later promised it would be out this summer. But now we know that the new, online-only <em>Skate</em> reboot is launching on September 16. Mark your calendars and set aside some time to kickflip. Or crash. You’ll probably be crashing a lot.&nbsp; Here’s the new trailer:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are so hyped to announce that skate. will release in Early Access September 16th, 2025.

The game is set in San Vansterdam, a city built from the ground up by EA and Open Circle to be the dream playground for all skateboarders.</p> <p>It’s been a long wait for this new <em>Skate</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">EA first revealed it was working on a new <em>Skate</em> in 2020</a> after years of fans begging them to make it. Since then, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">leaked a few times</a>, and EA has put out early, unfinished footage of <em>Skate</em> as part of a plan to be more transparent about the open-world skateboarding game’s development. <em>Skate</em> has also been playtested by fans in the lead-up to its launch. The new <em>Skate</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears Activision and Call of Duty’s teams have listened to the community’s cries. It’s been revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t feature a Black Ops 6 carry forward. This would’ve seen cosmetics from BLOPS 6 be available in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-players-think-black-ops-6-purchases-carrying-over-to-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB summary hinted at Black Ops 6 purchases carrying over</a> into Black Ops 7. Despite claims that Call of Duty remains a realistic military shooter, this would’ve meant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, Squid Game, and various other novelty skins existing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This now appears to be off the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-won-t-feature-black-ops-6-carry-over-content">Black Ops 7 Won’t Feature Black Ops 6 Carry-Over Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I mean, what is this? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 26 news briefing on the Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> addressed the “Identity of Call of Duty.” It discussed Black Ops 7 being a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. However, the statement also recognized new changes that will be reflected in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,” is the front-page story here. Activision has decided against the planned carry-forward from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The statement continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward,&nbsp;because we recognize your time and progression are important. This change applies only to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Call of Duty:&nbsp;Warzone is not affected,&nbsp;and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can’t help but wonder if this is a response to Battlefield 6. EA and Battlefield Studios have already come out and said: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 likely won’t have unrealistic skins &amp; cosmetics</a>. In any case, the negative reaction to Black Ops 7 has more than likely alarmed Activision. We’ll have to see if the company caters to any more feedback moving forward.</p>

<p>What do you make of this bombshell? Is it the right call? Are we finally seeing the end of wild Call of Duty crossovers? Let me know what you think through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t making a comeback; it never left. LEGO Voyagers is the latest title to feature two-player-focused adventuring in a fantastical world you’re encouraged to explore. I had the opportunity to play it at Gamescom 2025. I also had the pleasure of talking to (and playing the game with) Karsten Lund, who revealed LEGO Voyager’s potential 5-hour length and other features in a special interview.</p>



<p>Karsten is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a>‘s senior quality manager. He graciously kept me company as we journeyed together through a succinct LEGO Voyagers demo. He had likely played the demo to death when Gamescom 2025 was all said and done. However, I conducted a one-to-one interview all about the LEGO Voyagers demo.</p>



<p>He was more than happy to answer several key questions I had about the game and gave us all a sneak peek at the game’s motives and content.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-is-something-everyone-s-ready-to-play">LEGO Voyagers is Something “Everyone’s Ready to Play”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We smashed it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Voyagers</a> doesn’t focus on a specific media license or property, or a talkative character with a riveting backstory. We care about two mute bricks who want to rescue a spaceship. Lund explained the dynamic and what the team wanted to achieve with Voyagers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This time around, we focus on the brick; figuring out a way to put brick and brick building as the star of the show as opposed to the minifigure-based games that are also out there. So in this game, you actually play as a LEGO brick, a small one-by-one brick with an eye. Then you have to navigate the levels that are completely brick-built as well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did mention recent contemporaries that have excelled in the genre—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a>‘ work, in particular. Karsten says that “the way has been paved now, right?” in (presumably) reference to the likes of It Takes Two and Split Fiction. </p>



<p>Furthermore: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s something everybody loves to play and everybody’s ready to play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Hazelight’s games, LEGO Voyagers supports the Friends Pass system. This means only <em>one of you</em> needs to buy the game to play it in co-op. Future content hinges on the game’s success. With it being an easy and accessible co-op LEGO release appealing to a wide demographic, this probably won’t be an issue.</p>



<p>I also enquired about the game’s length and if there are any fun mini-games to break up the gameplay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have a game of tic-tac-toe in the middle of the game, so we’re giving lots of opportunities to play and hang out in the game. We’ve seen players complete this in four and a half to five hours, if they just run through it and solve the puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I gave my full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers verdict in my complete Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, which I encourage you to check out!</p>



<hr>



<p>LEGO Voyagers is scheduled to release on September 15. Will you be picking it up straightaway? Do we need even more co-op games and fewer multiplayer-only titles?

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update.1280982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2006 Gears of War is the classic case of "don't judge a book by its cover;" this seemingly meatheaded, bro-forward game has cemented itself as not only one of the best third-person cover shooter series with its iconic gameplay and weapons, but also one that shrugs at its stereotypes to both embrace them (when was the last time you heard someone called a dickwad?) and defy them with great storytelling and fantastic voice acting. Ten years after its first makeover, it's gotten another with Gears of War: Reloaded. Unlike some games that get a premature remaster treatment a few years after their release, this one looks and feels like a noticeable improvement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we’ve come to expect from Xbox Game Studios developer The Coalition, the PS5 and Steam crowds are welcomed to the first game in this iconic series with gorgeous modern graphics and framerates, and no more waiting around on long load screens. Before we get into the details of Reloaded, here's what IGN said about Gears of War’s first remaster from 2015: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From playing about seven hours, I can say that the glowing review of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and its few faults still stand true with Reloaded. The story begins by throwing you into the thick of a losing war. Things go from shit to shittier for Marcus Fenix and crew as they try to accomplish one task that spirals out of control, and while that may not be fun for them, it sure is exciting to play, especially with the technical updates. Here are the highlights: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reloaded plays in 4K with up to 120Hz output (if you've got the screen for it). </li><li>The 60fps is a nice upgrade on consoles for the campaign, which previously only went up to 30fps at its launch and 60fps with the Series X performance boost, and 120fps in multiplayer is equally welcome.</li><li>There are more options to change up controls, audio, and more Reloaded than were in Ultimate Edition.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Touch of Color</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 Gears of War: Ultimate Edition did a great job upgrading the notoriously drab look of the Xbox 360 original with color adjustments, lifting the muddy grey and brown fog from the planet Sera. Reloaded takes that a step further, with an even more lively color palette and better lighting that resembles what we saw in Gears 5. The uplifted style gives extra vibrancy to splurting blood during a chainsaw kill, and the blue skies clouded by smoke and dust look nice, too. The Coalition added extra detail to the environment as well, like additional paintings in legal buildings, dense bookshelves, fridges with rotting food, more corpses, and other fitting decor like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Welcome to Delta Squad, PS5 </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still mighty odd seeing Xbox Game Studios on the screen while I hold a DualSense, but I can only say that the shredding of exclusivity lines hasn't hurt Gears of War one bit. If anything, it's made a strong case for me to do a co-op run on PlayStation 5. The core of Reloaded is the same between all three platforms, but the DualSense adds a twist with the adaptive triggers and any comms done through radio output through the controller's speaker. It was a neat surprise having dialogue and sound effects – like hitting the perfect active reload – presented this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the adaptive triggers can be off-putting in some situations, like when hopping on a Troika where the triggers feel like they're on max resistance for firing the turret or when driving a vehicle, so I could see them being unwelcome to some. I got tired of it in the second act during a long driving section, so I ended up turning adaptive triggers off for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Gears that's evolved over time is the heavy screen shake with the roadie run. It's less pronounced in other Gears games that’ve come along since, but The Coalition kept the exaggerated effect for Reloaded by default. I appreciate its unique touch and that the shakiness encourages tactical use. Running around an encounter isn't the way to play Reloaded, and if you do, you'll likely be punished for it. Instead, you'll want to run and bounce between cover, keeping yourself protected from the onslaught of enemy fire.  If you don't like screen shake, though, it can be turned off. It's good to have options! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Some Minor Bugs</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool additions are also joined by some minor bugs I’ve seen in the roughly six hours I’ve played on PlayStation 5. There was weirdness in checkpoints jumping me forward and facing a different way, characters’ voices would drop for a line randomly, and I saw some enemies get stuck in between cover. Those bugs have appeared infrequently and weren’t too bothersome, though, and are probably nothing a patch or two won’t fix. I didn't see these happen much during my time with the Xbox version, but just because I didn't see them doesn't mean they aren't there. Bugs are tricky like that!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bad Squad AI</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one actively annoying gameplay issues I came across was how incompetent and overall wonky my AI companions were on the Hardcore difficulty level, which is a noticeable downgrade from how they performed in Ultimate Edition. In Reloaded, they go down <em>constantly, </em>whereas in Ultimate Edition they still went down occasionally, but seemed to be helping more<em>.</em> Hardcore is only a step above normal and below Insane, so I expected they should be able to hold their own at least a bit. I noticed Dom waltzing into the dark and dying to the lurking Kryll that shredded him in seconds in one mission, and every now and then, Dom or the other two companions, Cole and Baird, would get stuck far behind, unwilling to leave a doorway. I love Delta squad, but I'm not reviving them every encounter only to put myself in danger.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cherry on Top: Extras for Gears Fans</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: Reloaded includes a nice Extras section, which is something you'd want to see in a remaster like this to reward returning fans who’re buying it for the second or third time. What'll interest most folks in the Extras section are the five different issues of the Gears of War comic. Grabbing the collectible COG Tags throughout the campaign unlocks pages in five different issues of the Gears of War comic, which is a nice reward for those who haven't read them. This was available in the Ultimate Edition, and it's a welcome return. Completing acts of the campaign also unlocks neat concept art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, while multiple sets of credits may not be what someone who’s new to this game cares about, for folks like me, seeing the credits available for Reloaded, Ultimate Edition, and the original are in line with Gears' respect for teamwork.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplayer Only Has Minor Tweaks</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer hasn't changed (in terms of what content is included) between Ultimate Edition and Reloaded, though The Coalition upgraded to 60Hz dedicated servers, as opposed to the 30Hz we’ve had in previous versions. The maps got the remaster treatment too, with better lighting, visual effects, and best of all, an upgrade to 120fps on consoles (PC players also get a 240fps option). I expect weapon tuning to be in flux after launch; The Coalition already noted it's making some improvements to the Gnasher, making perfect active reload damage fixed, and more tweaks based on feedback from the beta. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miranda's Top 10 Games of 2025</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Get Your COG Tags </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time playing Gears of War, I recommend finding a friend to join you – the Gears of War teams have always designed these games with a partner in mind (and as I mentioned, the AI doesn’t really pull its weight on the higher difficulty levels). The Coalition thankfully maintained the option to play Reloaded couch co-op, which we don’t see enough these days, and of course, you've also got the option of online crossplay if your co-op buddy is on another system. I'm still undecided on whether or not I want to spend my next co-op replay on Xbox or PS5 or bounce between them (thanks, cross-progression!), but I'm excited to dive back in again either way.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2021, Marvel Studios attempted to expand the reach of the MCU with an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">Eternals</a>, a lesser-known group of immortal heroes. Kumail Nanjiani was cast as Kingo alongside Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and more. Eternals didn't earn enough to merit a sequel, and Nanjiani has revealed that he had a deal for a video game and a theme park attraction that never came to pass.</p><p>"I signed on for six movies, you know," said Nanjiani during his appearance on Mike Birbiglia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Y8zwAj3sYpc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working It Out</a> podcast. "I signed on for a video game. I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign up for all this stuff ... And so you're like, 'Oh, this is the next 10 years of my life, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and then in-between I'll do like my own little things, whatever I want to do.' And then none of that happened."</p><p>That deal appears to have been predicated on Eternals being a hit like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which did get licensed out for video games and theme park rides. Marvel hasn't had a lot of video games based directly on the MCU movies in the last two decades, but the studio apparently kept the possibility open for Eternals.</p><p>Nanjiani previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-went-to-therapy-after-bad-reviews/1100-6520870/" data-ref-id="1100-6520870">disclosed that he went to therapy</a> after Eternals was greeted with bad reviews, but he told Birbiglia that the experience taught him that too much of his self esteem was tied up to other people's reactions to his work.</p><p>Eternals had $402.1 million worldwide, which is a threshold that Marvel Studios has had trouble reaching this year. Regardless, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-brings-adamantium-finally-references-eternals/1100-6525358/" data-ref-id="1100-6525358">the only Marvel movie to pick up on some of the threads introduced in Eternals</a> was Captain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Nanjiani also noted that he's proud of Eternals, and his experience with it has given him material for his latest standup comedy set.</p>

"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there."</p><p>Activision said double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward. "Because we recognize your time and progression are important," the developer explained.</p><p>Only a week ago, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-carry-forward-returns-for-black-ops-7-but-with-limitations/1100-6534013/" data-ref-id="1100-6534013">the Carry Forward program would return for Black Ops 7</a>, but not until some time after Season 1. The company said at the time there would be some exceptions, but now, it's not happening at all.</p><h2><b>The identity of Call of Duty has "drifted"</b></h2><p>In the statement today, Activision also acknowledged the conversations online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and how the perception from some is that Call of Duty has "drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place."</p><p>Activision said it understands that people want Call of Duty to be and feel "immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded."</p><p>"That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," Activision said.</p><p>The company did not, however, say what it's doing to address this beyond cancelling the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7. It appears Activision could be referencing the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for in recent years. Some part of the Call of Duty audience enjoys and embraces these skins, and others have said they are a detriment to the overall experience.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 backdrop</strong></h2><p>Activision is making these comments against the backdrop of Battlefield 6's release in October. Battlefield Studios has said it wants the game's multiplayer skins to feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-have-grounded-skins-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj/1100-6533627/" data-ref-id="1100-6533627">"grounded."</a></p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." That is seemingly a reference to the DLC skin for Call of Duty that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">lets you play as Minaj.</a> Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, producer Alexia Christofi said much the same thing, explaining that Battlefield Studios is hoping to make Battlefield 6's skins "feel grounded."</p><p>"We want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like, 'I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin,'" Christofi said. "But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. You can find highlights of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">new Black Ops 7 announcements</a> here, which includes details on an endgame for the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic look for multiplayer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>NASCAR 25</em>, has announced a multi-year partnership to bring a series of IndyCar games to PC and consoles, starting with an inaugural title next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.indycar.com/news/2025/08/08-26-iracing-console-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official IndyCar website, the open-wheel racing brand reveals that the first IndyCar title is due to land on PC and current-gen consoles in "the second half of 2026".</p>

<p>It'll mark the first IndyCar game since 2004's&nbsp;<em>IndyCar Series 2005</em>, which was developed by legendary racing studio Codemasters (which also had the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" rel="nofollow">taken away from it by Nacon</a> recently amid rumors of a shutdown).</p>

<p>iRacing president Tony Gardner says that IndyCar fans have "long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles", and that the studio's upcoming game will "offer all the excitement of the NTT IndyCar series and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy".</p>

<p>As for IndyCar's president J. Douglas Boles, he says that the IndyCar series is "the most competitive and challenging racing on the planet", and that as such, it "deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience".</p>

<p>You can expect a "robust, multilevel career mode" in iRacing's IndyCar game, as well as licensed drivers from the IndyCar series and Indy NXT. Naturally, the game will also support online multiplayer to help you prove your racing dominance around the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-outlaws-dirt-racing-indycar-iracing.jpg?itok=K5v35BrD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-outlaws-dirt-racing-indycar-iracing.jpg?itok=9GyDNTKq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know iRacing's name from&nbsp;<em>World of Outlaws: Dirt Racing</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This upcoming IndyCar title will be the first in a series of games, with iRacing's parent company iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations and IndyCar signing a partnership "long term" for the flagship <i>iRacing&nbsp;</i>simulation as well.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more about IndyCar and iRacing's collaboration in the months to come, so stay tuned for more. When it launches, it's due on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it looks like it'll support Steam Deck as well.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts is preparing to welcome gamers to San Vansterdam from September 16 as Skate (I’m not writing skate., I hate that title) enters early access. This news was announced on social media earlier today, and it comes after months of closed testing phases have unravelled much of the game’s content.</p>



<p>The Skate team also released a short trailer to celebrate the announcement. It has been more than 15 years since the last Skate game was released, and fans are <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-will-release-in-early-access-next-month">Skate Will Release in Early Access Next Month</h2>



<p>In little more than two weeks, Skate will be released in early access by Electronic Arts. Earlier today, the team posted a small trailer to announce the release date:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For months, fans have been testing Skate (stylized as skate.) and running the game through its paces. This has meant that stacks of content have emerged online, giving us a fair indication of what to expect when San Vansterdam opens up on September 16, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the team revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-skate-game-gets-official-cover-art-and-early-access-release-date-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover art for Skate</a>, promising that the early access release date would drop <strong>today</strong>. Well, as you can see from the above, they’ve delivered on that promise.</p>



<p>In June, the biggest update ever made to the playtest product was unveiled, adding more challenges and upping the server limit to 150 players per map. Even in a testing state, Skate featured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-skate-playtest-update-revealed-wishlists/">a whopping 140 challenges</a> and activities.</p>



<p>The full game could end up being something pretty monumental, scale-wise.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Skate when it enters early access on September 16? Let me know what you’re most excited about with this game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: When Did The IndyCar Deal Come Together With iRacing?]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Tuesday, it was announced that iRacing and IndyCar had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-game-coming-in-2026-from-iracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> on a new game for the second half of 2026. The first console game in over 20 years for IndyCar, this new title is planned to launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. </p>



<p>But when did the deal come together? </p>



<p>Back in early 2024, iRacing president Tony Gardner <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-not-planning-an-indycar-console-game-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Insider Gaming</a> that an IndyCar console game wasn’t in a “short-term plan” for the company, but that the door was open. Later that year, the door blew wide open.</p>



<p>Gardner says that while the long-term plan was <a href="https://iracingstudios.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to eventually get here</a>, talks really picked up in late 2024.</p>



<p><strong>“We finalized an agreement with them early this year,”</strong> Gardner told Insider Gaming, <strong>“So, it was six to nine months ago and, and we didn’t want to announce it too soon because we’d rather get some development under our belt and whatnot.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why announce the game now, Gardner said it made sense to do it ahead of the final race of the 2025 season on August 31. </p>



<p><strong>“We need to to start talking more openly to the teams and getting driver feedback on the physics and things like that,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So it’s a good time for us to let the cat out of the bag.</strong>“</p>



<p>In addition to the console game, iRacing will continue to have a relationship with IndyCar on its main platform. The game is <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-development-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to add</a> the Dallara IL-15 from the INDY NXT series is set to join iRacing in season 4 of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/lumines-arise-is-a-brand-new-entry-in-the-series-showcasing-everything-the-team-learned-on-tetris-effect/">Lumines Arise&nbsp;</a>was first announced back in June during Sony’s State of Play, marking a new entry into the Lumines series. Today, Enhance Games has released a new limited time demo for Lumines Arise on PS5 and PC via Steam, allowing players get a first taste of the game. The limited window to experience the Lumines Arise demo lasts from today until September 3rd. After that, players will have to wait for the now confirmed release date of November 11th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Demo Explainer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_s7uLivr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Lumines Arise demo will feature three stages, with those being Arise, Duo Soul, and Chameleon Grove, along with the multiplayer mode of Burst Battle. The Burst feature is indicated by a percentage score that increases as you play, and when it hits 50% or 100% you can activate it. Activating Burst means a shift in how Lumines plays. Instead of blocks clearing when the line passes through them, you will build up blocks to grow the Burst area. The aim is for you to clear as much of the area as possible when the timer expires. In the multiplayer Burst Battle, garbage builds up making the playing area smaller and smaller, but activating burst stops the garbage falling for a time. You want to be able to build up your score and use the Burst at the opportune moment to beat your opponents. To grab the Lumines Arise demo, head to the following links.</p>

</ul>
<p>The last game Enhance released was Tetris Effect, and in our review we gave it a 10/10 saying, “<em>There’s a point when you’re playing Tetris and everything else seems to fade away. Tetris Effect takes that one step further by bringing the game to PSVR alongside its regular 4K HDR presentation, where the closed circuit of headset, player and controller is the only reality. In the main Journey mode – a collection of stages strung together in a series of EP-like sets – you’re still attempting to remove lines from the playing field by fitting shapes together, but when you combine the low latency response of the PSVR’s screens, the ever-changing visuals and wire yourself up to the music, Tetris Effect’s heady melody of the physical and the experiential offers one of the most compelling arguments for virtual reality yet.”</em></p>
