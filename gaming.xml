                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its colorblind simulation tool</a>, Chroma, to the general public after several years in development. It's available to check out over on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/UbiChroma" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Github</a>.</p><p>In the announcement, Ubisoft explained that there are an estimated 300 million people across the globe who are impacted by colorblindness. Chroma's purpose is to simulate the three major colorblindness types: Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia.</p><p>Ubisoft also said that its quality-control team in India started developing Chroma in 2021. The team wanted to create a tool that could provide real-time feedback so developers could simultaneously control the game and simulate colorblindness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png" data-ref-id="1300-4476672" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png" data-ref-id="1300-4476672"></a><figcaption>Chroma in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png"></figure><p>Now that it's open-source, developers simply have to apply a filter over the game screen  and it can simulate live gameplay up to 60fps. Chroma utilizes the Color Oracle algorithm and is compatible with single and dual screens. It also works with hotkeys and has a customizable overlay.</p><p>"Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind," said Ubisoft QC product manager Jawad Shakil. "Open-sourcing Chroma is a proud step forward, allowing everyone to benefit from this innovation."</p><p>Ubisoft isn't the only large developer aiming to make accessibility available to the general public. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-just-made-two-accessibility-patents-open-source/1100-6528289/" data-ref-id="1100-6528289">Electronic Arts made two of its patents open-source</a>. One of them was a speech-based patent that made it easier for players' speech to be recognized and reflected in-game. The other was an Unreal Engine 5 plugin called IRIS, which automatically alerts developers to moments in their games that could cause seizures in players with photosensitive epilepsy.</p>

            <p>
For years now I have watched Haenir's putrid action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blight-survival">Blight: Survival</a> like a miasmatic knight errant squinting through the bushes at a peasant-shaped mushroom. I reached out to the devs for an interview a while ago, and received no reply. I wasn't hugely surprised by their silence: Blight began life as a two-person project, and is a long way from release. Still, there's been some ominous movement of late: the developers have unveiled a new biome and enemies, and are now fielding applications for very limited closed playtesting.

<p>
In Blight: Survival, you and up to three chums roam a squelching hinterland between two warring kingdoms. The conflict has bred a noxious brainrot that has reduced the resident villagers to sporing undead. There are also enemy soldiers to worry about, busily farming the wreckage. You're a graverobber yourself, siphoning gear from the battlefield by means of "mechanics inspired from rogue-lites and extraction games". Your higher goal is to reach and obliterate the source of the Blight. I'd have thought persuading the opposing kingdoms to stop spilling blood everywhere would have been the place to start, but this is a video game.
</p>

<p>
I will not say that Blight looks like High Art. I will not say that it courts thematic complexity. It is about hiking through the flyblown boondocks, murdering reanimated shepherds with a longsword. I don't get the sense that any particular commentary on any particular war is being offered. Still, within its stinking parameters, it ticks a number of boxes for me. Firstly, "directional combat", with players angling their sword to swing or parry. Directional combat is often horribly implemented, or treated as a source of comedy, but it worked in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> and it mostly works in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and I'm always drawn to the concept, because I like to feel like I'm literally hefting a sharpened metal stick. To get a sense of it, check out the reveal trailer from 2022.

<p>
Secondly, Blight has some appreciably nasty swamp environments, full of chopped chapels and gibbet trees. It makes me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, but there's some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> here and probably some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as well. I enjoy when games commit to being a swamp level, inasmuch as this is purposefully and viciously alienating a section of your audience in advance. I'm hoping the landscapes will be as enveloping as they seem, with plenty of opportunities to get lost. "Will you go back and secure your spoils or risk it all and push forward?" offers the Steam page. "How far are you willing to go?" That very much depends on whether I've got dinner on, Haenir. When I'm playing an extraction-style game the critical factor is whether the average round lasts longer than it would take a pot of pasta to cook.
</p>
<p>
Haenir's puny ranks have recently been swollen by "several dozen full-time developers" from publisher Behaviour Interactive, including "level designers, narrative writers, programmers, UI/UX devs, concept and VFX artists, animators, sound designers, QA testers, directors, producers, and more". I'm a bit leery of Behaviour, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">recent mass layoffs and closures</a>, but Blight's sweaty skirmishing feels like a decent fit for the creators of Dead by Daylight. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774880/view/545603039390598280?l=english">Read more in the latest Steam blog post, including details about the forthcoming playtests</a>. Release date as yet the game hath none.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">Horror</a> is escaping a melted flesh abomination, but to pull off true terror, you need to have a gleefully murderous human get right up in my face and grin about whatever nasty human stuff they're planning to get up to. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/agni-village-of-calamity">Agni: Village Of Calamity</a>, an Indonesian survival horror that looks interesting for its early Resident Evil influences, but has gotten stuck in my head for specifically evoking Resident Evil 7's intimate human threat.

<p>It's that claustrophobic camera work that's drawn me in. I have to admit I've become so spoiled by indie survival horror of late that I've grown slightly numb to the sort of things that used to excite me. Fixed camera angles. Limited inventory space. I blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a> for being so excellent. But Agni feels deliberate, rather than overly reverent to its influences.</p>
<p>Agni is your character. She's an Indonesian cop who's gone rogue to explore a remote village. Not a remote village, Agni! That's where the bad things happen. I'm especially fond of how the setting allows for more lush and distinct greenery than you might expect from this genre. Not enough vibrant fronds in survival horror, as a rule.</p>
<p>"Throughout the journey, Agni grapples with guilt, fear of abandonment, and unresolved trauma from her past," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151360/Agni_Village_of_Calamity/">Steam</a>, leaning into Silent Hill-isms. "Her perilous journey tests her resolve as she confronts her inner demons while striving to find out what happened and find her missing partner".</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/DYPsXgQHsGk">13 minute gameplay video</a> available besides the trailer. Agni explores an abandoned house with her trusty lighter, strolls past some mannequins (pointing out the tired trope herself, which doesn't absolve you, game), and eventually has to run as they come to life. Again, it's the focus on Agni's own reactions during cinematics that I feel is the strongest part here, lending everything an off-kilter indie cinema slant I'm very drawn to.</p>
<p>Things get progressively strange, but I'll leave that for you to discover on your own. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Barely two weeks after A Minecraft Movie was released, a sequel was demanded by the rabid fanbase. It honors the franchise and brings Minecraft to life in ways never thought possible, and if a sequel does happen, you’d have to think it would be as big a smash hit.</p>



<p>Jack Black, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jason-momoa-promotes-minecraft-movie-by-saying-he-doesnt-let-his-kids-play-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, and co. had the difficult task of bringing to life one of the most successful franchises of all time. Minecraft has earned billions from game sales, merchandise, and much more. But A Minecraft Movie is a different beast. It hasn’t disappointed moviegoers who helped the movie earn over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its first weekend</a>.</p>



<p>Its success has grown daily, fueling speculation of a successor. We’ve got the latest on a new movie, and whether this is becoming a fully fledged film franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-status-explained">Will There Be A Minecraft Movie 2? Sequel Status Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, buddy. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to an interview, plans for A Minecraft Movie sequel are “imminent.”</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/warner-bros-mike-de-luca-pam-abdy-courage-in-face-of-brutal-press-coverage-1236366618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> interviewed Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy from Warner Bros. about the future of A Minecraft Movie and the potential for a sequel. When queried about the plans for a Minecraft sequel, De Luca had this to say: <strong>“Imminently. The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.”</strong></p>



<p>This comes days after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film’s director, Jared Hess, said</a>: “He would have a blast doing the sequel.” He said there were many ideas and concepts they couldn’t fit into this film, so it makes for a sequel to follow and to include a lot more of the source material that didn’t make the cut the first time around.</p>



<p>An imminent sequel is hardly a surprise given the overwhelming success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-be-about">What Could A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel be About?</h2>



<p><strong>There are still many new characters, enemies, and ideas that could be introduced in A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel, but the end of the original film gives away some big details.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Alert—I’m about to briefly discuss what happens after the credits roll in A Minecraft Movie. You have been warned.</strong></p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits cutscene to prolong its runtime</a>. In it, Steve turns up at a house with the hope of going into the attic. We find out the house belongs to a person named Alex—who Minecraft fans will instantly recognize.</p>



<p>We don’t know if this is a mini one-off for Alex or if they could feature heavily in a sequel. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

<p>We hope you’re enjoying A Minecraft Movie, and listening to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclaimer about not throwing popcorn</a>.

            <p>Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure? Having been announced in 2017, the game finally released in February of last year after numerous delays and setbacks. However, Skull and Bones failed to make positive waves on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">players calling out the underwhelming gameplay and poorly designed end game</a>, among other gripes.</p>
<p>Since its release, Skull and Bones has pretty much fallen off the radar, to be honest. At the time of writing, the game currently boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/">221 players on Steam</a>, and while that is obviously not a complete overview (the game released on other platforms, as well) it still isn't an especially auspicious number .</p>
<p>But despite all this, Ubisoft is still updating Skull and Bones (perhaps tinkering away with the engine and such while it gets ready for the yet-to-be-announced, but much desired and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">heavily rumoured piratical remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a>).</p>

<p>Last night, Skull and Bones' team released patch notes for the first season of the game's second year, known as Ascent into Chaos. This new season kicks off today, 15th April, and includes things like a new ship (a Schooner), a new status effect (Shell-Shocked), new upgrade tree and a new pet in the form of a tiger cub.</p>
<p>Item Ascension will also arrive this season, with the accompanying lore blurb reading:</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean is set ablaze by the war between the Megacorporations, with each side looking to gain an advantage over the other by using increasingly powerful weapons. The origins of these ascended weapons remain a mystery, but what is known is that acquiring them may be vital to surviving the coming onslaught."</p>
<p>You will need to have made your way up to Infamy Tier 9 at a minimum to be able to make use of Item Ascension. When you reach this, though, you can expect to recieve some mail which will enable you to begin the Ascension and Modification quest. Once you do that, you will then need to pop over to  the Blacksmith to unlock the Item Ascension feature.</p>
<p>There are three modification grades, Ubisoft explains. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic - General improvements</li>
<li>Advanced - Noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>Special - Powerful improvements with unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Modification Slots, meanwhile, are assigned based on the weapon rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common - 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Uncommon - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Rare - 2 Basic, 1 Special</li>
<li>Epic - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced</li>
</ul>

<p>In an accompanying Skull and Bones: Year 2 Showcase video, senior community developer Alexis Cretton thanked the game's community, adding Ubisoft was "committed to support Skull and Bones for years ahead".</p>

<p>On its release last year, our Matt complimented Skull and Bones' "beautiful world" and "bombastic ship-to-ship combat". However, he was less enamoured with the game's boring busywork and tedious traversal.</p>
<p>As he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">wrote in Eurogamer's two star Skull and Bones review</a>: "No game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While The Last of Us Part II Remastered doesn't really need ray tracing to look good, features like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion would really bring the game's visuals to the next level, judging from a new video shared online a few hours ago.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by Beyond Dreams, shows the recently released PC version of the game running with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ray tracing mod</a> powered by the Complete RT shader, the most advanced ray tracing shader available to date, and a custom Reshade preset that introduces improved global illumination, ambient occlusion, color grading, dynamic depth of field, and other enhancements. As highlighted at the beginning of the 8K resolution video below, the differences are massive and significantly enhance the game's visuals in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1164477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-gamestop-stores-will-have-100-switch-2-units-at-launch-its-claimed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new claim, most GameStop stores expect to have abundant Nintendo Switch 2 console units at launch.</p>



<p>The new claim comes from Nintendeal on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911810754099249648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-nsw2-united-states-preorder-stock-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), stating that according to their sources, most GameStop stores are expecting “100 Switch 2 consoles available at launch.” However, games and accessories will be “extremely limited.” Players have questioned whether 100 units are an ample amount to meet the demand, to which the source <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811154672029943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied</a>, “100 consoles at launch in each store is…. a lot more than basically any console launch ever.”</p>



<p>Along with Nintendo Switch 2 units at GameStop, players wondered if Best Buy would have a similar amount of stock. Nintendeal <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1911811597091377666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> that they have not heard anything from Best Buy sources; however, “the general consensus is that the console itself will not be difficult to acquire.”</p>



<p>Ever since it was announced, players have wondered about the supply of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. Nintendo also recently delayed pre-orders in the US “to assess the potential impact” of the tariffs. However, if the source is accurate, it seems the company will be well prepared for the console’s launch. Nintendo will use a pre-order invite system on My Nintendo Store for the Switch 2, and the invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. </p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Switch 2s manufactured in China could be subject to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2s-manufactured-in-china-reportedly-subject-to-145-us-tariff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">145% US Import Tariffs</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

            <p>Video games can be an expensive hobby, but how much money have you actually spent? Steam has you covered.</p>
<p>Buried away in the help section of Valve's PC game platform is a page called External Funds Used, which provides a total of all your expenditure.</p>
<p>It's not a new page, but it is hard to find and certainly proves interesting once you know it exists. Users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1jycup7/comment/mmxdv4f/">reddit</a> recently explained how to find it (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/steam-total-account-spend/">PC Gamer</a>), though whether you want to is up to your discretion.</p>
<p>If you're intrigued, head over to: help &gt; steam support &gt; my account &gt; data related to your steam account &gt; external funds used.</p>
<p>Funds are listed under different categories, though TotalSpend is the big one. OldSpend is for funds applied before April 2015, PWSpend is for players whose accounts are linked to Perfect World for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and ChinaSpend is funds applied from China.</p>
<p>Steam hosts regular sales, but even with big discounts they're likely responsible for a high proportion of sales when they come around.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-every-single-steam-sale-event-planned-for-2025">Valve confirmed all the Steam sales planned for 2025</a>. Next up will be the Sokoban Fest from 21st - 28th April, followed by Wargames Fest from 28th April - 5th May.</p>
<p>The biggest, though, will be the Steam Summer Sale, running from 26th June - 10th July.</p>
<p>In other Steam data news, Valve released its Steam Hardware and Software Survey in March, which revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/50-of-all-steam-users-in-february-were-chinese-speaking">Chinese-speaking users now account for half of the entire userbase</a>.</p>
<p>The platform also has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">new feature that warns users of potentially abandoned early access games</a>.</p>
<p>Have you checked your total spend? Were you surprised?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is estimated to be more powerful than the Xbox Series S but less powerful than the base PlayStation 5, and won't be able to run PS5 games as well as the original system does due to lower memory bandwidth.</p>
<p>Following up on some <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/">earlier comments</a> regarding the portable edition of the next-generation Sony console, known leaker Kepler L2 provided some additional information on the system on the NeoGAF forums. Asked about the system's power, the insider confirmed that, while it won't be as powerful as the base current-generation system, it will definitely be able to<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> run PS5 games</a>, although not at the same resolution and framerate, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth. Judging from this information, the leaker's assessment of the system's power, which will sit between the Xbox Series S and the base PlayStation 5, sounds accurate enough, although they <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> how it's difficult to estimate the system's performance due to it using an unreleased GPU architecture.</p>
<p>Speaking further about the portable PlayStation 6 SoC, the leaker confirmed it will be a different chip than the one powering the home console, designed to run at very low voltages, and that will feature <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270322851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot less than 40 compute units</a>, so likely less than the 36 featured by the base PlayStation 5's chip, although this doesn't tell us much without any additional information. This SoC will also tape out <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/post-270323166" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few months after the regular PlayStation 6 SoC</a>, so it may take a while longer for more information to come out.</p>
<p>While any edition of the PlayStation 6 has yet to be announced, we know that it will be powered by AMD like its two immediate predecessors. This wasn't a given, however, as Intel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">reportedly</a> bid to produce the system but ultimately lost to AMD. The system is expected to be released between 2027 and 2028.</p>

<p>The PS6 Portable claims have been updated with more information, clarifying that the handheld will be able to run PS5 games with a scaled-down experience. </p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-can-run-ps5-games-at-a-lower-resolution-and-frame-rate">PS6 Portable Can Run PS5 Games At a Lower Resolution and Frame Rate</h2>



<p>Yesterday, information about a next-gen PlayStation 6 (PS6) Portable surfaced online, with KeplerL2 claiming that the portable version of the upcoming console <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be as powerful</a> as the PS5 and the handheld features “a 15w SoC on 3nm.” Today, the user has clarified on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-5#post-270323192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NeoGaf</a> (via r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jzjjef/kepler_clarifies_that_the_portable_ps6_can/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>) that the PS6 Portable “can definitely run PS5 games, just not at the same resolution/FPS, mainly due to lower memory bandwidth.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-ps6-portable-probably-falls-between-xbox-series-s-and-ps5">PS6 Portable Probably Falls Between Xbox Series S and PS5</h2>



<p>KeplerL2 has also provided context about where the PS6 Portable would stand against the current-gen consoles. The leaker thinks that in terms of performance, “it’s somewhere between the XSS (Xbox Series S) and PS5.” However, they clarified that it’s hard to know for sure as it’s “using an unreleased GPU uarch.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>KeplerL2 also spoke about the regular PS6 SoC, explaining that it differs from the portable SoC and “[Redacted] is specially designed to run at very low voltages”. KeplerL2 added that the portable PS6 chip has “a lot less than 40” CUs (compute units).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from official Sony channels, so take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increasing the price</a> of the PS5 in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>[<strong>Update</strong>] The first screenshots of the Oblivion remake have now leaked online via Virtuos Official website, as reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>. You can find screenshots that will most likely accompany the game's reveal trailer, including some <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comparisons</a> that highlight the visual improvements featured in the remake, and the confirmation of the official name of the project, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, by scrolling down <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">here.</a></p>
<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The long-rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is going to be shadowdropped in a few days, according to a very reliable insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on yesterday's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giant Bomb</a>'s GameBreaking News, reliable insider Jeff Grubb, who correctly provided information before official announcements multiple times in the past, provided an update on the rumored remake of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, saying that it will be shadowdropped next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Prices Increasing in Some Regions | GameBreaking News 04/14/25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0_ONk_GmF-Q?start=2238&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that the Oblivion remake&nbsp;<span>will be released towards the end of April. Just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week</a>, another reliable insider, NateTheHate, suggested that the game would be released close to April 21st, so at this point, there's a very high chance one of the worst-kept</span>&nbsp;gaming secrets of the year will indeed be released in a week or so.</p>
<p>The Oblivion remake, or rather remaster as it was called at the time, was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">2023</a> during an FTC investigational hearing with Xbox head Phil Spencer. The game, however, was never acknowledged in any official capacity, and its scope has likely changed since its unofficial reveal, as it is said it will be a full-blown remake powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, which will also include some gameplay changes besides improved visuals. Thankfully, it seems like it won't be long until we finally learn how the classic RPG will have been changed for its new release.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developers of post-apocalyptic shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2: Heart Of Chornobyl</a> have shared a roadmap for future updates, promising new guns, smarter foes, and a helpful development kit for modders. Among the changes is good news for anyone frustrated after pumping their entire backpack of bullets into 30 to 50 feral hogs. Murderised mutants will now drop loot of some kind, instead of offering no reward at all.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>We're not told what kind of loot they'll drop, but in the developer's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/572627883580720125">roadmap post on Steam</a> there's a little picture of a tooth scribbled next to the note "mutant loot". So probably lots of handy gizzards and guts. Currently, when you kill a mutant, their corpses are simply empty. This is unlike defeated human foes who can be ransacked for bullets, food, and boots. This means that a series of mutant encounters can quickly drain your ammunition stocks. Especially when it comes to the spongier beasts. And getting nothing back after firing all that precious ammo into hides can feel frustrating to some.</p>
<p>Like I say, it's not the only upcoming change. The developers listed their other priorities for the next three months in the post. Smarter enemy and ally AI are high on the list, with "better cover/flanking use" and "limited grenades". Mutants will soon eat fallen victims if all goes to plan, and will "react to threats". There will also be two new weapons, we're told, alongside widescreen support and "further stabilization".  </p>

 </a>
<figcaption>I got nothing for killing this? What a boar. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/GSC Game World</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another item on the list is a beta for a planned "ModKit". While there are already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-bulletsponge-mutants-can-be-nerfed-with-this-handy-mod-saving-you-precious-rounds">plenty of handy mods</a> for Stalker 2 (including one that already adds <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389">mutant loot</a>), this SDK will come packaged with a guide and might make modders' lives a little easier. The devs are also planning to set up Steam Workshop support, so players can add mods easily from there. </p>
<p>These plans might change, say GSC Game World in a flavoury disclaimer scribbled at the bottom of the stained note: "Mission targets may be moved from Q2 to later dates in case of Zone instability." </p>
<p>Stalker 2 launched in a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-is-out-now-and-buggy-as-hell-but-the-developers-are-already-planning-fixes">very buggy state</a> but was well-received despite the jank. In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">Stalker 2 review</a> James called it "a captivating survival shooter, even with bits falling off". Soon after the radioactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> came out, the developers admitted that some important features, such as the "A-life" simulation of patrolling squads, were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-devs-insist-complex-ai-simulation-of-enemy-patrols-is-in-the-game-its-just-broken">simply broken</a>. But they've been routinely and reliably patching things since then, with the latest significant batch of fixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-latest-patch-once-again-comes-with-four-figures-worth-of-fixes-and-improvements">landing last month</a>. </p>
<p>James also once became <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beastmaster-of-stalker-2-part-one-how-to-make-friends-and-eviscerate-people">a beastmaster with lots of mutant minions</a> in the game. I wonder how he feels now his "friends" will soon become skinnable loot rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a long time coming, but A Minecraft Movie has finally creeped up on 2025 and delivered the goods. It’s raking in hundreds of millions of dollars, and if you’re looking to see it yourself, we can tell you how long it is and if you need to stick around for a post-credits scene.</p>



<p>Video game movies and TV are as popular as they’ve ever been. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-viewership-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> has captivated TV audiences, whereas animated blockbusters like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Mario. Bros Movie</a> has lit up the silver screen. It’s the turn of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>, and the big-screen adaptation of the block-building bonanza.</p>



<p>Depending on what you read and who you trust, Minecraft is the <strong>first or second-best-selling game in history</strong>—putting a lot of pressure on the movie’s shoulders. It’s doing well, and despite people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">throwing popcorn at every screening</a>, it bodes well for a sequel. Here are the crucial details if you need to see A Minecraft Movie first.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-minecraft-movie">How Long is A Minecraft Movie?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t say it… Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Minecraft Movie has an official runtime of 101 minutes.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve ever been to the theater yourself, you know you won’t be in your seat for 101 minutes. This means the official runtime of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-minecraft-movie-out-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a> from the opening stills to the final frame of the credits is approximately 101 minutes (or 6,060 seconds).</p>



<p>However, factor in eating your popcorn before the film starts, a few minutes waiting for the lights to go down, sitting through adverts and a few helpings of new movie trailers, and the overall experience is probably closer to <strong>120 minutes / 2 hours</strong> or a bit longer.</p>



<p>Let’s see if a post-credits scene accounts for the movie’s minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-a-minecraft-movie-have-a-post-credits-cutscene-no-spoilers">Does A Minecraft Movie Have a Post-Credits Cutscene? (No spoilers)</h2>



<p><strong>There is a post-credits scene in A Minecraft Movie, meaning you should stick around until the very end.</strong></p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to disclose the nature of the scene. It’s a nice bit of fan service for Minecraft lovers. But I will say the scene lasts <strong>roughly 25 seconds</strong>, so you don’t need to hang around for too long once it begins.</p>



<p>It could have potential implications for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored sequel</a>, so I’d say it’s worth watching. Plus, it doesn’t hurt to give everyone involved in the production the credit they deserve!</p>

			<p>Evolution comes slowly in nature, but in technology it can often come all at once.&nbsp;Since Atari proliferated the joystick, and Nintendo got the D-Pad right on the first go, we’ve got used to the status quo of how we interact with our games over the past fifty years. Now though, Victrix are bringing evolution to the arcade stick, by… getting rid of the stick.</p>
<p><iframe title="Victrix™ Pro KO™ Leverless Fight Stick by Turtle Beach®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ld7W4CUzCsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to rewrite your brain? That’s what using the Victrix Pro KO Leverless feels like if you’re coming to it after years of using a regular arcade stick. Like the deeply unusual <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/22/azeron-cyborg-gaming-keypad-review/">Azeron Cyborg</a>, Victrix are rewriting how we interact with games. Leverless sticks have been around for a while, but this is their first true foray into the mainstream thanks to Victrix’s newfound role as one of Turtle Beach’s subsidiaries.</p>


<p>The Pro KO Leverless Fight Stick has an RRP of £229.99 and comes in one colour scheme: black. While our review unit was an Xbox Series, Xbox One and PC compatible edition, there’s also a PS5/PS4/PC-flavoured one as well. In the box is the unit itself, a 3-metre braided cable in Victrix’s trademark purple, a fabric carry bag with the Victrix logo, and a breakaway USB-C adaptor to prevent any unwanted mishaps when someone trips over your cable.</p>
<p>One of the most surprising things when you first take the Pro KO Leverless out of the box is just how slim it is. With a super slim profile, it’s vastly thinner than Victrix’s headline Pro Arcade line or indeed any other major fight stick on the market. Despite its size, there’s still a decent heft to it, which you can probably attribute to the anodised aluminium body.</p>


<p>The underside is wholly covered by a chunky rubber grip plate, once again in vibrant Victrix purple, and there’s then a series of release catches so you can pop the top plate off to reveal the inner workings of the stick. It’s worth noting that the underside is more or less completely flat, and there’s no raised or lowered areas to reduce the grippy surface making contact with the table. The Pro KO Leverless certainly isn’t going anywhere once you put it on a table, and without the added leverage of an actual stick, it stays put on your lap too.</p>
<p>Underneath the metal case is an exciting builder’s kit of stick parts, and it’s refreshingly easy to customise the Pro KO Leverless when you compare it to other sticks. There’s a set of tongs to pull the buttons, switches, and their surrounds out from the housing, as well as four additional switch internals and the requisite button units.</p>
<p>There’s four circular cover plates, so you can block off up to four of the button spaces, or you can run with anything up to a full complement of 16 inputs. Because of those cover plates and the spare buttons included, you can design your own personal layout and then easily implement it. Don’t like it? Simply try something else. It takes moments to unhook the front cover and a couple of seconds to pull each of the buttons out. It’s satisfying and slick and makes the Pro KO Leverless incredibly easy to live with. There’s no wiring, no soldering, and no worrying with the Pro KO.</p>

<p>The other neat little feature is a locking mechanism for the cable connection. A spring-loaded door opens on the rear of the stick and then cradles the cable once you’ve inserted it. With this setup, you won’t have to worry about it coming loose mid-tournament and suffering the indignation of defeat when Ken simply stops moving.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you’re at home you can add the breakaway attachment so if someone trips over the cable, it won’t rip your £230 fight stick out of your lap. Everywhere you look, the Pro KO Leverless shows signs of intelligent design and thoughtful implementation, and it makes for a great user experience.</p>
<p>At first, interacting with the Pro KO Leverless is more akin to typing on a laptop than using a fight stick. Your left hand utilises the four directional inputs, while your right rests over the eight traditional input buttons. The Cherry MX Speed Silver buttons feel fantastic beneath your fingers, with a good range of travel and you get a reassuringly solid response from each activation.</p>
<p>The top row of buttons gives you access to the traditional Xbox Home, Menu, Options, and Share inputs, while adding in additional access such as muting chat from a headset connected via the 3.5mm socket or altering the RGB lighting. There’s also the tournament-required toggle to lock all of these buttons off, so you don’t pause your opponent to death.</p>

<p>Each of the button surrounds can light up in a variety of hues thanks to the inclusion of RGB. We can all agree that this makes any gaming device better, and here you can choose between a host of colours and different effects directly on the stick, including one of the ugliest setups I’ve ever seen where the buttons are all different colours. I opted for solid purple, because, well, it’s a Victrix stick, and because it looks cool.<br>
If you want to go even deeper, there’s the Victrix Control Hub app, which lets you dig into the lighting even further, as well as update your stick’s firmware and more.</p>
<p>I think I’m a leverless convert. My traditional arcade stick skills have never fully eclipsed my ability with a controller, despite years of trying, and the Pro KO Leverless feels far more intuitive than I could have ever expected. After adjusting to the different way of interacting with my games, I think my reaction times are vastly improved, and aside from that, I haven’t experienced the same level of fatigue from long sessions as I did with a traditional stick.</p>
<p>The Pro KO Leverless won’t be for everybody, and if you’re looking for one of the absolute best fight sticks on the market, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/18/pdp-victrix-pro-fs-best-arcade-fight-stick-ps5-review/">Victrix’s Pro Arcade fight stick</a> is a delight to own. There is also a leverless version if you want the top-end leverless experience, but it’s a further £100, and far bigger and bulkier than the Pro KO. Alternatively, the Razer Kitsune is Razer’s entry in the leverless category, and can be found on sale for around the same price as the Pro KO. However, you lose the button customisation of the Pro KO, which feels essential. You do gain Chroma RGB around the edges though, and you can buy official vinyl skins as well.</p>

            <p>I'm thankfully very remote from the capital these days, but Edwin will occasionally regale the morning meeting with dark fables about how much a pint now costs in London. He'll stumble on to camera, his eyes bloodshot and breathing heavy, and we'll all know he's traded a new vital organ for a swift half. Occasionally he'll dart his head around to the sound of banging at the door then immediately dive out of the window, and we'll pray for his safe return after outrunning The Bad Teapot gang, who he borrowed £8000 from in 2006 for a warm plastic beaker of Carling with a dead wasp floating in it. Sounds bleak down there.</p>
<p>As such, I would not blame anyone south of the Severn-Wash for resorting to the stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle </a>drink stealing antics we find in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sipssassin">Sipssassin</a>. You play a bald, sharply dressed sneak thief. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never pay for another drink as long as you live. There are some nonsense lore reasons about why it's actually good and cool that you're half-inching everyone's tipples but that just makes it less fun, honestly. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Many classic stealth tricks are available to you. Disguising yourself as a security guard. Hiding in a cardboard box. Burying yourself in a ridiculously-placed hay bale. Putting a moose head over your victim's eyes so they can't see you pinch their margarita. As with classic Hitman, there are also a selection of mundane objects to bonk people with, stunning them so you can make a getaway. You're not confined to just Agent 47's disappointing son, either. You'll also unlock other characters, one of which is Agent 47's much less disappointing son, a horrible goose.</p>
<p>There are four game modes in all. 'Sipstraction' tasks you simply with stealing six drinks then scoring you on how many times you were discovered. In 'Happy Hour' you'll need to combo guzzle as many ill-gotten bevvies as possible in a two minute time limit. 'Drinkvesitage' involves a "special tracking activity", and there's also an exploration free roam mode, where you'll take on side quests and meet characters. I'll let good mate <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820190/Sipssassin/">Steam</a> describe the features. That's just good business sense, that.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>25 playable characters to unlock</li>
<li>5 unique missions with hidden secrets</li>
<li>4 distinct game modes to prove your Sipssassin abilities</li>
<li>Over 60 different drinks to drink</li>
<li>Lots of NPCs to steal drinks from</li>
<li>6 Legendary Drinks that grant special power up abilities</li>
<li>6 Special Gadgets that help you be a sneaky little guy</li>
<li>50 collectible shards to find and rebuild the Chalice of Destiny</li>
<li>Disguises to gain access to restricted areas</li>
<li>Wacky characters to meet and talk to</li>
<li>An alternate dimension video game conference called "Yeet3"</li>
<li>A super long straw so you can drink your neighbor's milkshake</li>
<li>Fun</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sipsassin is due out on May 2nd, 2025. No price details, yet. Slightly more than a wasp pint, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>15 years on from the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-2033">Metro 2033</a>, I still think with fondness and yearning of the Uboinik automatic shotgun. It’s a six chamber cylindrical affair with mouthwatering red shells that dangle before your trigger finger like pert, juicy plums. This is just to say / I have shot / the shells / that were in / the shotgun / and which / you were probably / saving / for the mutant round the corner. / Forgive me / they were murderous / so sockety / and so round. Ahem.</p>
<p>Reloading the shotgun is an intricate process of 1) sliding four shells into the available chambers while tossing the weapon jauntily from hand to hand, and then 2) cocking it again to expose and fill the remaining two chambers. You can also chamber a single shell and cock the weapon, if you don’t have time for a full reload, which means when you load another four shells and fire them, there’ll be an empty chamber to reckon with midway through the next burst. That empty chamber has gotten me killed a dozen times, I think.</p><!--more-->

<p>Somebody poured love into that reloading animation. Love and a certain spitefulness. This is Metro 2033, 4A Games’s spiritual successor to S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which takes place in the Moscow underground after the nukes. Ammo is also currency here, and the dingy rails teem with bandits and mutants. There is no time to get poetic about shotguns. Today, 15th April, you can experience all that love and spitefulness for free. The Redux edition is 100% off on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a> till tomorrow to mark the game’s 15th birthday.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-metro-2033">the RPS review of the original Metro 2033</a>, Alec Meer (RPS in peace) was wooed but not wowed, calling attention to “a jarring disconnect between the excellence of its appearance and the adequacy of its action.</p>
<p>"It’s a good enough shooter, but it looks like it should be a phenomenal one,” he went on. “In a perfect world, there’ll be a mod that fiddles with the balance, maybe ups the human count and lowers the mutant count, and definitely leaves a few more gas masks lying around.” </p>
<p>The 2014-released Redux version <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metro-redux-review">adds a bunch of modes and graphics features</a>: as Christopher Livingston summarised, “if you enjoyed Metro 2033, I strongly suspect you'll like it even more on the new engine, especially since the options for a grueling, hardcore experience are still there despite the revamped stealth and improved AI making things a little easier for you.”</p>
<p>The typical question to ask of any 4A Games news piece is: which 4A Games, exactly? The studio began life in Ukraine in 2006, but in 2014, a portion of the team split off to found a new studio in Malta. While they've collaborated on Metro for years, the two studios are now totally separate: 4A Games in Ukraine have rebranded as Reburn, and are now developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/la-quimera">La Quimera</a>, while Metro remains in the hands of the Malta studio, who are still owned by Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A shining beacon of indie ingenuity that proves the only thing you need to achieve global stardom as a lone developer is a singular vision and the willpower to execute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be a colossal misconception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a recent chat with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher Playstack, communications director Wout van Halderen explains that when the company first tweeted about signing the project two years ago the post received a mere smattering of likes. In short: nobody cared.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says the company still jokes internally about the narrative that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> essentially materialized out of thin air when the publisher spent months carefully constructing a "Wheel of Attention" to give the project the&nbsp;best chance of success. What appears like a sudden ascent to fame and fortune was actually the result of a painstakingly intentional marketing campaign that acknowledged the title's weaknesses and played to its strengths.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?">How do you sell a game that shines brightest in the hands of players?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PlayStack marketing director Liz Cheng-Moore recalls how finagling a marketing strategy for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was "tricky" because, although the title seems to click with players when they're able to go hands-on, the UI-heavy visuals and delicious joker-jostling gameplay doesn't lend itself to conventional trailers.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/playstation-platformer-astro-bot-dominates-2025-bafta-game-awards" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation platformer Astro Bot dominates 2025 BAFTA Games Awards</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack initially tried cutting together a trailer focused on gameplay but found it lacking. When that didn't work, a voiceover was added that still didn't quite hit the mark. Next they dialed in on the jokers themselves. Even then, there was something amiss and visuals alone couldn't showcase the buzz of piecing together that perfect run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playstack realized it had to fail fast and pivot. "I think the next best thing to playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is watching someone else playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and seeing the genuine reactions that they're having to the gameplay," says van Halderen. "You see the enthusiasm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The publisher placed streamers in its sights, but rather than blindly pitching to the biggest names in the biz, chose to start small and expand methodically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Van Halderen explains Playstack was "super specific" in its initial approach. He saw overlap with other popular deck-building and "highly-mechanical" titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Slay The Spire</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Auto Pets</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

Add a demo.</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After compiling a finely-tuned outreach list, it was time to start pitching with the knowledge that, at the very least, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would likely pique their interest—and crucially, the interest of their viewers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would have loved it if Markiplier played our game—but I had no evidence that would be the case. He eventually did around a year later, which was amazing, but if you put all of your eggs into that one basket you're not going to get a lot of results," says van Halderen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But if you pitch to 300 smaller streamers you'll get the same kind of numbers and a lot more word of mouth. You get all those communities who are now saying 'oh, my favorite streamer played so I'm going to download it and now I want to chat with out players'—so we're building community at the same time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains that burgeoning community will likely be vocal on social media and other platforms like Discord or Youtube—and may even encourage other steamers they follow to play the game.

I can show you that people are clicking on articles.' I'm very aware that media is not out there to sell my game. I get my coverage, you get your clicks. So we're both happy," continues van Halderen, who notes that data generation is also vital when courting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If people are hungry for more information [...] we can answer questions like 'how long are people playing? How many people are playing?' We would see that thousands of people were spending six to eight hours just on the demo, which is huge. So if I go to press and say 'hey, we got 100,000 downloads on the demo and look how much they played,' then the SEO gears start turning and they will start to think 'maybe there's something here. Maybe we'll do a guide and a few thousand people will click on that.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's at this stage the "Wheel of Attention" comes into focus.

            <p>
A Minecraft Movie has now amassed more than $550m (£415m) globally since its launch less than two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-minecraft-movie-500-million-the-amateur-china-global-international-box-office-1236367389/">Deadline</a> reports that $270m (£204m) of the film's haul comes from overseas, with the UK its biggest market outside of the US, followed by China, Germany, Mexico and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The viral success of the film has caused it to overperform expectations despite limp critical reviews. In short: kids love it, and have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">loved going to throw popcorn in the air during its meme-tastic Chicken Jockey scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Minecraft is proving popular, there's still some way for it to go to beat The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which wound up earning $1.3bn (£982m) during the same spring release window back in 2023, setting the record for the highest-grossing film based on a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Can Minecraft beat Nintendo's mascot? Possibly - it seems like Minecraft still has plenty of life left in it yet, even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the film does now include a warning message asking audiences to behave</a>, in an attempt to curb feral behaviour (and possibly because Warner Bros doesn't want a lawsuit involving animal cruelty after someone brought a live chicken to a showing).
</p>
<p>
Regardless of where A Minecraft Movie ultimately ends up, it's happy days for Warner Bros, which is reportedly already in talks over a potential sequel. And, as is the norm for movies hoping to become franchises these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">A Minecraft Movie naturally ends with a teaser for what could come next</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former developer who worked on the cancelled PlayStation console exclusive Concord has called out online commenters comparing it with Bungie's recently showcased Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie revealed more about its next shooter at the weekend</a> including its release date: 23rd September. Yet the lack of marketing and mixed response to its visual style has sparked comparisons with Concord, and claims that Marathon will be Sony's next flop.</p>
<p>The anonymous developer and artist took to reddit to respond to the comments, asking players to not "punish others for our mistakes".</p>

<p>"It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe. I am not asking for pity, or even sympathy because, after all this is the name of the game, you win or lose. The margin for success is very thin. I took a chance, and lost.</p>
<p>"Some of you probably smell blood in the water, and probably want to roast me for no longer lurking, and exposing myself. I hope you don't, and see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing. Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream, gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon.</p>
<p>"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed."</p>
<p>The developer concluded: "I worked on Concord, and did my best. We came up short, please don't punish others for our mistakes. We are all human beings who are trying to create something special, and Marathon is no different. Be kind, and be cool, as video games are meant to be fun."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-the-pawn-shop-not-working-in-schedule-1-pawn-shop-guy-missing-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pawn Shop’s doors were opened in Schedule 1 in April 2025. It offers a new way to manage your inventory, make money, and cause chaos. This guide runs through everything you need to know, including overcoming the missing pawn guy scenario.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 7 update</a> was a big one for Schedule 1. The developer added a lot more content to the drug-dealing game, such as the Bleuballs Boutique, wall-mounting features, and the Pawn Shop. The latter allows you to sell goods for money and not have to waste goods by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-drops-items-in-schedule-1-discard-items-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping them on the floor</a>.</p>



<p>However, we first need to find the Pawn Shop, work out why the owner is sometimes not there, and how to use it.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">Where is The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the circle. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is directly south of the Motel Room location—and is one building across the road from it.</strong></p>



<p>Again, worst case, you can consult our <strong>map screenshot above</strong> for the precise location of the Pawn Shop. <a href="https://www.scheduleonegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schedule 1</a> doesn’t signpost everything like in other RPGs. But we like this as it’s quite liberating and encourages you to explore. </p>



<p>But if you want the Pawn Shop, follow these instructions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <strong>Motel Room in Northtown</strong> (which you unlock for $75).</li>



<li>Exit the room and walk forward.</li>



<li>Turn right at the<strong> ATM</strong>.</li>



<li>Walk in a straight line past the bus stop.</li>



<li>Cross the road.</li>



<li>You’re at the Pawn Shop!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-pawn-shop-guy-not-there-in-schedule-1">Why is the Pawn Shop Guy Not There in Schedule 1? </h2>



<p><strong>If the Pawn Shop guy isn’t there when you go in, the game has glitched, and you need to save and reload the game to make him appear.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-guy-is-missing">Pawn Shop Guy is Missing</h3>



<p>It’s well-known that the development team for Schedule 1 is very small. Glitches and bugs will get into the system from time to time. The Pawn Shop guy going AWOL is a common occurrence for Schedule 1 players.</p>



<p>If this happens, do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the Pawn Shop, and if it’s open, check if the guy is behind the counter.</li>



<li>If he’s not, you need to save your game.</li>



<li>You do this by <strong>sleeping or using the Intercom device</strong>.</li>



<li>Once it’s done, close down Schedule 1.</li>



<li>Boot it up again.</li>



<li>When you’re back into the action, head to the Pawn Shop again.</li>



<li>Hopefully, the Pawn Shop person should be there.</li>



<li>If he’s not, <strong>rinse and repeat these instructions until it works</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>This bug surely has a fix in development by TVGS. For now, this is a simple workaround.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-pawn-shop-in-schedule-1">How to Unlock The Pawn Shop in Schedule 1</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I see you’re here today. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Pawn Shop is automatically unlocked in Schedule 1, but you need to make sure you arrive between 6 AM and 6 PM.</strong></p>



<p>Pawn Shop guy gives you a generous 12-hour window to visit the establishment. If you arrive out of hours, the shop is closed, leaving you unable to benefit from its services. Come back at the right time to trade in your trinkets.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Four years into a console's life cycle is typically around the time its producer will permanently decrease the console's price. Yesterday, Sony announced it was doing the exact opposite, raising the price of the PlayStation 5 in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and Africa.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/"><span><span><span><span>announcement on the PS Blog</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> does not give a single concrete reason for the price hike, instead citing "a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates." While similar announcements might precede the price change by days or weeks, this increase was put in place nearly immediately and was set in stone today, April 14. While some regions will only see increased prices on the Digital Edition, others, like Australia, have price increases across the board. However, the price of the PS5 Pro will remain unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The blog listed some of the price updates in different parts of the world but left out specifics for the Middle East and Africa, instead pointing people to consult local retailers. Prices for other regions are listed below.</span></span></p>
