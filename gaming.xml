<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s developers have just revealed their future update plans for the game, which include new booster packs by the end of the year, trading for certain cards by January 2025, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers first thanked everyone for playing Pokemon TCG Pocket, which has helped the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit some significant milestones</a>. They then explained the future update plans for the title, where they wish to add various in-game and a lot more content. Check out the new content announced for Pokemon TCG Pocket’s future major update below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game will receive new booster packs “by the end of the year”. Trading for certain cards will begin for Pokemon TCG Pocket in January 2025. The selection of cards that can be traded will be expanded gradually. We will have to wait and see what cards are tradable at launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the developers are working on some other new features, and more details will be revealed when the dates of these updates are finalised. The latest announcement is in line with a Pokemon TCG Pocket leak from days ago. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-reveals-new-packs-an-expansion-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> stated that a new booster pack will potentially arrive on December 16, which is near the “end of the year” window.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Much of the pre-launch discussion around Amazon's upcoming video game anthology show Secret Level has been occupied with fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-will-reportedly-remain-in-amazons-upcoming-secret-level-anthology-series-despite-recent-shutdown">it'll feature Concord</a>, despite the shooter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">abrupt end</a>; but there's plenty more to it than that, and Prime Video has now highlighted some of the other games - many radically reimagined - that'll feature when the show airs on 10th December.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, of course, comes from Tim Miller and other creatives behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots, and looks to take a similar approach to games. In total, it'll span 15 episodes, featuring Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40K, plus a number of PlayStation Studios games.
</p>
<p>
Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">initial Secret Level trailer</a>, released back in August, featured around 90 seconds of blink-and-you'll-miss-it snippets from the series, getting across the vibes the show is aiming for if not much else. However, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvY9Uq7I30Y">latest trailer</a> (seeming the finalised version of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-trailer-for-amazons-secret-level-reveals-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-keanu-reeves">work-in-progress trailer that leaked last month</a>) extends the runtime to a little under three minutes, offering a bit more context and a few more teases of things to come.

<p>
There's plenty of grit in there (probably a little too much, given half the clips are practically indistinguishable), but things get far more interesting when it comes to Secret Level's take on the games with considerably more distinct art styles - namely, the indie and retro titles in its line-up. Sifu, for instance, looks gorgeous, gently evolving the source material's painterly aesthetic, while Spelunky and Mega Man see far more dramatic departures. The latter, for example, has landed somewhere between Pixar and photo-realism in way that's almost certainly going to be divisive. And as for that glimpse of Pac-Man, it's the stuff of nightmares.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in Amazon's trailer, there's confirmation of Secret Level's previously leaked cast list. Keanu Reeves (who did actually pop up in the initial teaser, albeit briefly) will be joined by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Ariana Greenblatt, Temuera Morrison, Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow, Gabriel Luna, Ricky Whittle, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Merle Dandridge, Claudia Doumit, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Clive Standen, Michael Beach, and Laura Bailey.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level creator Miller recently explained (in the same interview he said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">Concord's episode highlighted its world's "potential"</a>) the show will be split into two 'batches', the first covering the grittier stuff, while the latter is more family friendly. We also recently learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">Secret Level's Warhammer instalment is a sequel to Space Marine 2</a>.

		<p>Rebellion has confirmed the release date for its survival action game Atomfall, with that date being March 27th 2025. It has also been confirmed that Atomfall will be available on Xbox Game Pass day one. A brand new trailer to celebrate the release date of Atomfall has been released too, which has a specially composed song for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the North of England in the 1960s, the game’s story branches off from reality following the Windscale fire, the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history at the nuclear plant now known as Sellafield. Following the fallout from the fire, the surrounding area has been put into quarantine, a grand coverup, it seems, for some other mysterious events. The whole quarantine zone has fallen into decay, with crashed helicopters and rusted out cars, while the locals in Windham village are monitored by Protocol – a military group sent in to manage the rescue and help operation. They come with more modern weaponry, and have towering 1950s sci-fi style robots equipped with machine guns and flamethrowers to keep order and patrol both the village and abandoned underground bunkers of BARD – locations key to unpeeling the mystery of the game’s world.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live for both the standard edition of Atomfall and the Deluxe Edition. The Deluxe Edition will include the base game, three days early access, a basic supply bundle, an enhanced supply bundle, and access to the first story expansion which will launch at a later date. No details have yet been released about the content of the story expansion. The standard edition is priced at £44.99 while the Atomfall Deluxe Edition is priced at £64.99. Those who pre-order the standard edition will also get the basic supply bundle.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4.</p>

			<p>Today, Orbital Studios has released a new Half-Life 2 RTX trailer to celebrate the coming twentieth anniversary since Valve launched the masterpiece sci-fi first-person shooter sequel.</p>
<p>As you probably already know if you've read our previous coverage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-is-in-development-by-a-group-of-modders-will-support-ray-tracing-dlss-3-rtx-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX</a>, this is a remastering project that leverages the technologies of NVIDIA's RTX Remix and has the blessing of the original developer, Valve. Orbital Studios, a team of experienced modders, was founded specifically to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p>In this video, Project Lead Wormslayer says:</p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 is my favorite game. It's something I've been playing for over 20 years now. It was unlike any other game I'd played before. the whole game is packed with memorable experiences: stepping off the train for the first time and walking up that platform and seeing Dr Breen appear on the giant screen above you. The gameplay and the storytelling still stand up incredibly well, but we just wanted to recapture that sense of awe that we all had 20 years ago playing it for the first time. </em><em>RTX remix is the core of our remastering process. The original engine has very hard limits.</em></p>
<p><em>In Half-Life 2 RTX, we have fully ray traced reflections and refractions on water and glass and volumetric fog with cool lighting and shadows. We actually have full 3D detail in there, and it's all self-shadowing and reflecting, and it looks pretty stunning.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2 RTX | Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Tribute Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FZ49Ou8zAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the video isn't meant to share any kind of estimate on when we'll actually be able to play the remaster. As the developers point out, there are lots of assets to remaster, and despite the presence of over a hundred contributors, the team is still recruiting.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thunderful-hit-by-yet-more-layoffs-as-studio-refocuses-on-publishing.1035759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio Thunderful has announced another round of layoffs in a further "strategic restructuring program" that's set to affect dozens of employees, mostly focused across the company's development divisions.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/thunderful-doubling-down-on-game-publishing-scaling-back-internal-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on its official website</a>, Thunderful says these layoffs are intended to reflect "a greater focus on third-party game publishing and a reduction in investments in internally-developed projects".</p>

<p>Company CEO Martin Walfisz says announcing Thunderful's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">second "restructuring" wave this year</a> is "unfortunate", but that the company "see[s] no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=nrjCFLcx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=4D4NpPWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Thunderful's name from the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the news post, Thunderful's latest round of layoffs will "result in the termination of a large portion of the development team", although the layoffs won't exclusively be restricted to developers.</p>

<p>Between 80 and 100 employees will be affected by these layoffs. Thunderful says that its subsidiary Coatsink won't be in the firing line, but it seems like the company's other development divisions are all in the crosshairs, so to speak.</p>

<p>News of Thunderful's second layoff wave this year follows on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Stage Clear Studios</a> back in May, at which point Thunderful also reported a 28% drop in revenue on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<p>While Thunderful hasn't released official sales figures for its recent game launches, we do know that city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thunderful-says-steamworld-build-underperformed-reveals-it-s-looking-to-sell-headup" rel="nofollow">fell short of company expectations</a>, and it seems the release of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2&nbsp;</em>earlier this year wasn't enough to recover things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=2l9OONUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=Cs_cjM5e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upcoming Thunderful releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderful's news post doesn't make any suggestion that the company will be canceling upcoming releases, so you can expect recently-announced projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">the roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>to go ahead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderful isn't the only company being subjected to what companies would likely call "challenging market conditions" in recent times.</p>

<p>Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are also being hit by layoffs and studio closures, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a> aren't escaping unscathed either. These are truly difficult times for the gaming industry, it seems, although of course, that's not stopping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">C-suite execs</a> reaping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">rewards galore</a>.</p>

<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapons</h4>



<p>Throughout the pre-season we have seen a steady and healthy variety of weapon usage. Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.</p>



<p>Reminder: We’re using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible. Need an explainer?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes#explainweapondamagetables">Click here!</a></p>



<h5>All Weapons</h5>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering (especially with optics).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hold Breath focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable.</li>



<li>Improved Weapon depth of field settings when performing a Weapon Inspect.</li>
</ul>



<h5>Assault Rifles&nbsp;</h5>



<ul>
<li>We are increasing the damage values for some of our Assault Rifles to ensure that they kill in just one bullet in Hardcore modes. The headshot multiplier changes have either kept the bullets to kill with headshots the same or even improved them at some Min Damage Ranges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h3>



<h4>Maps&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Terminus&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Liberty Falls&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapon Adjustments&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass. We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word “decreased” in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where camos were not being applied to Zombie Builds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to have 3 weapons.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wallbuy rarity would reset when loading into a save.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Elemental Pop&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Elemental Pop would prevent normal Ammo Mod activations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Jugger-nog&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell Augment
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell will now apply damage mitigation when being grabbed by an Amalgam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<h4>Enemies&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where zombies charmed by Brain Rot could prevent the player from completing an exfil.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where loading a save would disable the rampage inducer if it was active.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where zombies would throw guts at the end camera if the player leaves the match to end the game.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Terminus
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where rarely the round would not end after killing all zombies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where the Amalgam could grab the player while slowed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where the Amalgam could pull players into walls causing them to get stuck.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where diving while being hit by knockback from Patient 13 could push the player further than intended.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Liberty Falls
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue that prevented the Abomination from spawning inside Fuller’s Liberty Lanes.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>XP Earn Rates&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where XP was being awarded to all weapons being used in an assist instead of just the last one.
<ul>
<li>If two weapons were used in an assist only the last one used by the players getting the assist will be awarded XP.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Challenges&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wall Buys would not progress the Prestige 8 Challenge Value Town.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Legendary GobbleGums would progress the Ultra Prestige 8 Challenge Full Power instead of Ultra GobbleGums.&nbsp;</li>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-100-hours-complete-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Haert of Chornobyl</a> arrives on November 20, marking the epic and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-gone-gold-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated</a> sequel to Stalker: Call of Pripyat. It’s one of the most exciting releases of 2024, arriving just in time before the end of the year.</p>



<p>The game brings an eerie atmosphere of unsettling survival, where ammo and resources are limited. Many are looking forward to taking on the challenge, but some are wondering if Stalker 2 will be available on PS5.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about whether Stalker 2 will be available on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-stalker-2-be-on-ps5">Will Stalker 2 be on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Stalker 2 will not launch on PlayStation consoles</strong> and there are no details regarding the FPS game coming to PS5 in the future.</p>



<p>Stalker 2 will launch exclusively for Xbox Series X|S and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-pc-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> via Windows. The game will launch on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-stalker-2-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass for PC and the Series X|S</a>. You can also purchase the game via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to GSC Game World.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The previous title, Call of Pripyat, was available on PlayStation 4, so there’s a chance that the game could eventually make its way over to PlayStation. However, there are no details regarding Stalker 2 making its way to Sony’s console just yet. </p>



<p>Many Xbox exclusive titles have eventually made their way to PlayStation such as Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, so perhaps Stalker 2 will follow a similar trajectory and make its way to PS5 somewhere down the line.</p>



<p>If any new information is unearthed about Stalker 2’s availability on PlayStation, we’ll be sure to update this piece with the latest, so stay tuned. How do you feel about Stalker 2 being exclusive to Xbox and PC? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forum</a>.</p>

A comic featured in the 2025 Sonic the Hedgehog Annual claimed the blue blur lived in Green Hill Zone, the iconic opening level to the original Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Sonic lore has otherwise stated he's a drifter, roaming from place to place and never settling down, with even official channels like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&amp;v=CnnqXIGA_UQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TailsTube</a> web series pointing to this fact.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Sonic Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans were therefore relieved to hear Sonic had settled down, while others were in an uproar, forcing the hand of Chris Hernandez, Sega's associate manager of Sonic the Hedgehog lore, who clarified the annual's claim was just a misprint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sorry to burst the bubble so late here," Hernandez said on <a href="https://x.com/MisterCrits/status/1856767895088570382" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-release-date-revealed-for-next-month.1035720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you've been waiting for an open-world game that's packed with cutesy and cozy vibes to get you through the winter, today's your lucky day.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on December 5th, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Sadly, it doesn't look like the game will be getting a Steam release anytime soon, so you'll have to grab it via its own launcher or via the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>According to Infold Games,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has managed to attract 30 million pre-registrations in the runup to its release, so it's clearly striking a chord. Given that this is the fifth installment in the series, perhaps that's to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=gGfjMrhp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=OiBTDOQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>lands next month.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>alumnus Kentaro Tominaga, who served as a game designer on 2017's influential&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, as well as working in a directorial capacity on the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>.</p>

<p>It's not hard to see the influence of more recent&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games on&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, but Infold's game places much more of an emphasis on cozy open-world exploration rather than combat and conflict (although that's definitely in there too).</p>

<p>The studio is promising activities like pet grooming, fishing, and fashion competitions in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, as well as "evocative and engaging story quests" and plenty of platforming challenges to keep you busy as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>below. It also features the game's theme song, "Together Till Infinity", which is performed by pop star Jessie J.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>arrives for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices on December 5th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-sales-fall-by-20-as-company-sells-casual-giant-easybrain-for-1-2b.1035717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group has released its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things aren't looking great for the company, although a massive casual studio sale might help things along a touch.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement summarizing the quarter</a>, Embracer reveals that net sales dropped by 21% on a year-on-year basis, while sales across the first six months of the financial year dipped by 23% (again compared to the same period last year).</p>

<p>More specifically, PC and console sales dropped by 46% for Embracer this quarter and by 40% across the first six months of the fiscal year. Embracer puts this down in part to the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date" rel="nofollow">remaster&nbsp;<em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em></a>, which the company says sold "slower than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=1SUBCpaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=NPXY4TOl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>hasn't done very well for Embracer, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer also says that the releases of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the same period last quarter makes the year-on-year comparison "tough". It's worth noting here too that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly done too well</a> since launch, so it's not really providing a constant revenue stream for Embracer.</p>

<p>Along with its financial results, Embracer has also announced the sale of casual gaming giant Easybrain, the company that owns the Sudoku.com domain.</p>

<p>It's been sold to fellow casual gaming purveyors Miniclip for an eye-watering $1.2 billion, which, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m" rel="nofollow">recent sale of&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium for over $600 million</a>, just demonstrates how strong the mobile and casual markets are.</p>

<p>In general, it's a bit of a gloomy forecast for Embracer; not a single one of the business' divisions has reported increased sales either this quarter or across the April-September period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=JaDa76aP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=FIgHLC_v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Easybrain is now under the Miniclip company umbrella.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Embracer statement, the company also expects its overall yearly earnings to be lower due to "the delay of a number of notable H2 releases".</p>

<p>The company's lineup for the second half of the fiscal year includes&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-trailer-shows-pulse-pounding-action-reveals-release-window" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, with releases like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">Gothic 1 Remake</a>&nbsp;</em>also apparently set to arrive sometime in the next year or so.</p>

<p>We're also currently awaiting the splitting of Embracer into three separate companies, as was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">revealed back in April</a>. Embracer says that Asmodee, in particular, which will handle the company's tabletop properties, is poised to "build on its successful track record" and "[unlock] shareholder value".</p>

<p>BioWare’s reputation as a AAA game development studio is built on three pillars: world-building, storytelling, and character development. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Codex">In-game codices</a> offer textual support for fan theories, replays are kept fresh by systems that encourage experimenting with alternative quest resolutions, and players get so attached to their characters that an entire fan-built ecosystem of player-generated fiction and artwork has sprung up over the years.</p>
<p>After two very publicly disappointing releases with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/early-review-mass-effect-andromeda-is-dragon-age-inquisition-in-space/"><i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/"><i>Anthem</i></a>, BioWare pivoted back to the formula that brought it success, but I’m wrapping up the first third of <i>The Veilguard</i>, and it feels like there’s an ingredient missing from the special sauce. Where are the quests that really let me agonize over the potential repercussions of my choices?</p>
<p>I love <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Thedas">Thedas</a>, and I love the ragtag group of friends my hero has to assemble anew in each game, but what really gets me going as a roleplayer are the morally ambiguous questions that make me squirm: the dreadful and delicious BioWare decisions.</p>
<p>Should I <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Circle">listen to the tormented templar</a> and assume every mage I meet is so dangerous that I need to adopt a "strike first, ask questions later" policy, or can I assume at least some magic users are probably not going to murder me on sight? When I find out <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Demands_of_the_Qun">my best friend’s kleptomania</a> is the reason my city has been under armed occupation for the past 10 years, do I turn her in, or do I swear to defend her to the end?</p>
<p>Questions like these keep me coming back to replay BioWare games over and over. I’ve been eagerly awaiting the release of the fourth game in the Dragon Age franchise so I can find out what fresh dilemmas I’ll have to wrangle, but at about 70 hours in, they seem to be in short supply.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>The allure of interactive media, and the limitations</h2>
<p>Before we get into some actual BioWare choices, I think it’s important to acknowledge the realities of the medium. These games are brilliant interactive stories. They reach me like my favorite novels do, but they offer a flexibility not available in printed media (well, outside of the old Choose Your Own Adventure novels, anyway). I’m not just reading about the main character’s decisions; I’m making the main character’s decisions, and that can be some heady stuff.</p>
<p>There's a limit to how much of the plot can be put into a player's hands, though. A roleplaying game developer wants to give as much player agency as possible, but that has to happen through the illusion of choice. You must arrive at one specific location for the sake of the plot, but the game can accommodate letting you choose from several open pathways to get there. It’s a railroad—hopefully a well-hidden railroad—but at the end of the day, no matter how great the storytelling is, these are still video games. There’s only so much they can do.</p>
<p>So if you have to maintain an illusion of choice but also want to to invite your players to thoughtfully engage with your decision nodes, what do you do? You reward them for playing along and suspending their disbelief by giving their choices meaningful weight inside your shared fantasy world.</p>
<p>If the win condition of a basic quest is a simple “perform action X at location Y,” you have to spice that up with some complexity or the game gets very old very quickly. That complexity can be programmatic, or it can be narrative. With your game development tools, you can give the player more than one route to navigate to location Y through good map design, or you can make action X easier or harder to accomplish by setting preconditions like puzzles to solve or other nodes that need interaction. With the narrative, you’re not limited to what can be accomplished in your game engine. The question becomes, “How much can I give the player to emotionally react to?”</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>In a field packed with quality roleplaying game developers, this is where BioWare has historically shined: making me have big feelings about my companions and the world they live in. This is what I crave.</p>

<h2>Who is (my) Rook, anyway?</h2>
<p><i>The Veilguard</i> sets up your protagonist, Rook, with a lightly sketched backstory tied to your chosen <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Factions_(The_Veilguard)">faction</a>. You pick a first name, you are assigned a last name, and you read a brief summary of an important event in Rook’s recent history. The rest is on you, and you reveal Rook’s essential nature through the dialog wheel and the major plot choices you make. Those plot choices are necessarily mechanically limited in scope and in rewards/consequences, but narratively, there’s a lot of ground you can cover.</p>

<p>During the game’s tutorial, you’re given information about a town that has mysteriously fallen out of communication with the group you’re assisting. You and your companions set out to discover what happened. You investigate the town, find the person responsible, and decide what happens to him next. Mechanically, it’s pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>The real action is happening inside your head. As Rook, I’ve just walked through a real horror show in this small village, put together some really disturbing clues about what’s happening, and I'm now staring down the person responsible while he’s trapped inside an uncomfortably slimy-looking cyst of material the game calls <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Blight">the Blight</a>. Here is the choice: What does my Rook decide to do with him, and what does that choice say about her character? I can’t answer that question without looking through the lens of my personal morality, even if I intend for Rook to act counter to my own nature.</p>
<p>My first emotional, knee-jerk reaction is to say screw this guy. Leave him to the consequences of his own making. He’s given me an offensively venal justification for how he got here, so let him sit there and stare at his material reward for all the good it will do him while he’s being swallowed by the Blight.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The alternative is saving him. You get to give him a scathing lecture, but he goes free, and it’s because you made that choice. You walked through the center of what used to be a vibrant settlement and saw this guy, you know he’s the one who allowed this mess to happen, and you stayed true to your moral center anyway. Don’t you feel good? Look at you, big hero! All those other people will die from the Blight, but you held the line and said, “Well, not this one.”</p>

      Being vindictive might feel good, but I feel leaving him is a profoundly evil choice.

<p>There’s no objectively right answer about what to do with the mayor, and I’m here for it. Leaving him or saving him: Neither option is without ethical hazards. I can use this medium to dig deep into who I am and how I see myself before building up my idea of who my Rook is going to be.</p>
<p>Make your decision, and Rook lives with the consequences. Some are significant, and some… not so much.</p>

<h2>Your choices are world-changing—but also can’t be</h2>
<p>Longtime BioWare fans have historically been given the luxury of having their choices—large and small—acknowledged by the next game in the franchise. In past games, this happened largely through small dialog mentions or NPC reappearances, but as satisfying as this is for me as a player, it creates a big problem for BioWare.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: depending on the actions of the player, ginger-haired bard and possible romantic <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Leliana">companion Leliana</a> can be missed entirely as a recruitable companion in <i>Dragon Age: Origins</i>, the first game in the franchise. If she is recruited, she can potentially die in a <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Urn_of_Sacred_Ashes">later quest</a>. It’s not guaranteed that she survives the first game. That’s a bit of a problem in <i>Dragon Age II</i>, where Leliana shows up in one of the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Exiled_Prince">downloadable content packs</a>. It’s a bigger problem in the third game, where Leliana is the official spymaster for the titular Inquisition. BioWare calls these NPCs who can exist in a superposition of states "quantum characters."</p>

      </figure>

<p>If you follow this thought to its logical end, you can understand where BioWare is coming from: After a critical mass of quantum characters is reached, the effects are impossible to manage. BioWare sidesteps the Leliana problem entirely in <i>The Veilguard</i>&nbsp;by just not talking about her.</p>
<p>BioWare has staunchly maintained that, as a studio, it does not have a set canon for the history of its games; there’s only the personal canon each player develops as a result of their gameplay. As I’ve been playing, I can tell there’s been a lot of thought put into ensuring none of <i>The Veilguard</i>’s in-game references to areas covered in the previous three games would invalidate a player’s personal canon, and I appreciate that. That’s not an easy needle to thread. I can also see that the same care was put into ensuring that this game’s decisions would not create future quantum characters, and that means the choices we're given are very carefully constrained to this story and only this story.</p>
<p>But it still feels like we’re missing an opportunity to make these moral decisions on a smaller scale. <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i> introduced a collectible and cleverly hidden item for players to track down while they worked on saving the world. Collect enough trinkets and you eventually open up an entirely optional area to explore. Because this is BioWare, though, there was a catch: To find the trinkets, you had to stare through the <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Ocularum">crystal eyes of a skull</a> sourced from the body of a mage who has been forcibly cut off from the source of all magic in the world. Is your Inquisitor on board with that, even if it comes with a payoff? Personally, I don’t like the idea. My Inquisitor? She thoroughly looted <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Solasan">the joint</a>. It’s a small choice, and it doesn’t really impact the long-term state of the world, but I still really enjoyed working through it.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Later in the first act of <i>The Veilguard</i>, Rook finally gets an opportunity to make one of the big, ethically difficult decisions. I’ll avoid spoilers, but I don’t mind sharing that it was a satisfyingly difficult choice to make, and I wasn’t sure I felt good about my decision. I spent a lot of time staring at the screen before clicking on my answer. Yeah, that’s the good stuff right there.</p>
<p>In keeping with the studio’s effort to avoid creating quantum worldstates, <i>The Veilguard</i> treads lightly with the mechanical consequences of this specific choice and the player is asked to take up the narrative repercussions. How hard the consequences hit, or if they miss, comes down to your individual approach to roleplaying games. Are you a player who inhabits the character and lives in the world? Or is it more like you’re riding along, only watching a story unfold? Your answer will greatly influence how connected you feel to the choices BioWare asks you to make.</p>

<h2>Is this better or worse?</h2>
<p>Much online discussion around <i>The Veilguard</i> has centered on Bioware’s decision to incorporate only three choices from the previous game in the series, <i>Inquisition</i>, rather than using the existing <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/">Dragon Age Keep</a> to import an entire worldstate. I’m a little disappointed by this, but I’m also not sure anything in Thedas is significantly changed because my Hero of Ferelden was a softie who convinced the guard in the Ostagar camp to give his lunch to <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hungry_Deserter">the prisoner</a> who was in the cage for attempted desertion.</p>
<p>At the same time, as I wrap up the first act, I’m missing the mild tension I should be feeling when the dialog wheel comes up, and not just because many of the dialog choices seem to be three flavors of “yes, and…” One of my companions was deeply unhappy with me for a period of time after I made the big first-act decision and sharply rebuffed my attempts at justification, snapping at me that I should go. Previous games allowed companions to leave your party forever if they disagreed enough with your main character; this doesn’t seem to be a mechanic you need to worry about in <i>The Veilguard</i>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Rook’s friends might be divided on how they view her choice of verbal persuasion versus percussive diplomacy, but none of them had anything to say about it while she was very earnestly attempting to convince a significant NPC they were making a pretty big mistake. One of Rook’s companions later asked about her intentions during that interaction but otherwise had no reaction.</p>

<p>Seventy hours into the game, I’m looking for places where I have to navigate my own ethical landscape before I can choose to have Rook conform to, or flaunt, the social mores of northern Thedas. I’m still helping people, being the hero, and having a lot of fun doing so, but the problems I’m solving aren’t sticky, and they lack the nuance I enjoyed in previous games. I want to really wrestle with the potential consequences before I decide to do something. Maybe this is something I’ll see more of in the second act.</p>
<p>If the banal, puppy-kicking kind of evil has been minimized in favor of larger stakes—something I applaud—it has left a sort of vacuum on the roleplaying spectrum. BioWare has big opinions about how heroes should act and how they should handle interpersonal conflict. I wish I felt more like I was having that struggle rather than being told that’s how Rook is feeling.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful my Rook isn’t just going to just save the world, but that in the next act of the game, I'll see more opportunities from BioWare to let her do it her way.</p>

Free Range Games’ survival and crafting game first launched on PC as an Epic Games Store exclusive in October last year, before coming out on PS5 in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re on The Lord of the Rings, Embracer said Middle-earth Enterprises had a “slow quarter” year-on-year (the July to September Q2), with no notable new partner releases, but a higher film revenue than expected. Embracer said it’s seen encouraging fan reactions to the marketing it’s doing for the December release of anime <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim">The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer had a brutal Q2 for PC and console games, with tough comparisons from last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/remnant-ii">Remnant 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>. The most notable new release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, late in the quarter, “was well received by players but initial digital sales were slower than expected.” That’s corporate speak for a flop. In contrast, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review">Satisfactory’s 1.0 launch on PC</a> “performed above management expectations,” which means it did great. Coffee Stain Studios’ first-person open-world factory building game had over 200,000 concurrent players in September.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embracer has endured a tough time in recent years, laying off thousands of staff (the number of game developers working at the firm has decreased from 10,654 to 6,250) and selling a number of its studios, including Borderlands maker Gearbox and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive. Today, it announced the sale of subsidiary puzzle game mobile developer Easybrain to digital games company Miniclip for $1.2 billion, which should keep the lights on for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the rest of its financial year, Embracer is pinning its hopes on the hotly anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which it said was still on track for its February 11, 2025 release date. It still owns Metro developer 4A Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game">which is working on a brand new game in the series</a>. Asmodee, Embracer's tabletop games company, is still up for sale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the past 15 months, we have created a stronger foundation for long-term value creation, lowering our net debt and our capex," Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have many high-performing and efficient companies, several with industry leading margins. However, we acknowledge that parts of our PC/Console and Entertainment &amp; Services segments are still underperforming due to delays and low ROI for primarily small and mid-sized releases. Combined with fixed operating costs this creates unacceptable margins which we are firmly addressing ahead of the spin-offs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other Embracer games in the works include Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Fellowship, Gothic 1 Remake, Hyper Light Breaker, Killing Floor 3, REANIMAL, Satisfactory (console), Titan Quest II, Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered, and Wreckfest 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s a fair few VR platforming mascots that have come and gone, the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/03/super-luckys-tale-review/">Lucky</a> graduating to broader flatscreen adventure, leaving a gap for new heroes to fill. Enter the quite adorable, yet inexplicably named Max Mustard. Can he make the cut?</p>
<p><iframe title="Max Mustard Official Trailer | PlayStation VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q_mfBhTzdAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with a large, tentacle-y alien robot kidnapping a bunch of adorable critters, called Mudpups. Just as it’s about to get its tentacles on you, Max Mustard turns up and scares it off, so you immediately team up with Mustard to fight off the alien’s various minions and save the Mudpups. By controlling Max with your robot-VR-controller hands. It’s a platformer, it doesn’t need to make perfect sense.</p>


<p>The platforming in Max Mustard is similar to that of his VR platforming predecessors. It’s essentially a classic platformer but rendered in a world that’s wrapped around you in 3D, so you can physically move your head to look around and follow the character through the world. There’s also more player interaction with the levels, whether it’s shooting guns with your actual hands, peeking around corners for hidden collectibles, that kind of thing.</p>


<p>You’ll accompany Max through four arcs, each of which has its own overworld map to work your way through, freeing Mudpups and collecting coins as you go. The platforming here is good, but not particularly notable. It does everything competently, but it doesn’t do anything particularly special. However, being a VR game does help make it more notable.</p>
<p>In addition to some of those coins and critters being hidden behind corners or other places that are easy to miss if you’re not careful, there’s also things like the plunger gun that you get very early on that turns a level into a platformer/shooting range at the same time, or the vacuum gun that allows you to suck enemies up and launch them at others.</p>
<p>There’s some nice touches without these specific tools as well, such as one area where two coins were definitely out of reach of Max, but I was pleasantly surprised when my random thought to just reach out and pick them up with my actual hand worked!&nbsp;The game also isn’t afraid to throw you off ledges mid-level either, or if you are foolish enough to pull the “Do not pull” cord in the van between levels, it shoots you through the roof for a bit before you fall all the way back down and land back where you started. Things like this just make me smile similarly to when it first handed me a plunger gun. It’s just fun!</p>

<p>It’s this combinations of VR and platforming where the game really shines, but there are a few great ideas sprinkled through the levels that don’t rely on it as well. One level was made of alternating platforms that changed every time I jumped, and another did something similar in time to the music – music that could be customised part way through the level with buttons to turn instruments on and off and it stayed that way for the remainder of the level. There’s also a few mini levels, such as shooting ranges for the plunger gun with some pretty tight time requirements to gain a Gold medal and a Mudpup as a prize, or the coin frenzy where you just jump Max through a stream of coins to try and collect as many as possible in a certain time. This latter one is particularly useful when it comes to buying upgrades, which you can do at an in-game shop and has a selection of upgrades for both Max and yourself. The first one was unlocking snap to turn, so you can turn your view with the controller instead of physically turning in real life – honestly quite ridiculous to have an accessibility or VR comfort feature locked behind a game upgrade – but then there’s also the spin attack for Max, faster move speed, an in-the-air dash attack, and so on.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty great, too. On PSVR2 it is crystal clear without a frame drop in sight, not even when you’re flying through the roof of your van suddenly. There’s plenty of details in the world and especially on Max, whose ponytail flutters about in their wake. The game’s aesthetic is pretty much what you expect for a platformer – it’s all bright a cutesy, even the enemies, and it doesn’t need to do anything more than that really. Most importantly, If you walk Max close to you they’ll look right at you and I challenge you not to say “aww” the first time it happens.</p>

<p>Throughout all this, Max handles almost exactly like Astro Bot, right down to jet boots which let Max float a bit in the air rather than double jump, except Max’s boots shoot flames rather than lasers. It’s clear that Astro Bot was a big influence here, but there’s more as well – there’s critters to rescue ala Sonic, you save them by breaking the under-sized cages they’re trapped in like Rayman, there’s bouncy crates with arrows pointing upwards similar to Crash Bandicoot, you choose what level to play via a overworld map with set routes like Mario, Basically, there’s a love for platformers and you see the breadcrumbs of that appreciation spread throughout the game.</p>
<p>This feeds into the only real problem with the game: it’s just kind of unremarkable. It plays well, it’s competently designed, it looks good, and gathers various ideas from other places and blends them into a game that is good and enjoyable enough, but it isn’t going to blow your mind either.</p>
<p>The only other negative really worth mentioning is that, when moving your head and moving Max at once, you tend to end up walking off in the wrong direction because it can be fiddly to judge the direction, as it changes based on your view. This is easy to adjust your playing style for, and only cost me three deaths.</p>
