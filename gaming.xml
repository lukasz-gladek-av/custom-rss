By leveraging AI, we create more&nbsp;engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning. Embracer Group also understands the potential risks associated with the use of AI.</p><p>Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>Developers have expressed concerns about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24042070/gdc-state-of-the-video-game-industry-survey-2023-ai">the use of AI in making games</a> and how AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23700619/ai-game-development-jobs-gdc-2023">might affect their jobs</a>. Those concerns might be particularly high regarding any AI initiatives from Embracer given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">the company’s recent layoffs</a>. But Tomas Hedman, Embracer’s head of privacy and AI governance, says the company doesn’t want to use AI in place of humans.</p><p>“We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” according to a statement from Hedman in the report. “This is the core of our human-centric&nbsp;approach to leveraging the potential with AI.” Hedman also argues that AI can “open up coding to a broader group of developers” by lowering the barrier to making games.</p><p>That said, Embracer believes it needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. In a heat map, Embracer identifies “non implementation of AI” as a potential “major” risk. “Not using AI for relevant tasks within Embracer Group will lead to us losing competitiveness and being outrun by our competitors,” the company says. Embracer also tracks AI governance as a potential risk, noting that the use of AI is “subject to general as well as specific laws and requirements.”</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181027/netflix-house-retail-dallas-king-of-prussia-2025"><h2>Netflix House will fill the voids left by dead department stores</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181870/openai-former-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-ssi-safe-superintelligence"><h2>OpenAI’s former chief scientist is starting a new AI company</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><h2>Zelda is finally getting her own game</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180340/apple-pay-later-shutting-down-months-after-launch"><h2>Apple is shutting down Apple Pay Later just months after launch</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181214/eu-chat-control-law-propose-scanning-encrypted-messages-csam"><h2>EU chat control law proposes scanning your messages — even encrypted ones</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182599/elden-ring-patch-elden-beast-torrent<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wwqFyu">A new patch for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> was released Thursday, ostensibly to prepare the game for the arrival of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> DLC on June 21. But players of the base game are also getting a lovely treat, in the form of a major quality-of-life update to the base game’s final boss battle.</p>
<p id="yj9DIl">According to Bandai Namco’s <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">patch notes for version 1.12 of <em>Elden Ring</em></a>, developer FromSoftware has added a “new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.” <em>Elden Ring</em> players who have faced the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24173795/elden-beast-boss-fight-how-to-beat">Elden Beast</a> will know what a relief it is to have Torrent available in this situation, as the final boss battle involves a torturous amount of running from one side of the battle arena to the other, back and forth, and back and forth again, while chasing the always-moving monster.</p>
<p id="3oF2s1">While the Elden Beast battle was a majestic and challenging final confrontation, the incessant running around players had to do to get in a few swipes of a sword or get within spellcasting range was something of a nightmare. Especially since the Elden Beast is a two-parter; one needs to defeat another boss, Radagon, before facing the beast, and failure in the second part meant repeating the first.</p>

<p id="RK3Ku9">But the ability to summon Torrent in the Elden Beast boss fight isn’t the only major quality-of-life update for <em>Elden Ring</em> in patch 1.12. FromSoft has added a new “Recent Items” tab to players’ inventory screen, letting them easily find the latest thing (weapon, cookbook, talisman, etc.) they’ve picked up. Newly obtained items are marked with a “!” symbol, which will be hugely important for players acquiring a ton of new stuff with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. (Note that the Recent Items tab is an opt-in feature in the game’s settings menu, and having used it for the past week, I highly recommend turning it on!)</p>
<p id="s5CnLC"><em>Elden Ring</em> patch 1.12 does a whole lot more. There are new hairstyles, new PvP-exclusive balance adjustments, and a long list of weapon and skill tweaks, all of which are worth reviewing before diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> for the first time. </p>

That’s the <strong>Superi 46</strong>. It’s lightweight, easy to wield, and boasts a high rate of fire and low time to kill, making it ideal for the tight confines of Urzikstan or Rebirth Island.</p><p>Here are some key Superi 46 stats you might want to keep in mind for your next round:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Time to Kill</strong>: 616 ms</li><li><strong>ADS Speed</strong>: 204 ms</li><li><strong>Mobility</strong>: 5.0/s</li><li><strong>Max Range</strong>: 14.0m</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-recommend-id="image://eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-recommend-id="image://eff44b5a3f1801dde5c888be5c06ea95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pointing the Superi 46 at a naughty building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h17400"><a id=""></a>Which perks and attachments to use for <em>Warzone</em>’s Superi 46</h2><p>If at all possible, while using the Superi 46, run the following perks:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Fast Hands</strong>: Reload, use equipment, and swap weapons faster.</li><li><strong>High Alert</strong>: Directional vision pulses when an enemy outside your view aims at you.</li><li><strong>Double Time</strong>: Doubles your Tactical Sprint duration and increases crouch movement speed by 30%.</li></ul><p>These perks emphasize the fast-paced gameplay necessary to excel with the Superi 46. Like any other submachine gun, even those outside the meta, the key to winning a fight with one is to fire fast and fire first. If you can surprise your opponent, they won’t have a chance to react appropriately, leaving you the opportunity to unload an entire magazine in their rears.<br></p><p>Lastly, you won’t always have the option of your preferred weapon attachments, but if you can score a loadout drop and you have a Superi 46 in your kit, here’s what you should run:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Zulu OP3 Light Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Zehmn35 Compensated Flash Hider</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Phantom Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Rescue-9 Stock</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: 40 Round Mag</li></ul><p>Whether you’re running the Superi 46 as a primary or secondary weapon, it excels in close-range encounters. It’s typically best to carry a long-range accompaniment, such as an assault or bolt-action sniper rifle, to hit targets from afar before moving in to finish the job.<br></p><h2 id="h17401"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions in the SMG Category</h2><figure id="" data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The SMGs in <em>Warzone</em> are highly effective, so most prove useful.

It’s not the top choice for competitive or diehard <em>Warzone</em> players, but the Swarm feels underrated. It’s swift, boasts a large magazine, and has one of the fastest rates of fire in the battle royale. You can make quick work of a small squad, should you land your shots.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>I didn't see much of Outlaws' story at Summer Game Fest, but what I saw of the gameplay did not leave a positive impression.</p></section>

                <p>I'm more shocked than anyone that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't resonate with me. I love Star Wars, and have been hoping to get a new game in which we don't play as yet another Force-sensitive person. But after playing through three different sections of Outlaws at Summer Game Fest--each of which was about 15-20 minutes long--I walked away disappointed. Nothing about Outlaws feels bad; hell, bad would have been better than what I played, because then at least it could have been memorable in some way. Instead, Outlaws feels fairly mediocre and unmemorable. What I played feels like an amalgamation of different features and mechanics borrowed from other games that do those things better, all while masquerading as a Star Wars game without actually embodying the themes and storylines of Star Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Outlaws sees you play as Kay Vess, a smuggler striving to be a famed scoundrel by accomplishing heists throughout the Outer Rim. Though I didn't get to see these elements, Outlaws will feature instances where Kay can talk her way out of trouble and the game will feature a system akin to Grand Theft Auto's Wanted levels, in which Kay's actions have consequences that can chase her across the open worlds she'll be able to explore.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Outlaws Feels Like Respawn’s Jedi Games | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At SGF, I played in three contained, linear levels. The first saw Kay working her way through an Imperial facility before leaping into her ship and engaging in a dogfight against some TIE Fighters. The second part focused on the game's platforming mechanics, with Kay navigating a derelict ship. The third and final portion of the preview presented a level in which Kay was tasked with stealthily infiltrating an organization's base to steal back some stolen tech.</p><p dir="ltr">I have individual complaints with each of the sections but my main gripe with Star Wars Outlaws, based on this slice of the game, is that Kay feels way too powerful. It's possible Ubisoft put me on the easiest difficulty for the preview to make sure I'd get through each one in a timely manner, but if that's not the case then Outlaws is laughably easy. The ease of the third part of the preview feels the most damning. I wanted to see what would happen if I broke stealth, inciting the dozen nearby enemies in the immediate area to attack me all at once. I easily killed them all and subsequently completed the first part of my mission without having to sneak around. With this newfound confidence, I ran through the second half of the level, forgoing stealth entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">I eventually reached a locked door that I couldn't go through until all the enemies who had seen me were dead. I was far enough away that I couldn't quite see the enemies all the way back at the start of the area but my cursor occasionally changed from gray to red whenever the game registered that Kay was "aiming" at them, even if I could no longer see them. I just held the trigger whenever that happened and sniped the guards without even having to aim myself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kay's apparent invulnerability and god-like powers persisted throughout the demo, whether it was surviving three-story drops in the platforming sections or getting into a firefight and tanking multiple hits. Aside from simply feeling dull to play, this actively gets in the way of Kay's characterization as a scrappy scoundrel and smuggler. If anything, playing as Kay should feel more like how Han Solo accomplished problems in the original Star Wars trilogy--you take your shot when you can but you're far better off running away when the blaster bolts start flying. Even if Kay has no apparent Force powers (it's entirely possible we discover she does in the full game), Outlaws seems to be designed in a way to encourage you to play like she actually does--she can easily perform huge acrobatic leaps, make pinpoint shots without a sniper rifle, and take on hordes of enemies like they're nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Kay's strength also detracts from one of the core pillars of Outlaws, which is Kay's adorable partner-in-crime Nix. Nix can be commanded to aid Kay in a number of ways, such as distracting guards, fetching an out-of-reach weapon, or exploding a grenade in a person's pocket. Causing someone who's just minding their own business to suddenly explode is hilarious, but I never felt like I needed to use that command, or any of the others, in order to accomplish my goals. Kay is so versatile and able on her own, I never actually used Nix save for a few moments when the Ubisoft rep beside me told me how I could use Nix to solve the problem at hand and I did so to see how it would play out. I left the preview wondering why Nix is even a part of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384" data-ratio="0.56206896551724" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My misgivings about Outlaws' lack of challenge aside, what I saw of the minute-to-minute gameplay also isn't all that remarkable. Kay handles a blaster just about as well as any other third-person shooter protagonist, and much like her peers in the action genre, she is regularly stymied by locked doors that can only be bypassed with annoying lockpicking minigames or finding an energy pylon to energize with an electrified shot. Again, none of what I played feels outright bad but it is very familiar and none of it stands out as notably good as a result--it doesn't help that a lot of what Outlaws does, Star Wars games that have come out in recent years have done much better. The shooting is fine but pales in comparison to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-463558">Battlefront II</a>, for example. The ship combat is unremarkable, especially on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-squadrons/" data-ref-id="5000-513910">Squadrons</a>. And the platforming challenges and puzzles feel like unimaginative speed bumps that don't take into account the same level of spectacle or narrative importance as those in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/" data-ref-id="5000-483335">Fallen Order</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-565322">Survivor</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I also didn't get a strong impression of Kay or any of the characters she met during the three sections I played. Perhaps Ubisoft is going for more of a blank slate for Kay to make her easier to connect to for more people, but even so, Star Wars lives and dies by its characters and it's difficult to feel excited for Outlaws when I played the game for nearly an hour and didn't really relate to anyone. It's an odd miss for Ubisoft, which usually develops games that are hit-or-miss for a lot of people but--at least for the story-driven ones--tend to have a handful of fairly memorable characters. Granted, Outlaws still could. But the sections I played through don't suggest that to be the case.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1744940974" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

reminded me of previewing 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row/" data-ref-id="5000-536956">Saints Row</a>, a game that paints over half-baked systems and average storytelling with the trappings of a franchise I love. Outlaws so far feels exactly the same, using the imagery and sounds of Star Wars to disguise an otherwise mediocre game. Maybe the full release of Outlaws will surprise me in a way the full release of Saints Row didn't, but I have serious misgivings about Outlaws that I didn't have prior to playing it. The full game could be fantastic, but if so, this preview didn't sell me on it.</p><p dir="ltr">As one final addendum, what I played at Summer Game Fest did not look <em>anything</em> at all like what was shown off during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6523848/" data-ref-id="1100-6523848">Ubisoft Forward</a>--that gameplay seems way more exciting and appropriate for a Star Wars game about a smuggler struggling to survive during the height of the Galactic Empire. That gameplay showcase dives into how Kay can use her scrappiness to learn new skills that will aid her in a pinch while still highlighting her shortcomings as an easily overwhelmed flesh-and-blood human who is better off fleeing from a dangerous situation than sticking around. If Outlaws plays more like what we saw at Ubisoft Forward and less like what I actually got to play at SGF, I think it will prove to be an entertaining Star Wars game. Only time will tell which experience we're going to get, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on August 30.</p>

<p data-characters="147" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Madden 25’s</em> new BOOM Tech system introduces physics-based tackling, improved ball carrier mechanics, and new catching and pre-play features. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">In the first <em>Madden 25</em> <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/gridiron-notes-welcome-to-madden-25">blog</a>, EA provided a deep dive into BOOM Tech, which has been two years in the making. To start, BOOM Tech offers realistic control with every tackle, meaning players can punish ball carriers with devastating hit sticks or fly past offensive linemen with new truck, dive, and stiff arm animations. In addition, the new data-driven physics take into account timing, weight, speed, strength, and player ratings in one-on-one ball plays. The new hit stick makes it possible to tackle ball carriers harder than ever before based on the angle of impact, stick-skill, and accuracy of the cut sticks, big hits, and trucks. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">Players will feel the tackles as if they were on the field themselves thanks to the new sound effects and controller rumble hactics when a crunching tackle connects just right. Offense also gets an overhaul thanks to Boom Tech. A new ball carrier balance and recovery system makes it easier for running backs to counter the hit stick, break a tackle, and recover their balance before going down. </p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">As for when players can try out the new BOOM Tech system for the first time, <em>Madden 25</em> launches on August 16. </p>

 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Since the beginning albums are easy to complete, only requiring one and two-star stickers, they don’t provide much dice. However, the further you go, the more challenging the sets are to finish. Completing this rewards you with more dice, though, so it’s worth focusing on these when trading for new stickers or participating in events.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-stickers-in-nbsp-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">How to get stickers in&nbsp;Monopoly GO</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Getting new cards in <em>Monopoly GO</em> requires opening sticker packs, which you can get using numerous methods. You’ll open sticker packs to gain new cards, and their rarities determine the card types you get. A one-star pack will usually give you one and two-star stickers, with five-stars being guaranteed to provide you with one five-star card, among others of random qualities.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Below are some ways you can get sticker packs in <em>Monopoly GO:</em></p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false"> <li>Participate in banner events and tournaments</li> <li>Complete reward tiers in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-monopoly-go-partner-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partners events</a>, Peg-E’s prize drop minigame, and Treasure hunt events</li> <li>Finish your daily Quick Win objectives</li> <li>Redeem a free shop gift every eight hours</li> <li>Trade with other players</li> <li>Complete showroom tiers</li> <li>Redeem <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-join-the-tycoon-club-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tycoon Club rewards</a></li> <li>Purchase sticker packs using real-world money</li> </ul> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="944" data-injectable="false">By far the easiest ways to get sticker packs are completing reward tiers in ongoing events and tournaments. While beginning reward milestones give you low-rarity sticker packs, finishing every tier usually gives you several four and five-star packs, depending on the event. Completing your daily quick win objectives also gives you a one-star sticker pack each day, with your weekly prizes giving you extra packs. Alongside these, you can also trade with other players to get stickers, redeem Tycoon Club rewards, or even use real money to buy packs if you wish. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/2024/6/20/24182415/elden-ring-cloth-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RRLtng">When you boot up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> for the first time, make sure you appreciate <em>Elden Ring’s</em> unsung hero: cloth.</p>
<p id="qfRRgP">FromSoftware has long been the master of dynamic cloth physics. That is, cloth that doesn’t follow a pre-set animation, but instead moves procedurally, based on an in-game physics engine.</p>
<p id="qnbM1D">It sounds simple, but it’s genuinely <em>really hard to do.</em></p>
<p id="sKjsgy">But FromSoftware has been doing it for years, and <em>Elden Ring</em> is just the latest and greatest manifestation of the studio’s cloth obsession. <em>Elden Ring</em>’s cloth isn’t just technically impressive, though. It communicates vital information about the world, and the characters that populate it.</p>
<p id="XvlPGi"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Take Mohg</a>, for example.</p>
<p id="91TlR1">He’s a messy boy who loves drama — and he’s dressed for it. The cape that he’s flung over his shoulders is a sumptuous red velvet, with a gold tassel fringe. </p>
<p id="PNhg35">“It’s very, quite literally in my opinion, theatrical,” visual artist Faith Schaffer pointed out in an interview. “It’s your classic red curtain with gold fringe.”</p>
<p id="FLIqAO">Mohg is the shunned child of the royal lineage, but instead of accepting a life in the sewers, he’s convinced himself he’s going to create his own dynasty. That plan somehow involves dressing like an absolute pimp and kidnapping his stepbrother. But really, he has one of the most baroque outfits in the game, which reads as extreme compensation for the royal treatment he was denied. He is putting on a show.</p>
<p id="PEEz6y">And FromSoftware always goes the extra mile when it creates dynamic cloth. The Godskin Duo are, yeah, wearing flesh. It looks disgusting, clammy, and blobby. It would be gross under any circumstances. But this flesh-cloth has its own physics parameters that cause it to flop and wobble. </p>
<p id="DN21kS">It’s a great example of how good FromSoftware is at using uniquely tuned physics to create distinct <em>movement</em>. If they had copied and pasted the same physics parameters they used for a velvet shawl or cotton cloak, it would still be distressing. But they went the extra mile and tuned the dangly bits of the robe to move with a distinct, cartilaginous wobble. </p>
<p id="WjpjJF">To learn more about how FromSoftware’s cloth contributes to the incredible worldbuilding of Elden Ring, <a href="https://youtu.be/wSSqx-Dh6ko">check out the video above</a>!

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While exploring the Tiderise Cliff area in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>, the Rover can get an extra amount of 20 Astrite by taking part in the Kitten’s Luck Lucky Draw. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">But although the system behind the draw is simple —you pay the 5x fish fee, pick a chest, and then open it for a chance of getting the prize— finding the latter can prove to be a little tricky. So that you can find it on your first try, here’s in which chest the Ultimate Prize is located on <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-ultimate-prize-chest-location-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Ultimate Prize Chest location in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">You can find the Ultimate Prize in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> by opening the Basic Supply Chest located by the stairs leading to the Lucky Draw area. The chest will be located by a wooden lamplight and be placed almost parallel to a Standard Supply Chest.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Upon opening the chest, the Treasure Store’s Hostess will show her surprise and close off her shop. Apart from the already mentioned 20 Astrite, you will also receive the following as part of the Ultimate Prize:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Three Wood Textured Shards</li> <li>6.000 Shell Credits</li> <li>30 Union EXP</li> <li>One to three Basic Energy Cores</li> <li>A random number of Basic, Medium, and Advanced Sealed Tubes </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-how-to-get-fish-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get fish in Wuthering Waves</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">The main way to get fish in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> can be done by catching them. You can do that by heading to any body of water and then either swimming or walking to them before pressing the gathering key/button. Although the fish in the game are pretty passive and will usually only move after you reach them, you can attack them beforehand to make the process easier. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">I was able to find a large quantity of fish in the waters surrounding the Kitten’s Luck. You can also find a consistent amount of it on the shallow pool housing the Bell-Borne Geochelone boss. Interestingly enough, Tetra is the only type of fish currently available in <em>WuWa</em>. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">If you are not in the mood to do the above, you can buy Fish from Mahe’s Grocery in Jinzhou. Each unit will cost 1.500 Shell Credits and you can purchase a maximum of 10 during each world rotation. Apart from its use on the draw, fish can also be used to make various recipes, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-milky-fish-soup-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milky Fish Soup</a>.</p>

It will be arriving sometime in 2024.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Do you remember <em>Fighting Force</em>? The first one was released in 1997. Reportedly, Core Design pitched it to Sega for the Saturn as <em>Streets of Rage 3D</em>. Sega passed on it. As a result, it didn’t even release for the Saturn, instead arriving on PS1 and N64.</p> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Fighting Force Collection | LRG3 Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA2GwYOIqCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It’s fun. It’s pretty loose. I don’t think anyone really had a good idea of how to do beat-’em-ups in 3D at the time, and this was no exception. Beyond just fisticuffs, there were also a lot of firearms. Honestly, I think what makes it stick out in my mind so much is its general vibe. There’s a real urban feel to its aesthetic that I love. The weirdest thing about it was that players had lives and limited continues, if I recall. Kind of a drag.</p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>Fighting Force 2</em> followed on PS1 and Dreamcast. I’m less familiar with this one because I had an N64 growing up. I’ve nearly bought the Dreamcast version on quite a few occasions in the last couple years. Contrary to the first game, the only footage I’ve seen of it takes place in some military complex. It’s also 1-player, what the hell? There’s no word if it’s the PS1 or Dreamcast version (or both) included in the collection. By the looks of it, it’s PS1.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">I’m down. They’re admittedly not great games, but I have enough affection for the era. I guess I’m saying that I really <em>want</em> to like them and am willing to attempt it again.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"><em>Fighting Force Collection</em> is coming sometime in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/dont-skip-destiny-2s-best-most-explosive-titan-exotic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dont-skip-destiny-2s-best-most-explosive-titan-exotic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="338" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Us Titan mains feel it: the tinge of disappointment in the new Prismatic subclass. We bemoan the absolute lunacy of Warlock and Hunter kits while we try to cobble together a functional build using what seem to be the worst Aspects from every subclass. But there’s still hope. We just got one of the best damage Exotics in the game. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false">How to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">The… well I won’t say <em>easiest</em>, but the most optimal (and fun) way to get Hazardous Propulsion is to complete the Final Shape campaign on Legendary difficulty. At the very end, you’ll be given an extra reward: a choice between the two new Titan Exotics. One is the Strand-focused Wishful Ignorance gauntlets, the other is the chest armor Hazardous Propulsion. </p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Wishful Ignorance is great, but does it shoot rockets out of your shoulder blades? No? Skip it for now, because the <em>other</em> way to get these new Exotics is to reset your reputation rank with Rahool in the Tower, then focus-decode an Engram into one of them. So no matter which one you choose at the end of the campaign, you’ll be able to get the other a little way down the line. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-why-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false"><em>Why</em> to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">So we’re skipping one really good Exotic for this one. Why? Well, Titans don’t exactly have excellent damage Supers, do they? What if we had access to amazing boss damage that didn’t require a Super <em>or</em> our guns? </p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">When you get kills or land precision shots, this chest piece will load rockets. Using your class ability (even Thruster, mind you) will launch up to six rockets, which hit for about 28k damage <em>each</em>. That’s pretty good already, but they also buff your rocket launcher and rocket pistols by 35% if you land all six. And that’s <em>nuts</em>. Before today’s patch, this buff is overwritten by Radiant (a 25% damage increase), but this has now been fixed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hazardous-propulsion-build-basics" data-injectable="false">Hazardous Propulsion build basics</h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">So, if you have this thing welded to your chest like I do, how do you make the most of it? Well, you’ll obviously want to use a rocket launcher in your heavy slot, and I’d suggest throwing a rocket pistol on as well. The Call, the new Strand sidearm from the Final Shape, suits this role perfectly, being kind of bonkers on its own. </p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">I’d also really suggest using Thruster, which unfortunately limits you to either an Arc or Prismatic subclass. I’d recommend Prismatic, since you’ll have a freer choice in Aspects and Fragments. The reason we’re using Thruster is its shorter cooldown and its lack of an animation: you’re going to be able to fire your buffed rockets a lot faster after casting it, and you’ll be shooting them more often. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">As a “nice to have” bonus, I’d recommend a heavy rocket with Auto-Loading Holster or Reconstruction. This way you can pop off a heavy rocket, switch to The Call, then switch back near the tail-end of the buff’s lifespan to shoot another without having to stop to reload. The damage bonus to rockets can’t really be overstated, so it’s best to get as many shots in as you can while it’s up.</p>

<p data-characters="150" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The summer is stretching on, and though it’s got some games in the pipeline, it looks like Sony won’t be showing up to Gamescom this year.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">Sony will be not showcasing at the upcoming Gamescom 2024, as confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a>, reported first by <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-2024-sony-playstation-absage/">Games Wirtschaft</a>. This makes it five years since Sony showed up at a Gamescom, back in 2019.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s not the most surprising decision, it still comes as a disappointment for those hoping to see Sony’s games at the show, especially with how the PlayStation State of Play presentation in May was received by fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Sony had revealed release dates for <em>Concord</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and the <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port during the State of Play, with all three titles set to launch this year. <em>Concord</em> will be released on August 23, which falls amid the dates for Gamescom 2024. Moreover, the release dates for <em>Astro Bot</em> (September 6) and <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port (September 19) are also not that far off.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">However, PlayStation is not the only platform skipping the major video games showcase event, as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-is-skipping-gamescom-this-year-ruling-out-a-switch-2-reveal/">Nintendo</a> will also not be present at Gamescom 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While both of those major console platforms will be a no-show, Xbox has doubled down on its commitment to Gamescom 2024. Xbox has announced that it will return for Gamescom this year, and will host its “biggest booth yet”.</p> <figure data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">Moreover, Xbox has also revealed some of the games and DLCs that they will be showcasing at Gamescom 2024. Fans can expect to hear about the following games and DLC:</p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></li> <li><em>Avowed</em></li> <li><em>Ara: History Untold</em></li> <li><em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em></li> <li><em>Diablo Immortal</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 76</em></li> <li><em>Towerborne</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em></li> </ul>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wizards of the Coast is launching two Secret Lair drops alongside the major<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-universes-beyond-assassins-creed-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering </em>set</a>. These drops will contain ten unique cards that are perfect for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> and <em>MTG</em> fans or collectors alike, bringing characters and gear to life like never before. </p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Secret Lair drops compliment major set releases with incredible artwork, additional cards, or just alternate versions of cards that fans will find when they’re opening packs. Every drop is limited, meaning only those who purchase them when available or when stocks last will ever have them. As with every other Secret Lair drop, the <em>Assassin’s Creed: Lethal Legends and DaVinci’s Designs Superdrops</em> won’t be reprinted and will be a piece of <em>MTG</em> history you can own, play with, or keep in your collection forever. </p>

These are split into two sets of five, so you can purchase either or both. I’m going to aim to get both because I love the shift in themes between the two. See below for the cards you’ll get in each set. </p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Both sets will be available from<strong> June 24, 2024, until July 14, 2024</strong>. Wizards of the Coast messed up the dates during the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uicFvwDDlBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeeklyMTG livestream</a> that revealed these cards, but Secret Lair confirmed the <a href="https://x.com/wizards_magic/status/1803141273118753054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct dates on Twitter</a>. </p>

I have to say that Basim, Master Assassin sounds crazy and if you manage to pull off a win with his ability, then you’re a tactical genius. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Eivor, Raven Clan Champion</strong>: A 3/2 Legendary Creature and Human Warrior. Whenever a Warrior attacks, you can have its controller create a 1/1 white Warrior creature token that’s tapped while attacking.

After this phase, there will be an additional combat phase, but you can only activate this ability during combat. </li> <li><strong>Altair, Brotherhood Mentor</strong>: A 2/2 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-vigilance-in-magic-the-gathering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vigilance</a> and Haste. Gets +1/+1 for every experience counter you have. Tap to deal one damage to a creature you don’t control. When that creature dies this turn, you gain another experience counter. </li> <li><strong>Amunet, Tyrants’ End</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch and Haste. When Amunet, Tyrants’ End enters the battlefield, you become the monarch. At the beginning of your upkeep, if an opponent is the monarch, create a 1/1 black Assassin creature token with Deathrouch and Haste. </li> <li><strong>Basim, Master Assassin</strong>: A 4/4 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch. Other Assassins you control get +1/+1. whenever a player loses the game, if they were attacked this turn by an Assassin you controlled, you win the game. </li> <li><strong>Edward, Jackdaw Captain</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Pirate. Other pirates you control get +1/+1. At the beginning of your end step, gain control of target nonland permanent controlled by a player who was dealt combat damage but three or more pirates this turn. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-secret-lair-x-assassin-s-creed-davinci-s-designs-superdrop-cards" data-injectable="false">All <em>Secret Lair x Assassin’s Creed: DaVinci’s Designs Superdrop</em> cards</h3> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">These five cards are all equipment, so you’ll be using them alongside those Assassins above in the inevitable <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> decks you build. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Blade of Selves</strong>: A 2 mana Artifact Equipment.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite’s latest season is as chaotic as the media that inspired it]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-latest-season-is-as-chaotic-as-the-media-that-inspired-it.907083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="O2vFWC">Chapter 5 Season 3 of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is utterly overwhelming. The first time I dropped from the Battle Bus and onto the deserted lands of Brawler’s Battleground, I couldn’t tell up from down. The stadium — which is designed to look like a monster truck rally venue — comes equipped with flamethrowers, live rock music, and stacks of spinning rip blades. After winning a desperate scramble with other players and scattered AI bots, I didn’t stop to shield up and heal. Instead, I went into my menu and turned the sound down. </p>
<p id="XpUcJj">As it turns out, that flurry of activity in those opening moments came to characterize the general vibe of <em>Fortnite</em>’s latest big update. Dubbed “Wrecked,” this season pushes <em>Fortnite </em>away from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23990967/fortnite-chapter-5-season-1-map-too-fancy">posh European locales</a> and instead creates an anarchic wasteland inspired by the likes of the Fallout games and, seemingly, Mad Max. Take those two franchises as starting inspiration points, then layer on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season">hefty serving of Metallica on top</a>, and the results are a gameplay experience that’s caked in chaotic sludge — so much so that it might weigh down the fun at some points. </p>
<p id="VqjJZX">The update is absolutely littered with new items. There are the Nitro Fists, which can melee through even the fiercest opponents with an explosion of power. There’s a new set of Medallions, which you pick up after boss fights and use to give yourself powerful buffs. There are the Lockjaw battle cars, which can plow through anything and contain mounted turrets. </p>
<p id="hs8fhI">If you don’t get one of the battle cars, that’s fine, because the map is literally covered with other vehicles you can modify, Flaming Boost Hoops that can send you zooming across the map (or into another player, if you so wish), and items like the Ride the Lightning guitar that allow you to soar through the sky. If you yourself want to become a weapon, no problem. The plentiful Nitro Splash allows your character to run through buildings and destroy them with a simple jump into the Splash. </p>

<p id="tQ55b0">This results in moments that feel either bad to lose or worse to win. I had one moment where I was just chilling on a mountain, looting a chest, when a player came up from the other side of the hill. I panicked and spammed the Nitro Fists and won with little to no finesse. </p>
<p id="5ledYD">At one point, I tried to attack an opponent driving a car and I missed. I backed up like a mom driving her kids to soccer in a minivan and missed again. I then looped around to try to hit them again and indeed I did. It landed enough damage that I could hop out and clean up the kill with a bit of gunfire. On the flip side, I was once looting a building quietly until someone amped up on Nitro Splash boosted through the entire building and yeeted me to another dimension, leading me to take some fall damage and making for an easy kill from their teammate in a car. </p>
<p id="AtX0bI">For better or worse, the developers successfully captured the spirit of anarchy this season. If you’re a casual player who just wants to mess around with friends, the pace of each match can ramp up in the blink of an eye as vehicles descend upon you and smash you to smithereens. If you play competitively, it’s less enjoyable — I’ve seen many posts online lamenting the sheer number and strength of new gimmicks at play here. My regular partner in duos has already decided he’s going to sit this season out based on a few play sessions. I don’t blame him, because it’s a lot, and a constantly irritated fan base appears to be the new norm for <em>Fortnite</em>. However, I can’t help but feel it’s all still very, well... <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>

<p id="7FXV4g">This is the same team that decided to take building, the titular and most original game mechanic in the game, and make it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23271397/fortnite-zero-build-battle-royale">an optional feature</a>.

Sure, but <em>Fortnite </em>has often had a Mario Kart blue shell logic to it all — that is, that any person can swoop in and win at the last moment — and that helps keep the game interesting to players of all levels. At the moment, it feels like the balance may be tipped a bit too far toward chaos. </p>

For the most part, posts in the <em>Helldivers </em>subreddit have been pretty tame though, which might honestly be due to the goodwill of the last big patch to hit the game. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>used to have frequent patches and fixes that seemed to solve one issue and cause several more, which eventually added up over the course of several months.

<p>In June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally worldwide and forever changed the playing field where handheld gaming devices were concerned. Following in the ever-so-successful footsteps of Valve’s Steam Deck, Asus cornered a fair portion of the market by introducing a Windows 11-powered device with a white-hot processor and a gorgeous aesthetic – but it wasn’t without its teething issues.</p>



<p>Fast forward an entire year and the Asus ROG Ally is still at the top of the table – but it has been joined by some tough competition. In the last few months, the Lenovo Legion Go and the MSI Claw have entered the battlefield, and even a <strong>new </strong>ROG Ally model has surfaced – the ‘ROG Ally X’. </p>



<p>One year on, is the Asus ROG Ally still worth your money?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-powerful-playing">Powerful Playing</h2>



<p>With a Windows 11 OS as standard, the Asus ROG Ally is and forever will be a versatile and highly dynamic device. If you were to pair it with a wireless keyboard and mouse, you’ve got yourself a low-powered gaming PC. It can run more or less any launcher, and while some games are finicky in terms of compatibility, almost anything can be played on the device. It also supports every application you can install on a laptop or a PC, which is another huge bonus.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with the Asus ROG Ally for a few months, and it’s so rare that I’ve had a bad experience. The biggest drawback is the unit’s battery, which flakes out after playing a ‘good’ game for more than 45 minutes. On charge, you can boost the ROG Ally into ‘Turbo Mode’ and keep playing for hours, but then you’ll need to contend with a little heat source in the palms of your hands.</p>



<p>From Fallout 4 to Escape from Tarkov and from Modern Warfare 3 to Days Gone, I’ve played quite a mix of games on the Asus ROG Ally. It’s a powerful device considering its size, but on plenty of occasions, I had to drop the quality of these games right down to the bottom to produce a stable and consistent experience – but that’s not a huge issue, as almost everything looks good on the 1080p, 7-inch touchscreen (which boasts a 120hz refresh rate).</p>



<p>The AMD RDNA-powered GPU and the 16 GB of RAM are enough to run most modern games, but the upgraded model is the one to go for if you want the best experience possible. In the Asus ROG Ally X, there’s a 1 TB NVMe SSD and 24 GB of RAM, plus a battery that boasts twice as much power.</p>



<p>However, the original Asus ROG Ally can still use the ROG XG Mobile eGPU to take advantage of the equivalent of an RTX 3070 GPU, while the ROG Ally X <strong>cannot</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-getting-to-grips">Getting to Grips</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In your hands, the Asus ROG Ally still feels very nice, even after months of use. It’s a sleek device that has a nice splash of RGB front and centre, which appeals to the gamer in all of us. The face buttons are a good size and are tactile, and the whole setup is made to mimic an Xbox or a PlayStation controller, right down to the sloped triggers and large, curved shoulder buttons. The thumbsticks are ‘full-sized’ and grippy, and the additional buttons that are there to accommodate extra inputs plus shortcuts to the onboard software are run-of-the-mill but on-theme.</p>



<p>With a stereo speaker setup boasting Dolby Atmos, the included sound system is decent enough, but I paired the ROG Ally with a Bluetooth headset to get the best experience possible. </p>



<p>Now that the ROG Ally X is on the market, you should be able to land a good deal on the Asus ROG Ally OG unit, but it’s best to get in quickly before stock dries up forever. It’s a solid gaming machine with fantastic multi-tasking potential, and it’s easily one of the best-looking devices out of the bunch when sat alongside the Lenovo Legion Go, the MSI Claw, or the Steam Deck. Even a year after launch, I still find myself using it a few times a week when travelling or simply lounging on the sofa and not wanting to drag myself to my PC.</p>



<p>I’ll keep hold of my ROG Ally until it gives up on me, basically.</p>

The team at Limited Run has built a new collection to find the answer. <em>Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</em> explores the franchise’s troubled history and enduring popularity.</p><p><em>Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</em> is a playable history that includes games, artifacts and interviews. All of the games have been carefully updated for modern PCs and consoles using Limited Run’s proprietary Carbon Engine. Along the way the team was able to smooth out some of the games’ rough edges.</p><p>At the helm of the project is Limited Run’s Audi Sorlie, a producer, author, Bubsy World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the world’s foremost expert on the furry franchise. Together with the team at Limited Run and Atari, he has created the ultimate retrospective celebration of Bubsy, the 3’6” tall 80 pound bobcat (with a pet armadillo named Arnold). What could possibly go wrong?</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_894405"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>What is the Carbon Engine?</strong></p><p>Created internally at Limited Run Games, the Carbon Engine is a development tool that allows legacy content to be ported to modern platforms. It uses emulation as a base, on top of which the Carbon Engine builds features like UI, rendering, audio, data management, controller inputs, and console-specific SDK features like trophies. It allows Limited Run to put out highly accurate, emulation-based ports of classic games for modern hardware. Old, well-loved releases can find a second wind on all-new hardware using the Carbon Engine. It is a core component of Limited Run’s vision for a world that is Forever Physical.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike previous entries in the series, The Veilguard's combat system is focused on real-time combat, with tactical combat taking a bit of a backseat. Players can only take two companions with them at a time (down from three in previous titles) and can no longer directly control those companions in combat. Instead, players can pause time by pulling up an ability wheel that allows them to choose which ability they want to use next, and also select which actions their companions take in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare general manager Gary McKay echoed Darrah's statements, adding, "I've seen [The Veilguard's combat system] refined over time, [and] I love it. I love that balance of real-time fluid action, but also the ability to have the depth in the RPG, not just in terms of pause-and-play, but the depth in terms of how you bring your companions into the battlefield. What are you going to do with their skill points? What's the loadout you're going to use? Everything is about bringing Rook to the center of the battlefield, and I love it."</p><p>The Veilguard is set to release sometime in Fall 2024.

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Money is what it’s all about in the real world, but also in <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em>. While you can complete endless heists to earn more cash or perhaps just steal it from pedestrians, you can also take your existing money to Wall Street and invest in the in-game stocks. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Stocks are a great way to easily amass a fortune to buy as many <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-sell-cars-in-gta-5/">cars</a>, planes, and boats as you want. Better yet, they can be manipulated by in-game choices during the story, in both the BAWSAQ and LCN when you’re playing story mode. What are the best stocks to invest in when you’re playing <em>GTA 5</em>? We’re here to let you know.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gta-5-liberty-city-national-stock-exchange.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Rockstar </figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-stocks-earn-you-the-most-money-in-gta-5" data-injectable="false">What stocks earn you the most money in GTA 5?</h2> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">These are the top stocks you can buy into when you’re playing <em>GTA 5</em>. When played correctly, they have the highest return rate. These should be used in tandem with Lester’s Assassination Missions since they specifically target important figures in the market, like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-register-as-ceo-in-gta-5-guide/">CEOs</a>, to manipulate the market how you want. You’ll get the most return when you invest in these properly:</p> <h3 id="h-1-betta-pharmaceuticals" data-injectable="false">1. Betta Pharmaceuticals</h3> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">Betta Pharmaceuticals is the company you’ll want to invest in during The Hotel Assassination, specifically on the BAWSAQ. Make sure to invest in the company before you start the mission to get the best return.&nbsp;It will return the highest rate right when the assassination is complete.</p>
 <h3 id="h-2-debonaire" data-injectable="false">2. Debonaire </h3> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">Much like Betta, you’ll want to invest in this company before you start The Multi-Target Assassination. However, make sure to do it on the LCN instead. This is how you’ll get the most cash when it’s time to sell the stock back.</p> <h3 id="h-3-fruit-computers" data-injectable="false">3. Fruit Computers</h3> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Fruit Computers is best invested in before The Vice Assassination mission begins. When you do this, make sure to invest money with all three characters for the best return. You’ll also want to invest in the BAWSAQ for this stock.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-gold-coast" data-injectable="false">4. Gold Coast</h3> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">Gold Coast should, once again, be bought into right before you begin the mission, The Construction Assassination. Buy into the Gold Coast stock specifically on the LCN for the best return.</p> <h3 id="h-5-bilkinton-research" data-injectable="false">5. Bilkinton Research</h3> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Bilkinton is a bit different, as you won’t want to invest in this stock until <em>after</em> you finish the mission, specifically The Hotel Assassination. You get the best results when you invest it right after you sell the stock from Betta. Invest in Bilkinton on the LCN.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-redwood-cigarettes" data-injectable="false">6. Redwood Cigarettes </h3> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Once again you’ll want to invest this after you’ve sold your stock that you invested before you begin The Multi-Target Assassination, which is Debonaire. Once the mission is completed, invest in Redwood on the LCN. This stock is the most important since you’ll get the most return for your work. If you’re going to invest in only one stock, make it Redwood Cigarettes.</p> <h3 id="h-7-facade" data-injectable="false">7. Façade</h3> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">Buy into Façade after you complete The Vice Assassination. For this stock, you will want to invest on the BAWSAQ exchange for the best return.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-vapid" data-injectable="false">8. Vapid</h3> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">The final stock you’ll want to invest in to make money is Vapid. Put your money into this stock on the BAWSAQ after you’ve completed The Bus Assassination to get the most money in return.</p> <h2 id="h-when-should-you-sell-your-stock-in-gta-5" data-injectable="false">When should you sell your stock in GTA 5?</h2> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">When you should sell your stock is dependent on which stock you invested in, between the LCN and BAWSAQ. Here’s what you need to know about both:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>LCN: </strong>This stock will peak in value a day after you complete the assassination mission or 24 in-game hours. It will begin to decline after that point but will go back up to peak value around a week after the assassination. Any time after this will be lower than the maximum return you can get on it.</li> <li><strong>BAWSAQ: </strong>This stock goes up faster, peaking directly after the assassination is complete. After 24 in-game hours, the price will begin to decline. It will bounce back about two or three days after the assassination mission again but will go back down afterward.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">If you follow the rules of which stock to sell and when and where to sell it, you’ll be able to make quite a fortune. This is by far the best method to interact with stocks in <em>GTA 5</em> and guarantees you a good return. Stocks are a great way to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-money-fast-in-gta-5/">make money</a>, however, I recommend pulling off these market manipulations when you have more cash to get a higher return. </p>

<p data-characters="425" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the Monopoly Games seasons starting today in <em>Monopoly GO</em>, we have several sports-related features to enjoy, with the Fortune Footrace banner event being one of many new additions. With the opportunity to get plenty of stickers for an early start on the new season’s album sets, you may very well get lucky and finish a few in one fell swoop. Let’s check out the entire list of Fortune Footrace event rewards.</p>  <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Fortune Footrace event has 44 rewards you can obtain until June 22, 2024. Collecting enough points to complete every tier rewards you with 19,615 dice and 14 sticker packs, making this a solid opportunity to obtain more cards than usual. Below is every Fortune Footrace event reward.</p> <figure data-found-rows="44" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="2363" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Event Level</th><th>Points Required</th><th data-align="center">Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr data-index="0"><td>1</td><td>5</td><td data-align="center">One-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="1"><td>2</td><td>10</td><td data-align="center">30 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="2"><td>3</td><td>15</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr data-index="3"><td>4</td><td>60</td><td data-align="center">75 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="4"><td>5</td><td>20</td><td data-align="center">One-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="5"><td>6</td><td>20</td><td data-align="center">15 minutes of Mega Heist</td></tr><tr data-index="6"><td>7</td><td>5</td><td data-align="center">60 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="7"><td>8</td><td>30</td><td data-align="center">Two-Star Sticker Pack</td></tr><tr data-index="8"><td>9</td><td>200</td><td data-align="center">250 Dice Rolls</td></tr><tr data-index="9" data-injectable="true"><td>10</td><td>30</td><td data-align="center">Cash</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">

 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Since there are more sticker packs than usual during this event, you have two possible strategies: progressing as quickly as possible to wrap up your <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-making-music-album-stickers-and-rewards-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making Music album sets</a> or wait a few minutes for the new season to roll by. Either way, there are more dice, card packs, and power-up rewards than usual, with the required points also being much lower than previous banner events of a similar nature.</p>
  <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">Gaining points during the Fortune Footrace event requires landing on Chance, Community Chest, and Railroad tiles. Below is the points breakdown for each:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"> <li>Chance: Two points</li> <li>Community Chest: Three points</li> <li>Railroad: Five points</li> </ul> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="false">The best tile you can land on is the railroad space. Not only does it reward the most points toward this event, but you’ll also gain progress toward ongoing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-row-rally-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tournaments like Row Rally</a>. Chance is a close second, as it can send you to the nearest railroad. Take advantage of dice rewards and power-ups like High Roller to increase your dice limits as the points from these tiles scale with your dice multiplier.</p>

The policy, laid out in the company’s <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report</a>, is all the greatest hits of the dumbest ideas about our dumbest tech craze, made by the dumbest guys you know.</p><p>First off: if anyone knows less about “human-centric” approaches to anything, it’s Embracer, the company that gobbled up a chunk of the games industry and then flushed it down the toilet, closing studios, cancelling games, and laying off employees at a breakneck pace since that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saudi money fell through</a>. <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Humans have been paying the price</a> for the company’s fuck-ups since; I sincerely doubt that the ethical concerns it professes to see with AI are the thing that’s suddenly going to make it pivot into, you know, giving a shit about people. Embracer writes that “We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” a goal it could meet without any bullshit technology by just letting people keep their jobs, but where’s the fun in that?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Embracer writes that “one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players.” This is arguably true, in that as every company jumps off the <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI cliff</a>, Embracer wouldn’t want to miss out on the chance to join the lemming herd. What does it see as these advantages? The usual bullshit: “scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more.”&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s my favorite part:</p><blockquote><p>And, as models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Groundbreaking! We’ve definitely never had a game be able to r<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/35lr3h/where_does_will_remember_that_come_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emember what you’ve done</a> in previous situations before. How would developers ever be able to <a href="https://x.com/qorquiq/status/1803816368896135675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">code something so complicated</a> without the help of AI, a technology that can’t do any of the things it promises it can <em>yet</em>, but which can only get there if we keep <a href="https://aftermath.site/humane-ai-marques-brownlee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tinkerbell clapping</a> for it despite the <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a>. If we stay the course, if we keep pumping money and hype into the plagiarism machine, if companies of all kinds keep <a href="https://futurism.com/washington-post-pivot-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoting</a> their <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ea-studios-hunger-to-start-using-generative-ai-as-quickly-as-possible-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">models</a> to embrace it (sorry), at some unspecified point in the future, Embracer will be able to lead the way in a technology that was a <a href="https://www.quora.com/In-Telltale-Games-what-does-it-mean-when-it-says-X-character-will-remember-that" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme</a> in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Embracer has been at the forefront of bad decisions, innovating new horrors in both games industry consolidation and the destruction that comes from that consolidation. I’m heartened to see that it won’t be left in the dust on this either.

Ubisoft has released a trailer for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition </em>that confirms it’ll arrive next Tuesday, June 25th — just five days after I write these words. </p><p>I hope it stands up because I remember it as a phenomenal game. Jade and her pig buddy Pey’j were memorable characters with a remarkably lived-in sci-fi world, where you wield a camera and a mean stick rather than resorting to gunplay. It struck enough of a chord that gamers have been clamoring for a sequel ever since — but <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em> has now been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557146/beyond-good-and-evil-2-not-canceled-development-hell">stuck in development hell</a> for 15 years, longer than even the infamous <em>Duke Nukem Forever.</em></p><div><figcaption><em>The camera is your most important tool in BG&amp;E.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ubisoft</cite></p></div><p>Here’s how Ubisoft’s trailer description describes the <em>20th Anniversary Edition</em> remaster:</p><div><blockquote><p>Embark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60fps with improved graphics, controls and audio.

And Ubisoft also appears to have <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/beyond-good-evil-delisted-ahead-of-20th-anniversary-editions-reveal-this-week/">delisted the original game from Steam</a>, though — as usual — existing owners like me can still download it just fine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182478/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-fan-art-memes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CR8mSd">Nintendo has revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">Princess Zelda will lead as the playable protagonist</a> in the newly announced game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>. Instead of swinging the iconic Master Sword, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">Zelda wields the Tri Rod</a>, a magical tool that can allow her to replicate items and creatures from the larger environment. Now, anything from a wooden table to a monster can be summoned by Zelda to explore the world, solve puzzles, and fight. </p>
<p id="lra3Nv">Using materials in unexpected ways isn’t exactly anything new for The Legend of Zelda fans.    If anything, the sandbox elements of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23718684/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-switch-totk"><em>Tears of Kingdom</em></a><em> </em>already pushed this way of playing to the max. Anything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">a pile of logs</a> to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/13xxxjs/did_you_know_that_you_can_attach_icy_meat_to_your/">frozen slab of meat</a> could be viable materials for building zany contraptions. However, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>revives the charm and humor of using unconventional tools to save Hyrule. Mainly, it’s just great to think about the princess aggressively saving Link from his death by wielding nothing but a chair and a kitchen table. </p>
<p id="5GzQpy">Now fans have filled X with posts and fan art celebrating the protagonist and her newfound set of magical powers. This first piece of art portrays the enormous potential of “table power,” but you can scroll on to see more. </p>







<p id="UP0fqi">Based on the gameplay demonstration shown on Tuesday, Zelda needs to be able to see and scan an item first with her rod before she can replicate it. I don’t think there are any guns in Hyrule, but that hasn’t stopped fans from fans imagining what could happen if she were able to create one.</p>


<p id="y6EiHs">Part of the trailer showed Zelda carrying a hefty rock, so a lot of the art reimagines the moment where the tiny princess picks up the large boulder. </p>


<p id="FyK1QV">And then if good old goofs and memes are your game, well there are already plenty of those too. Here are two of the funniest ones we found. </p>


<p id="i23voC"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is coming out on Nintendo Switch on Sept. 26.  </p>

<p id="KQk6J5">• Hero Mastery Gauntlet Co-op has been removed.</p>
<h3 id="cOljqr"><strong>New Map: Runasapi</strong></h3>
<p id="Fy2ka8">Hike your way up the new Runasapi Push map, to a town hidden high in the Peruvian Andes. Amble through marketplaces full of fresh produce and pay a visit to the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. This exciting Push map is vibrant and challenging as you escort TS-1 through tight streets. Watch out as some fights may take place precariously close to the steep cliffs overlooking the sunny farmlands below.</p>
<h3 id="KnYvBD"><strong>Challenge Updates</strong></h3>
<p id="gFIXts"><strong>Weekly Challenge Catch Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="nzz8Mb">All past incomplete Weekly Challenges can be completed at any time in a given season.</li>
<li id="cbVNcW">When the Weekly Reset occurs on Tuesdays, incomplete Weekly Challenges gain an additional copy of that challenge. When a Weekly Challenge is completed, if that challenge has copies remaining, the Challenge will refresh and can be completed again.</li>
</ul>
<p id="TLcYth"><strong>Weekly Milestones</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="AG0C4I">Weekly Milestones are challenges progressed by completing other Weekly Challenges.</li>
<li id="H78M8v">Each week, a new Weekly Milestone is unlocked. All past Weekly Milestones can be completed at any time in a given season.</li>
<li id="oTdEFP">Weekly Milestones progress one at a time. All past Weekly Milestones must be completed to progress a Weekly Milestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Qn6gA1"><strong>Competitive Play Updates</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="MIMa9T">Rank Percentage is now displayed on the Competitive Progress page allowing you to check your exact percentage without playing another match.</li>
<li id="TWx4dP">Renamed the Modifiers “Win Streak” and “Loss Streak” to “Win Trend” and “Loss Trend” to more accurately convey that these modifiers are calculated by weighing the most recent games more heavily, but that they are not true streaks.</li>
<li id="HwbENL">Added more parameters for how the matchmaker handles wide groups, so that it can ensure better queue times.</li>
<li id="G5qnyN">A button that allows you to view the match’s final Scoreboard has been added to each page during the end-of-game flow.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qE696k"><strong>Hero Updates</strong></h3>
<h4 id="TRTQzC"><strong>General</strong></h4>
<ul><li id="EriyHW">Knockdown time when two charging abilities collide reduced from 2 to 1.7 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="uFBbKH"><em>Developer Comments: This stun time reduction applies to the knockdown that happens when two charging abilities collide and result in a tie (with Reinhardt, Doomfist, Brigitte, Mauga, Bob). The counterplay and interaction of two charging abilities impacting each other is great, but it took both players out of the fight a little too long.</em></p>
<h4 id="tpA2h9"><strong>Tank</strong></h4>
<p id="U1cObz"><strong>D.Va</strong></p>
<p id="gpCgp5">Boosters</p>
<ul><li id="1QARct">Impact damage increased from 15 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="EitHDk">Fusion Cannons</p>
<ul><li id="wG2PLp">Weapon spread reduced from 3.75 to 3.375 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="tZBRsO"><em>Developer Comments: These changes will improve D.Va’s effectiveness against smaller targets as she became less effective against armored enemies in the previous patch.</em></p>
<p id="73GHwc"><strong>Junker Queen</strong></p>
<p id="7jbpS2">Rampage</p>
<ul><li id="UeNGlR">Startup time reduced from 0.75 to 0.5 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="Ni6H4N">Jagged Blade</p>
<ul><li id="5BuGAO">Now pulls tanks further.</li></ul>
<p id="cnBI6z"><em>Developer Comments: The Tank knockback resistance passive was affecting Junker Queen’s pull effect more than intended. The distance can be affected by their movement, but Tanks are now pulled in about 5-6 meters instead of only 3 meters or so.</em></p>
<p id="CX6CAN"><strong>Orisa</strong></p>
<p id="pVz6FB">Javelin Spin</p>
<ul><li id="7I8uEW">Cooldown reduced from 9 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="SJpIuH"><em>Developer Comments: Orisa’s survivability was reduced more than necessary in her last round of changes so we’re partially reverting the cooldown increase to Javelin Spin.</em></p>
<p id="FFPpVy"><strong>Roadhog</strong></p>
<ul><li id="SNTbMk">Base health reduced from 650 to 600.</li></ul>
<p id="2I5VMq">Take a Breather</p>
<ul><li id="nPO7KB">Damage reduction reduced from 50% to 40%.</li></ul>
<p id="Y84hNM"><em>Developer Comments: Roadhog’s already-powerful survivability increased significantly with the headshot damage reduction from the tank role passive so these changes are to help bring that back in line.</em></p>
<h4 id="XnAMqM">Damage</h4>
<p id="kqLp3Q"><strong>Cassidy</strong></p>
<p id="jaGoRR">Flashbang</p>
<ul>
<li id="c0ZJKk">Magnetic Grenade ability is now Flashbang.</li>
<li id="wA7PFn">Hinders enemies instead of Stunning them for 1.2 seconds.</li>
<li id="NdsMNL">Movement speed reduction increased from 30% to 50%.</li>
<li id="0WYdRD">Hinder now prevents crouching movement.</li>
<li id="J5rhVX">45 explosive damage.</li>
<li id="AviSwm">12 second cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Va7LOZ">Deadeye</p>
<ul>
<li id="BfpfLN">Movement speed penalty now scales down over time, from 70% to 35%.</li>
<li id="G1dPqd">Damage reduction now scales down over time, from 40% to 0%.</li>
</ul>
<p id="zlSSfz">Combat Roll</p>
<ul><li id="qo9HaG">Damage reduction reduced from 75% to 50%.</li></ul>
<p id="NFtYP1">Peacekeeper</p>
<ul><li id="BWmTYT">Secondary fire “Fan the Hammer” damage reduced from 50 to 45.</li></ul>
<p id="IuKmiM"><em>Developer Comments: We’re reverting the Magnetic Grenade ability to be deployed like Cassidy’s previous Flashbang ability, but it will keep the Hinder effect instead of a full stun. We’ve heard feedback surrounding the Magnetic Grenade ability and agree that while the fantasy of a homing grenade was fun, the moment-to-moment gameplay of it often felt too unpredictable as to whether it would land or not. The Hinder effect has been a useful tool to act as a counter to highly mobile heroes without going back to a full stun and the enemy player losing the ability to fight back.</em></p>
<p id="UaPTCS"><em>The Deadeye ultimate is getting an adjustment to increase its flexibility toward the end of its duration, enabling it to get value outside of buying time for Cassidy or his allies, though it may be riskier to hold it for a long time as the damage reduction will fade away along with the movement speed penalty.</em></p>
<p id="d662B5"><strong>Mei</strong></p>
<p id="vYfCU4">Endothermic Blaster</p>
<ul>
<li id="xK0Bvf">Secondary fire base projectile size reduced from 0.15 to 0.12 meters.</li>
<li id="pGItN3">Secondary fire damage increased from 75 to 85.</li>
</ul>
<p id="KPItKb"><em>Developer Comments: Mei’s damage output over time is intended to be on the low end for a Damage hero, as she offers strong utility and survivability through her ability kit, but we would like to make the secondary fire icicle more rewarding by increasing the damage and slightly more difficult to land consistently.</em></p>
<p id="aOAH0a"><strong>Reaper</strong></p>
<p id="v1LhpF">Hellfire Shotguns</p>
<ul><li id="Q9pD3p">Weapon spread reduced from 6.5 to 6 degrees.</li></ul>
<p id="WDruLK">Shadow Step</p>
<ul><li id="azKZOP">Cast time reduced from 1.5 to 1.2 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="X5sCSK"><em>Developer Comments: With the previous patch change to how armor reduces damage, shotgun weapon heroes like Reaper lost some value since much of their game plan revolved around pressuring large tank heroes. To help shift Reaper toward being more effective against smaller targets we’re tightening the weapon spread on the Hellfire Shotguns and reducing the amount of time enemies have to react to his Shadow Step teleport.</em></p>
<p id="fujuZW"><strong>Sojourn</strong></p>
<p id="rveKNz">Railgun</p>
<ul>
<li id="MQjuKd">Secondary fire damage scaling reduced from 30-130 damage down to 1-100 damage.</li>
<li id="IvJHGh">Secondary fire projectile no longer requires Overclock to pierce enemy players.</li>
<li id="hyxEIo">Primary fire shots per second increased from 14 to 16.</li>
</ul>
<p id="OA2rK1">Overclock</p>
<ul><li id="cJu1Ay">Energy charge rate increased from 100 to 120 per second.</li></ul>
<p id="2clk2t"><em>Developer Comments: This change is reducing the burst damage potential of the secondary fire Railgun shot to both lessen frustration from playing against that burst damage, and to shift power into her sustained primary fire damage. This should smooth out the feast-or-famine nature of Sojourn consistently hitting the secondary fire shots.</em></p>
<p id="jTlZYW"><strong>Symmetra</strong></p>
<ul><li id="Li3Pci">Base health increased from 100 to 125 (Total health increased from 250 to 275).</li></ul>
<p id="KrPQx0">Photon Projector</p>
<ul><li id="3UQHpH">Primary fire charge rate increased 25%.</li></ul>
<p id="d7hNzQ"><em>Developer Comments: To help solidify Symmetra as a close-range threat, we’re increasing her health to better survive in that range, along with how quickly her primary fire beam damage ramps up.</em></p>
<h4 id="eEaDYb"><strong>Support</strong></h4>
<p id="kdqss0"><strong>Illari</strong></p>
<p id="VFDsRg">Healing Pylon</p>
<ul>
<li id="9aaoZ2">Healing per projectile increased from 30 to 40.</li>
<li id="sGCiC4">Pylon healing is now only half as effective when targeting Illari.</li>
<li id="isicGW">Max health increased from 100 to 125.</li>
</ul>
<p id="QgJySW">Outburst</p>
<ul><li id="Iv0Jpk">Damage increased from 10 to 25.</li></ul>
<p id="1nEHMS"><em>Developer Comments: Illari’s Healing Pylon is intended to be useful for healing her team in relatively safe positions without much focus required, which enables her to either apply pressure with her primary fire or spot heal in bursts from her more limited secondary fire healing beam. To encourage this, it now has improved health and healing output, but is less effective when Illari uses it to heal herself.</em></p>
<p id="8V5eR0"><strong>Kiriko</strong></p>
<p id="qZrvHT">Protection Suzu</p>
<ul><li id="nlK4lY">No longer cleanses hard knockdown stuns.</li></ul>
<p id="cieNGT">Swift Step</p>
<ul><li id="fCdWcV">Cooldown increased from 7 to 8 seconds.</li></ul>
<p id="TsNH1X"><em>Developer Comments: “Hard knockdown stuns” refer to most all of the existing knockdowns where the player is stunned and laying on the ground (such as Reinhardt’s Earthshatter), with the exception of Ana’s Sleep Dart effect, which is removed upon taking damage or Protection Suzu’s cleanse.</em></p>
<h3 id="hKTg2i"><strong>Map Updates</strong></h3>
<p id="BtQQcF"><strong>Colosseo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="Sd7HGU">Removed the glass and added stairs at first checkpoint for additional pathing and combat opportunities.</li>
<li id="1Rq0vp">Extended the map with a new lowered section and mega health pack behind the second checkpoint for flank/rotational strategies</li>
<li id="8BRFUa">Added a route through a building that connects spawn/final point to second checkpoint.</li>
<li id="C6z2DG">The initial spawn building has been pulled back to give players more room to smoothly navigate the area out front. There is no added run back time with this change.</li>
<li id="jph9o8">The stairs and cover surrounding the final point have been adjusted to improve the flow of the space and to help teams safely defend the final point.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Aij2Zm"><strong>Push Game Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="qEydHw">Reduced the match time from 10 minutes to 8 minutes in Quick Play.</li>
<li id="ipWozc">Increased push robot speed by 10% when pushing the barricade for both Quick Play and Competitive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6xg75k"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>
<h4 id="eDMCZz"><strong>Maps</strong></h4>
<p id="yMb4A2"><strong>Numbani</strong></p>
<ul><li id="XfwAPZ">Fixed pieces of the environment that allowed abilities to pass through it.</li></ul>
<p id="Mj7qZa"><strong>New Junk City</strong></p>
<ul><li id="4x4Hn6">Fixed lighting in some areas of the map.</li></ul>
<p id="gB2UWc"><strong>Hollywood</strong></p>
<ul><li id="PIFKvD">Fixed areas of the map that could cause players to become temporarily stuck.</li></ul>
<h4 id="GKq1xv"><strong>Heroes</strong></h4>
<p id="Sxm6qN"><strong>Junker Queen</strong></p>
<ul><li id="yzsAW4">Fixed a bug that caused Junker Queen’s Commanding Shout to play the audio again when using a Teleporter.</li></ul>
<p id="cjFIdO"><strong>Reinhardt</strong></p>
<ul><li id="AB93bB">Charge now correctly damages Ice Wall and Tree of Life.</li></ul>
<p id="pTXE4Y"><strong>Venture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li id="XFUvN1">Fixed an interaction that allowed Venture to stay burrowed indefinitely.• Fixed the description of Drill Dash to match its functionality.</li>
<li id="PDs82p">Fixed a bug with Tectonic Shock that could allow it to charge Venture’s Ultimate Meter some situations.</li>
</ul>
<p id="Z7SoYc"><strong>Zarya</strong></p>
<ul><li id="utaVTD">Fixed an interaction where a Particle Shielded Zarya standing on a Teleporter could prevent teammates from using the teleporter.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/green-hell-6-million-sales/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Green Hell was first released back in 2019, joining an ever-growing line-up of open-world survival titles that pitted players against the elements. Green Hell’s draw was that it was more realistic than its competitors, boasting unique elements that required players to manage both their mental and physical health while they navigated a massive jungle and fought to survive. </p>



<p>It was just revealed by the game’s developer, Creepy Jar, that the title has surpassed six million sales since being released in 2018, averaging a cool 1.2 million sales per year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-learn-to-survive">Learn to Survive</h2>



<p>Green Hell was well-reviewed when it dropped in 2019, and since then, it landed on a few more platforms, coming to Nintendo Switch in 2020 and then winding up on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2021. The staggered release pattern served the game well, with the player count remaining relatively consistent as free updates were deployed by Creepy Jar.</p>



<p>In April, the team pushed out the twentieth free update for the game, introducing new animals, survival mechanics, and construction blueprints. In the years that have followed since the game’s launch, the developers have introduced controller support, a cooperative story mode, an achievements system, farming, countless building features, and new enemies. That’s not bad considering the game always seems to be on sale somewhere for just a few dollars.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Survival games like Green Hell have blown up in recent years. Titles like Sons of the Forest, Valheim, ARK, Subnautica, Raft, SCUM, and V Rising all found popularity in the market for their intense levels of freedom, base-building mechanics, and at times challenging combat sequences.</p>
