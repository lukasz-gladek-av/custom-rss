            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-features-much-greater-reactivity-and-third-person-view-says-obsidian/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the Xbox Games Showcase 2025, where The Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> its official launch date, Obsidian dedicated a good portion of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M3QwLBrg8g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Direct</a> (which also featured Grounded 2) to the upcoming action RPG sequel.</p>
<p>Creative Director Leonard Boyarsky highlighted that the game has benefited from having a bigger budget and more time in development. This allows The Outer Worlds 2 to be a much more 'true Obsidian reactive RPG' compared to the original The Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>Skills and traits are also even more important now. They not only affect combat, but also conversations and areas that the developers are calling 'RPG interactions'. In these instances, players will be able to use their skills, perks, and backgrounds to solve challenges in many different ways.</p>
<p>While the previous installment pitted players as the Stranger, essentially a blank slate character for players to fill, this time, Obsidian is giving more structure to the player character's background. They are an Earth Directorate agent, whom the developers compared to space marshals. However, players will still get to choose why they joined the Earth Directorate, with options such as Ex-Convict, Gambler, Lawbringer, Professor, Renegade, and Roustabout.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 won't have attributes. Obsidian leaned into traits for this sequel because they wanted more meaningful changes. Some of those shown in the Direct include Lucky, which provides a 5% higher critical chance and opens up certain opportunities, and Nimble, which increases crouch speed and combat sprint speed by 25%. However, you can also select negative traits, like Dumb, which locks five of the twelve available skills from being upgraded at all and also adds a few appropriate conversation options. Selecting a negative trait lets you add an extra positive trait.</p>
<p>After traits, players pick skills, which are the backbone of your character's play style. Examples include Speech, Sneak, Science, Observation, Guns, Melee and more. Additionally, Obsidian is essentially 'borrowing' the perk system for Fallout: New Vegas while also expanding on it. For example, Pickpocket lets you steal from NPCs, while Heavy Handed empowers melee power attacks with a knockdown (which has an internal cooldown to maintain balance). There's even a Serial Killer perk that adds a chance for killed humans to drop their hearts; consuming the hearts provides a permanent max health bonus.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 also brings back the Flaw system. These are also trait-like things that define your character with pros and cons. For example, Bad Knees lets you move faster but also produces a loud popping noise whenever you rise up from crouch, alerting nearby enemies. Sungazer makes weapon spread 100% worse, but also gives the player character continuous healing while outside during the day (up to 50% health). Overprepared increases the size of all weapon magazines by 50%, but also inflicts a 40% debuff for 8 seconds if you completely empty a magazine.</p>
<p>When it comes to reactivity, players will be given all sorts of options when dealing with obstacles. For example, they'll have to cross a heavily patrolled bridge area at some point, and one of the available options is to make a deal with those non-player characters who patrol it by sacrificing one of the companions (of which there are six). Of course, doing so may have serious repercussions even with the relationship with the remaining companions.</p>

<p>Obsidian also touched on the colony of Arcadia, which is the setting of The Outer Worlds 2. This is an isolated solar system with plenty of natural resources that is run by an authoritarian faction called The Protectorate. Arcadia is in trouble due to the appearance of space-time rifts, allegedly caused by skip drives (which allow interstellar travel). As an Earth Directorate agent, they'll have to find out what can be done to stop them. As you would expect, each faction has its own vision about what's happening and, most importantly, how to solve it.</p>
<p>The game even has a radio system, another nod to Fallout: New Vegas. There are three radio stations to tune into, each belonging to one of the major factions. Obsidian also said that the radio will also respond to what the player is doing, increasing the feeling of reactivity to the player's actions. Lastly, third-person view is fully featured this time around for those who don't love first-person view.</p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will be released on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. As usual for Microsoft-owned companies, the game will be available on day one via Game Pass for active subscribers.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a> is no longer without end. Developers Amplitude and publishers Hooded Horse have announced that the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game will release into early access on 7th August 2025. </p><!--more-->
<p>As you hopefully learned from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2-is-everything-i-love-about-2014s-best-4x-but-on-a-map-thats-constantly-changing">my hands-on earlier this year</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2's key differentiating factor is that it takes place on a procedurally generated waterworld that gradually dries out as you grow your civ. The water pulls back at intervals to reveal new tiles. This is helpful when the tiles harbour precious resources, and less helpful when the tiles form a causeway to your awful shithead neighbours. Shoo shoo!</p>
<p>Leaky ocean floor aside, the sequel also introduces a cleaner turn-based combat system in place of the original game's divisive method of having units move automatically based on initiative, after you'd given them orders. Beyond that, the broad strokes are as in Endless Legend 1. You plump and fortify your cities while training up hero characters with RPG-style skilltrees. There are NPC villages to befriend or beat into submission; adding their units to your construction options is part of how you'll tailor your civ to overcome your dastardly neighbours. And there are terse yet colourful quests that dig into your faction's backstory.</p>
<p>The game will offer five major factions, according to the latest press release. We currently know about three: the Kin of Sheredyn, aka Greco-Roman wall-builders, the Necrophage, aka ravenous bastard insects, and the Aspect, aka manipulative and insidious coral people. If I were a betting man, or alternatively a person capable of recognising familiar iconography on key art, I'd say Amplitude are also bringing back the Cultists from the first game. Their signature quirk was that they could only found one, gigantic city and were reliant on brain-washing NPC villages to extend their reach.</p>
<p> When they announced the game, Amplitude promised us six factions by the end of early access. Perhaps the Necrophage cannibalised one of other civs? Perhaps they're struggling for development resources? I guess I should do a journalism and ask. Amplitude bought their independence back from Sega last year - here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legends-how-amplitude-bought-their-independence-back-from-sega">my interview with CEO Romain de Waubert de Genlis</a> about how that happened. Since then they've scrabbled together <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amplitude-studios-raises-investment-griffin-gaming-partners-1236227964/">$13.5 million in funding</a>, which isn't Ubisoft money, but not to be sneezed at. I try not to sneeze at money, regardless of quantity.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Movement in each stage is controlled entirely by attacks, so players don’t need to reach a specific destination, just survive the onslaught. The more keys you press, the more devastating your attacks will become – and if keyboards aren’t for you, controllers work just as well, plus further accessibility options.</p><!-- AD: content -->

We look forward to sharing even more information in due time. &nbsp;</p><p>Persona 4 has spawned numerous spin-off works, including TV anime, Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and Persona 4: Dancing All Night, and is a special title that has been a part of Atlus for many years and holds a personal place in my heart. We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/baby-steps-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-preview-a-promising-first-stride.1212645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/baby-steps-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of the demo’s debut on Steam Next Fest, we got the opportunity to play the first chapter of the upcoming game developed by Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch (<em>Ape Out</em>), Bennett Foddy (<em>Getting Over It</em>), and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pepper-grinder-review" rel="nofollow">Devolver Digital</a>, <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with Bennett Foddy in particular, you're getting what you expect: a game that makes movement difficult in service of creating frustrating platforming, that eventually pays off once you finally get everything just right. What excited me most about this demo, though, were the things I didn’t expect: presentation in line with much larger studios, and a game that delivers on humor better than other games in years.</p>

<h2>One Small Step for Man</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em> in particular reminds me a lot of <em>QWOP</em>, Foddy’s breakout browser game. In <em>QWOP</em>, you played as a track star for whom running is, surprisingly, quite difficult. This time, using a controller in place of <em>QWOP</em>'s signature keyboard controls, even the most basic steps are a bit of a struggle. The level design is expertly paced around this struggle, though. Right when I started getting the hang of movement, a new ledge or set of steps came to throw me off my game.</p>

<p>This sort of movement has become a staple of any game with his name on it, and <em>Baby Steps</em> is no different. What is different, though, is the scale.</p>

<p><em>Baby Steps</em> looks great and runs smoothly, even in a very expansive world. Compared to the usual style of Foddian games, which steered more towards the minimalist side, <em>Baby Steps </em>feels like a premium, large-scale experience that spared no expense. I'm quite excited to see what locales show themselves next, as there are more varied locales shown in trailers than what I saw in my short slice of gameplay.</p>

<h2>One Giant Leap</h2>



<p>The most notable thing about <em>Baby Steps </em>wasn’t the Foddian locomotion system or presentation, though: it was the humor. Being a funny video game is no easy feat, but the team behind <em>Baby Steps</em> is delivering in spades.</p>

<p>The protagonist of the game, Nate, is perhaps the most pathetic man I’ve ever met, real or fictional. After he’s teleported by a mysterious power to a large mountain, he avoids human contact at all costs.</p>

<p>At one point in the demo, a fellow traveller remarks that he could probably use a map. Finally! A way to get some direction, and really get a grip on where exactly he is.</p>

<p>Nope. Nate says he’s actually fine without it, all in the name of avoiding any additional human conversation or contact. Barring a big shift in him, it feels like Nate will be actively working against the player at every step of the way.</p>

<p>In any game, or any story for that matter, there’s always some kind of force working against the protagonist. This feels like a rare time in games where a protagonist is working against themselves. Beyond creating a lot of funny scenes and situations, I’m excited to see where this game goes narratively, both for Nate and the mysterious world surrounding him, something I didn’t expect going in.</p>

<h2><em>Baby Steps</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>



<p><em>Baby Steps</em>, like most Foddian games, will almost certainly find an audience on streams. Foddy’s games like <em>Getting Over It</em>, and Foddy-inspired ones like <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-jump-king-takes-frustration-platforming-to-new-heights" rel="nofollow"><em>Jump King</em></a> and <em>Only Up</em>, were sensations on the platform, and I imagine this game will be no exception.</p>

<p>However, this slice of the game convinced me that this might be the best Foddy game from a player perspective yet. From the increased production value to the sharp wit, there is a lot here that justifies playing it yourself. Whether you’ve been closely following the creator since <em>QWOP</em> or this is your first exposure, this is a game that is poised to be a joy to play. Even if you play it and find it isn’t your thing, even if you play <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9" rel="nofollow">games with similar ideas </a>this year, I promise that you won’t play anything else quite like <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p>

While the Xbox event wasn’t full of big first-party reveals, we saw plenty of neat-looking games that showed the breadth and depth of the acquisition-spree and Game Pass supported Xbox bench, ranging from Double Fine’s next game to the reveal of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. </p><p>The hour-long showcase followed by a deep-dive into <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">which will be Microsoft’s first $80 game</a></span>) also included plenty of surprises from outside the world of Xbox. <em>Persona 4</em> is getting a remake, though Atlus barely showed anything from it. And a personal favorite indie platformer of mine, <em>Planet of Lana</em>, is getting a beautiful-looking sequel. Plus <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is finally coming to Xbox. It only took nearly six years and Square Enix hemorrhaging money to make that happen. Plus Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer capped everything off with a fun tease for what certainly sounds like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">remaster of<em> Halo: Combat Evolved</em></a></span>. </p></div></div><div><p>Obsidian Entertainment’s sci-fi shooter RPG got a new story trailer showing its bigger scope and grander stakes. The new launch date positions it as Microsoft’s big non-<em>Call of Duty </em>game this fall, though it will also be day-and-date on PS5. </p></div><div><p> More guns, more quips, and a bigger, bolder-looking sci-fi playground to mess around in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High on Life 2</em></a></span><em> </em>brings the comedic,<em> Rick and Morty</em>-esque alien romp to Xbox in the near future (sans Justin Roiland this time). </p></div><div><p><em>A Plague Tale</em> is getting mythical. The cinematic stealth adventure series is getting a prequel that looks a bit more action-focused and will dive into the smuggler Sophia’s past as she embarks on a quest on the Minotaur’s Island. <em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</em> is set to arrive in 2026. </p></div><div><p> Everything’s an Xbox, but this PC gaming portable is REALLY an Xbox. That was Microsoft’s messaging around its reveal of the Xbox ROG Ally and Ally X, the platform’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">new plunge yet into the world of high-end portable gaming</a></span>. There’s no price or release date yet, but Microsoft is hyping it up as its latest hardware launch in partnership with Asus and promising a seamless console to PC to handheld experience across the Xbox ecosystem. </p></div><div><p> What if The Witcher was more action game than RPG and led by a vampire that could walk up walls and do other cool stuff at night? <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em> is from Rebel Wolves,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blood-dawnwalker-trailer-rpg-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-1851739294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blood-dawnwalker-trailer-rpg-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2077-1851739294"> a studio led by some ex-CD Projekt Red devs that’s creating a new fantasy sandbox</a></span>. It looks a bit dark, like literally I had trouble seeing some of the stuff in the trailer, but the vibes are perfect. </p></div><div><p> Sluggerfly and Headup Games are working together on a sequel to the iconic side-scrolling platformer that looks like its cooking up all sorts of new ways to kill and torment players. It’s scheduled to release in 2026. </p></div><div><p> The latest look at <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372">announced earlier this year</a></span>, included slick new combat mechanics and boss fights while also shedding more light on the swirl of mystery surrounding the fate of the franchise’s legendary Ryu Hayabusa and what that has to do with a near-future Tokyo taken over by evil demons. It’s landing right in that fall release sweet spot recently exited by <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. </p></div><div><p> Arriving September 4, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-locks-doors-breath-1851718447?_gl=1*13a075l*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc1NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-locks-doors-breath-1851718447?_gl=1*13a075l*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc1NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">the <em>Indiana Jones</em> expansion</a></span> explores the story behind the Nephilim Order and takes players to Italy’s capital, including a stealth mission set in The Vatican. It’ll seemingly be out day-and-date on PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox and PC. I hope you get to punch more Nazis. </p></div><div><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em> is a fantastical third-person action game about taking out bosses using very <em>Souls</em>-looking combat. How does the Japanese studio find the time between all of its other <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-game-freak-switch-2-upgrade-fee-kalos-1851782651?_gl=1*jfcnyk*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc4MyRqMzMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-game-freak-switch-2-upgrade-fee-kalos-1851782651?_gl=1*jfcnyk*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk0MTIzMzQkbzI4NCRnMSR0MTc0OTQxMzc4MyRqMzMkbDAkaDA."><em>Pokémon</em> sequels and spin-offs</a></span>? Beast of Reincarnation puts you in the shoes of cursed outcast Emma as she battles giant monsters in post-apocalyptic Japan. I’m <em>Souls</em>-ed out but maybe this one will have the juice, or actually turn out to be more of a classic arcade action game than a FromSoftware-inspired dodge-fest. </p></div><div><p><em>Clockwork Revolution</em> is a <em>BioShock</em>-looking immersive action-RPG where everyone is having fun with their cockney accents. I was hoping for a release window but it seems to be shaping up nicely. The core mechanic is the power to manipulate time to fight enemies or solve puzzles by visually altering the environment. Players will also have an arsenal of gadgets, weapons, and a companion steampunk drones called Prentice.</p></div><div><p> The <em>Honey, I Shrunk The Kids</em>-style survival sim is getting what looks like a bigger, more polished sequel Grounded 2 is coming to Xbox and PC via Early Access on July 29 with new systems, bugs, and stories to tell. How is Obsidian releasing three games this year? Well for this one it’s getting help from <em>Deus Ex</em> maker Eidos-Montréal. </p></div><div><p>Bloober Team is wasting no time doubling-down on the third-person action survival horror genre. Following its dutiful remake of Silent Hill 2, <em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>arrives just one year later. Players have to travel through time to save humanity from crippling horrors of the past. It looks incredibly eerie as long as it can sport polished gameplay to match. </p></div><div><p><em>The Elder Scrolls Online: Seasons of the Worm Cult Part 1 </em>and update 46 go live on June 18. While that bit continues story quests from the game’s first year a decade ago, <em>ESO</em> is also getting it’s first world altering in-game event in October. </p></div><div><p>The cinematic action puzzle game promises to make players utilize solutions based in real-world science to survive after crash landing on a giant rock of ice. There will be platforming and stealth as players uncover the mystery haunting the frosty planet of Persephone.</p></div><div><p>Become an interior decorator who also hunt ghosts in this cozy sim where you can use a vacuum gun to suck up books or magically arrange them perfectly back on the shelf. </p></div><div><p> Heavenly Spear brings the Japanese Pantheon to the real-time strategy game in the fall. In addition to 12 new gods with unique powers there will be a new 12-mission campaign as well.</p></div><div><p> MUDANG could be all Unreal Engine 5 flash and no tactical gameplay substance, but it seems like it at least has a shot of filing the stealth takedown void left by Splinter Cell. Intriguingly, you play as a bunch of different characters ranging from a as a North Korean special forces operative to a K-pop idol.</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Planet of Lana </em>was excellent, and had some of the best visual flourishes of any 2D cinematic action game, but it was easy to underrate it as just “another good one of those,” so it’s rad to see <em>Planet of Lana 2</em> is happening and only a year away.</p></div><div><p> “Gone Fission” is <em>Fallout 76</em>'s latest life sim update adding all sorts of fishing rods to customize and fish heads to collect as players in the Wasteland continue to thrive years after the shooter MMO’s rocky launch. It’s live across all platforms starting today.</p></div><div><p><em>Solo Leveling</em> is a “global phenomenon” based on a “hit webtoon.” If you, like me, were also unaware of that, just know that <em>Arise Overdrive</em> is an anime action-RPG you can play with friends. It’s coming to PC in 2025 and Xbox in 2026. </p></div><div><p>No, it’s not<em> Palword</em>, but it sure does have that energy!<em> Aniimo</em> will arrive next year and looks like another survival game with fun creatures to befriend, except you can take control of them directly in this game instead of putting them into indentured servitude. </p></div><div><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> isn’t out until July 11 but there’s a demo you can start playing today.</p></div><div><p>Unlike <em>Spiritfarer</em>, the excellent narrative cozy sim about death, <em>At Fate’s End</em> is an action game where you solve emotional trauma with duels. It looks very tight. </p></div><div><p> Prepare for all your sweaty Xbox friends to chainsaw you in half when <em>Gears of War </em>multiplayer gets its pre-release betas stating June 13. A new trailer, meanwhile, showed off the extra enhancements going into the modern, multiplatform remaster. </p></div><div><p>The rumored remake of <em>Persona 4</em>, whose excellent <em>Golden</em> port only just arrived On Switch not too long ago, exists and is coming...eventually. Atlus teased fans with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-4-revival-trailer-teaser-remake-jrpg-xbox-ps5-1851784003">the briefest of glimpses</a></span> of at the PS2 game’s completely overhauled world and graphics. Considering how good the<em> Persona 3</em> remake was, I have high hopes. </p></div><div><p>Sea of Thieves season 17 arrives in August with an emphasis on explosives. Players can recruit new pirate allies to salvage for new weapons. It really feels like the game should be on <em>Switch 2</em> after it came to PS5 last year but Microsoft hasn’t announced a port yet. </p></div><div><p>Mark, Thula, Bulletproof, Atom Eve and more will square off in a 3v3 tag fighting game based on the hit comic series that’s also a gore-filled cartoon. The series first made its fighting game debut with Omni man’s cameo in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. <br></p></div><div><p>Fans have been waiting so long that some had given up all hope that Square Enix’s exclusivity deals with Sony for <em>Final Fantasy </em>would ever expire. But it turns out the biggest entries in the franchise in recent years will come to Microsoft’s platform after all starting with <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>which shadow dropped today.

It's called Keeper, and it puts you in the wobbly legs of a walking sapient lighthouse driven by a silly-looking bird. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The footage shows a goofy bird landing atop a lighthouse, which then sprouts spindly legs and begins trotting off across the continent with the bird seemingly helping or helming the operation. It's not clear just yet what the lighthouse is after, why or how it can walk, or what it's relationship with the bird is, but the world it's wandering is clearly a fantastical one in the dreamy vein of other Double Fine games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Strange as it seems, we've got high hopes for Keeper after Double Fine's past work. We gave Psychonauts 2 an 8/10, with our reviewer saying that its "weird and wonderfully written story is full of interesting, nuanced characters that I instantly fell in love with." and that "Double Fine has also done a great job of expanding this universe toward both grander and more intimate threats without losing the joyous childhood adventure vibes of the original."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper is out on October 17 for PlayStastion 5, Xbox, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">today's Xbox Games Showcase right here</a>, and keep up on the bevy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-reveals-from-ign-live-2025">new announcements all weekend at IGN Live here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

This specific scene was saved for the end of the trailer and shown alongside a brief tease of Treyarch's Zombies mode for Black Ops 7, so it is possible Activision is teasing Avalon for Warzone.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">However, fans shouldn't get their hopes up too soon. Black Ops 7 is revealed to be a co-op campaign, so it is possible the scene in question is just a section of the campaign used to show off four-player co-op. Additionally, known Call of Duty insider "The Ghost of Hope" <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1931779343421677956" rel="nofollow ">claims the Avalon map was scrapped</a> for battle royale and would be used for campaign and Outbreak Zombies mode for Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we'll likely learn more about Black Ops 7 and Warzone in the coming weeks, as Activision says more details will be revealed later this summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4 is currently live in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. The season features a crossover event with the Ballerina movie, which is part of the John Wick universe. Players can earn free cosmetics and unlock a new marksman rifle during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/#2">Ballerina event in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.</p>

            <p>Don't Nod - the studio behind the likes of Jusant, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> 1 and 2, and Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - has revealed its next game.</p>
<p>It's known as Aphelion, and, in a change for the studio, will be Don't Nod's first human story in space. The developer promises a "powerful" experience on the game's 2026 release, across Xbox Series X/S, Steam, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>"Set in a near-future where Earth is on the brink of collapse, Aphelion is an emotional journey to the edge of our Solar System to survey a planet that may be humanity's last hope," reads the official blurb. "As astronaut Ariane Montclair, crash landed on the newly discovered Persephone, players must brave harsh landscapes, master survival tools, and navigate reality-bending phenomena on a desperate mission to reunite with her wounded partner, Thomas Cross." You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>The game is being developed in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), which will help ground Aphelion and its depiction of space exploration in "real scientific knowledge and humanistic values", Don't Nod has said.</p>
<p>"For fifty years, ESA has combined rigorous space science with the boundless imagination of science fiction to explore solutions to our planet's greatest challenges. Aphelion captures that spirit - where research meets imaginative vision - to inspire the next generation to carry Europe's space ambition into the future," said Nadia Lüders, ESA Partnership &amp; Brand Licensing Officer.</p>

            <p>
An extended look at Clockwork Revolution was shown at today's Xbox Games Showcase, which is "coming in due time".
</p>
<p>
The steampunk RPG shooter has already drawn comparison to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> games and in this new gameplay trailer we see plenty of gadgets and time-bending powers.
</p>
<p>
There's also a good look at its clockwork steampunk aesthetic, with plenty of humour too. Characters include "the pissed-off doll" and "the knob", among others.

<p>
The game is being developed by inXile Entertainment, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-saints-row-developers-join-clockwork-revolution-development">help from former Volition developers under the studio name Shapeshifter Games</a>. Volition - known for the Saints Row series - was closed in 2023 due to the poor performance of its most recent game.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date yet for Clockwork Revolution, though it'll be out on Game Pass from day one. It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S.

Shadow dropped during today’s Xbox Games Showcase, players will be able to experience <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview"><em>FFXVI</em>’s slick-ass kaiju monster battles</a>, incredible voice acting, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">ho-hum story</a> (because, hey, you can’t expect Square Enix to be perfect at everything). In addition to the base game, players will also get access to <em>FFXVI</em>’s two story DLCs <em>The Rising Tide</em> and <em>Echoes of the Fallen</em> which adds more story and a new Eikon (the game’s version of summons) Leviathan.</p><p>But that’s not all as the partnership between Xbox and Square Enix continues apace. Last year, Xbox brought the critically acclaimed MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> to the system. Later it was rumored, due to Square Enix’s stated desire to expand their games beyond the PlayStation ecosystem, that it would bring the <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> remake project to Xbox as well. That rumor has been proven true. The absurdly titled <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em>, which is the first entry in the <em>FF7</em> reimagination project combined with the Yuffie-centric DLC, is coming to Xbox this winter.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-steampunk-rpg-from-the-makers">first announced</a> at this same Xbox Games Showcase back in 2023, but today’s presentation offered a much deeper look at what we can expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In Clockwork Revolution, players take on the role of a customized character named Morgan Vanette, who lives in a seemingly steampunk-inspired alternate history of 1895, in the city of Avalon in a neighborhood called The Tangle. Part of a gang known as the Rotten Row Hooligans, Morgan navigates a world populated both by people and clockwork individuals, and some that seem halfway between the two.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Gameplay shows off plenty of sneaking and combat, as well as some extensive customization tools for both character visuals and weapons. But the most intriguing gameplay shows off special time powers that let Morgan do things like rewind time, rebuild destroyed structures, slow down enemy bullets, and in a larger sense, rewrite the flow of history.</p><p>There’s no word yet on when we can expect Clockwork Revolution to arrive, but the game is targeting a launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With its July arrival almost upon us, Activision has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> demo, but it's a pre-order exclusive, making it very much the opposite of 'try before you buy'.
</p>
<p>
As we learned previously, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a ground-up remake of the beloved skating games, and brings a range of "modern upgrades" - including "new skaters, gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack", alongside new parks (a water park, pinball table, and movie studio are confirmed), plus cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer includes the new HAWK mode, which sees players dropping letters in hard-to-find spots then racing to find as many as they can within the time limit. There's also the sandbox-y Free Skate mode, plus a range of different activities within the Competitive playlist: Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, and Graffiti.

<p>
As for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's expanded playable roster, it now includes Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Zion Wright, Jamie Foy, Nora Vasconcellos, Margielyn Didal, Yuto Horigome, Zion Wright, Aurélien Giraud, and Andy Anderson. Additionally, there's an appearance from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Michelangelo, who arrives as an unlockable "secret" skater.
</p>
<p>
Actvision has also confirmed the return of Create-A-Skater, alongside an upgraded version Create-A-Park, which introduces new props - including speed boost pads and musical notes - and the ability to add custom goals. Players fond of documenting their skating highlights can also make use of a new photo mode.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>, PC, and Game Pass when it launches on 11th July.
</p>
<p>
As for that demo, it's out today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and features the Foundry and College parks, skaters Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, plus a limited selection of songs. However, you'll need to pre-order the full game in order to access it.

		<p>The Sunday of not-E3 is renowned as Microsoft’s time to shine. It’s fair to say that recent years haven’t quite set hearts racing, no matter how good Xbox output like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed have been, so it’s a welcome surprise to find that Xbox haven’t just rolled out a few smart-looking trailers, with the earth-shattering announcement that they’re set to release the very first Xbox handheld. It’s not even just one, with the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X providing two different tiers of Xbox handheld. This is a great day for Xbox gamers.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The quickest among you will note that the ROG Ally is a thing that already exists. ROG’s Ally, and it’s more powerful follow-up the Ally X, are PC handhelds that have spent the last few years competing with Valve’s Steam Deck for portable PC gamers’ hearts. There’s a very strong argument to say that they’re the better option, though they’ve been hamstrung by Microsoft’s own Windows platform which was never made specifically for a handheld format. </p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are the best of both worlds, the partnership between the two companies giving you access to your entire Xbox library as well as opening up the world of PC gaming to you as well, including all of the PC based stores like Steam and the Epic Game Store. </p>
<p>The Xbox Ally and Ally X have had some obvious physical changes made to them over ROGs older versions of the Ally, most noticeably in the extended, and presumably far more ergonomic hand grips. The Steam Deck’s comfort levels were the last bastion of defence that Steam Deck owners had over Ally owners, and we can’t wait to see if the Xbox Ally and Ally X trounce them, becoming the most comfortable PC handheld out there. </p>


<p>They’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, alongside 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor as well as a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. They’re both going to be serious gaming machines – the original Ally has been a fantastic option, with a less powerful chipset, so we can’t wait to see how the new pair will perform. </p>
<p>Both have 7″ 1080p full HD screens, with a 120Hz refresh rate, and Freesync Premium onboard, which should mean everything will look super smooth and bright.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ambrosia Sky Preview - Fighting Against Fungus]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus.1212537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's just something so satisfying about cleaning up a mess -- provided it's in a video game. Real-life messes are no fun, but for some reason, power-washing that house is just too satisfying. The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;provides that same satisfaction, but with a deadly twist.</p>

<p>Indeed, usually nothing is fighting back against you as you clean, but in&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a deadly fungus seeks you out. A so-called first-person, immersive "clean 'em up" from developer Soft Rains,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky's&nbsp;</em>fungal foe is truly terrifying.</p>



<h2>It's Time for Cleanup&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let's set the stage. It's far into the future and you're a "Scarab," essentially an undertaker that helps the deceased pass on. She's also something of a space "disaster specialist," armed with tools to clean up the contamination.</p>

<p>We begin the demo in a space station. The aim is to find a body and help it pass on, but this fungus is everywhere. Working our way through the space station, going past deadly fungus some of it is electric, and other variants literally&nbsp;<em>seek you out</em>.</p>



<p>This is where&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky&nbsp;</em>really impressed me. This fungus is forming around you quickly, and it's so fast that you become surrounded. Just seeing this amalgamation build up around you is an impressive technical feat.</p>

<p>Not only that, it's how you can clean up this fungus that is equally impressive. Soft Rains has developed a technology called "Quantized Impact Field." It's a mouthful, but hey, it works quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fungus are voxels, but the tech hides it very well. Cleaning the fungus with various sprays at your disposal break it down; in other words, volumetric cleaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Spray it All Away</h2>

<p>The sprayer you have is a cool tool. Like I said, cleaning is satisfying, and so is spraying down the fungus and having it crumble away. There are various sprays, like the basic, which is great for cleaning, but also others like fire and electric.</p>

<p>Fire can spread, by the way, and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Electric spray, on the other hand, allows players to activate doors without a direct line to power. Shoot spray at the top of the door and keep spraying until it hits an active power source, and there you go, it's on!</p>

<p>You can also change the nozzle, so the spray can go straight, vertical, or horizontal. In one segment, the gravity in the space station is turned off. Because of that, the spray no longer arcs due to gravity and allows you to clean all the more effectively.</p>



<h2><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's also worth nothing, the developers aren't necessarily aiming for a highly detailed art style, but the Quantized Impact Field makes up for a lot of it. Combined with excellent use of lighting,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;is a promising game.</p>

<p>While it'll likely take several more years to develop, a demo is available today on Steam, so if cleaning up some deadly shrooms tickles your fancy, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3716830/Ambrosia_Sky_Demo/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>!</p>

The Lighthouse discovers that its bright beam of light is able to affect the flora and fauna, and even seems to ward off the withering tendrils spreading throughout the world around it. </p><p>Meanwhile the bird proves to be a useful and dextrous ally, able to interact with strange and ancient mechanisms. Together, these two unlikely friends set off together on an epic adventure, an odyssey of mystifying metamorphosis, and a journey that will take them into realms beyond understanding. </p></blockquote></div><p>The art in the trailer is absolutely gorgeous, and it looks like the world will be a beautiful one to explore. The game will be a “story told without words” and is a “strange, otherworldly tale,” according to the post. I’m looking forward to it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
