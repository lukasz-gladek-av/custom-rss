            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> marked the official confirmation of something that felt like it would never happen just a short few years ago, with Halo officially coming to PlayStation. Following that announcement, GameStop, the retailer that was initially known for selling physical video games that's now more known for turning into a glorified Pop Funko and merch store called the 'Console Wars' over. Of all entities, the White House, which would normally have more important things to post about, responded with an AI-generated image of President Trump in Spartan armor with the caption "<em>Power to the players</em>."</p>



<p>GameStop's original post comes with a long and drawn-out declaration about the console wars being over, calling them <em>"petty</em>," which they definitely are, and also claiming that they originated with the release of the original Xbox and Halo: Combat Evolved with it. </p>



<p>A bit of a history lesson here for GameStop: console wars or, more accurately, players needlessly siding with one console manufacturer over another based on things like exclusive games you might prefer over the other and real-life factors like most parents being unwilling and/or unable to afford buying their kids consoles from every manufacturer, began long before the days of Xbox vs. PlayStation with Nintendo vs. SEGA.</p>



<p>Sure, Console Wars have always been more than a bit idiotic, but at least get the details of it right if you're going to go through the effort of making a big song-and-dance over it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking of getting the details right, unspurisingly, the AI that someone at the White House used to generate the image of Trump in Master Chief's armor holding an energy sword and saluting the American Flag on the White House lawn, did not get the details right. Specifically the key detail of the fact that the American flag should have 50 stars on it, one for each state. Instead, the AI-generated image only has 40 stars on the flag. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>By now, we're used to AI-generated images getting details wrong, and we've also become used to The White House using AI-generated images to display the President in all manner of ways, including ones that have caught a fair deal of flak, like the image that showed Trump as the Pope following the death of Pope Francis.</p>



<p>But it feels telling that important details like getting the right number of stars on the American flag in a post coming from the official White House account are overlooked in an attempt to garner some kind of cultural clout. Like how the caption "<em>Power to the Players</em>" overlooks the fact that tariffs instituted by the current administration have been a direct factor in the cost of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">gaming hardware going up in the United States and worldwide</a>. </p>



<p>Or how, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411">in 2019, Trump pointed to video games as "<em>the glorification of violence in our society</em>,"</a> and pointed to violence in games as a reason for America's mass shooting problems. Never mind the fact that several studies have never been able to prove any links between mass shootings and violence in video games, or the fact that games like Halo and Call of Duty are available everywhere in the world, and only in the United States do these mass shooting issues persist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5Rj8M6FRYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Shacknews</a> alongside a few other colleagues to discuss the making of Borderlands 4, the studio's latest game, which was released on September 12.</p>



<p>The video runs for 73 minutes, and right toward the end, Pitchford goes into exactly what is needed to create such a big videogame like Borderlands 4. Interestingly, he then adds that the gaming industry as a whole is just getting started and 'figuring out' videogames, which haven't yet received their 'Citizen Kane' moment yet.</p>



<p><em>To make a game like Borderlands 4 takes a big investment. It's a massive, massive game. Hundreds and hundreds of people for years. And that's very expensive. The budgets of our big video games now are larger than the budgets of blockbuster movies. You can't easily make that decision to commit those kinds of resources towards a thing, whether you're the person who has the cash or you're any individual on that team, to decide to commit that portion of your life to that endeavor. </em></p>



<p><em>It can only happen if everybody in that loop believes that what is being imagined has more value to exist in the world than what it takes to create it, which means you both need the idea of what it takes to create it, the belief in what it takes to create it, and a sense of what it might be worth if it was created. And everybody has to have that understanding, or it just doesn't work. And I love that I'm in it and I love that we're just getting started. When I say we, I'm talking about the entire industry. Like, we haven't even had our Citizen Kane yet, let alone, you know, Jurassic Park or Star Wars. We're just figuring this out. But it's fun.</em></p>



<p>Cinephiles already know that Pitchford is referencing the film directed by Orson Welles. Released in 1941, it is considered the first true masterpiece in cinema, not to mention one of the best movies ever made to this day. </p>



<p>While Pitchford may have a point in that gaming is not yet as developed as other entertainment media, it has been 54 years since the release of the first commercial game (Computer Space), and many gamers would agree that the medium has already provided multiple 'Citizen Kanes' to date. Its evolution is arguably even faster than cinema's, and nowadays, movie and TV companies are fighting to get the rights to adapt gaming franchises way more than vice versa. </p>



<p>It may not be as controversial a statement as <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some Borderlands 4 claims made by the Gearbox founder</a>, but it's still bound to get gamers talking.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/painkiller-review-atrophied-angel</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/painkiller-review-atrophied-angel.1336177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My time machine to return to 2012 must have worked. A co-op centric shooter reboot of <em>Painkiller</em>, a 2004 title that originally didn’t feature co-op centric gameplay, looking to emulate the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/10-years-of-left-4-dead-hunters-and-boomers-and-smokers-oh-my" rel="nofollow"><em>Left 4 Dead</em></a>? There’s still work to be done. I need to hoard some <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive" rel="nofollow"><em>Counter-Strike</em></a> skins and make sure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinion/why-microsoft-looking-sonys-dinner-sales-floor" rel="nofollow">Xbox doesn’t shoot itself in the foot</a> to create a substantially healthier console war atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is the latest title from Polish developers Anshar Studios, a studio typically involved in providing assistance, most notably for teams like Bloober (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill 2</a>, Layers of Fear), and Larian (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow">Baldur’s Gate III</a>). Other than that, they’ve also dabbled in the likes of CRPGs with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gamedec" rel="nofollow">Gamedec</a>, and experimented with VR in the form of Detached and Telefrag. It’s clear they’ve got charisma and the variance to match it.</p>

<p>You play as one of four individuals, tasked by Metatron, the Voice of God, to prevent Azazel’s invasion of Earth by way of an endless demon horde. These characters are composed of Ink, a no-nonsense female mercenary type, Roch, a brutish individual displaying Dwarfish personality traits, Void, a strangely geeky individual who seems to play the straight man, and Sol, a devilish minx type who cosplays as a nun.</p>



<p>Judging from the eye test, <em>Painkiller </em>doesn’t <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/painkiller-preview-classic-fps-back-from-purgatory" rel="nofollow">leave a lot to hope for</a>. Similar to the gothic environments on display, this cold, almost cynical portrayal of Hell and how you interact with it immediately leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. With that said, it’s not like <em>Painkiller</em>’s name is being inexplicably ripped away from its legacy, a la the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prey-review-dont-fear-reaper" rel="nofollow"><em>Prey</em> </a>reboot, and indeed, an outcome similar to <em>Prey WAS </em>possible.</p>

<p>For example, the weapons that made the original game famous have returned and are modernized, like the titular “Painkiller” and electro-shuriken shooter, and for the most part, the weapons feel great. Standard additions such as the shotgun and rocket launcher have the feedback to provide catharsis, although the aforementioned electro-shuriken shooter fails to have the same oomph as times past. This may be due to the enemy variety also, as all of them are squishy vessels for ultra-gibbing and shiny red gore, pressed under the modern demand for video games, so the lack of a visible body count hurts proceedings.</p>

<p>Also, no skeleton warriors. Boo!</p>



<p>All 4 characters have a preset perk, their only defining factor of difference in gameplay styles, and all of them are a borderline for co-op synergy. With that said, synergy is saved for the returning tarot card system, which is executed wonderfully in the core gameplay loop. There are 1 or 2 outliers that are able to single-handedly win you a run, with bots or otherwise, but the ones that offer baseline buffs tend to be felt in actual gameplay.</p>

<p>There’s also a scoring system attached to general proceedings, one which is largely negligible in terms of what it rewards, that being simple kills. Sure, there are minuscule bonuses attached when you kill an enemy with a certain element, but the rewards for it are, frankly, invisible. You never really feel like you get more gold or XP after a match, whether you score 3 million points or 30 million, which is disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Levels themselves are largely linear, sprinkled with gold, small amounts of team banter, and arena standoffs. With the latter, you’ll either have to transport a barrel-shaped object from one area to the next, or survive against 3 enemy waves – and it’ll always be 3 enemy waves. Respectively, they’re a test of brain and brawn, and for Painkiller itself, a showcase of how not to transplant this type of gameplay into a co-op core.</p>



<p>The problem here is pace. <em>Painkiller </em>wants to host&nbsp;a lot of free-running flow in its mechanics and level design, with slides, dashes, and grappling available, in very strict, suffocating doses. In reality, the rugged and otherwise decrepit portrayal of the visual design and arenas leads to an attainable flow not being possible. You’ll more than likely slide for a second before a bump or outcropping of rocks stops you dead.</p>

<p>Due to a completely arbitrary stamina system attached to the movement mechanics, and the generally low base speed of your characters, teamwork is more forced than generated naturally. It’s really easy to get swarmed, and the character perks and systems aren’t there to substantiate a system that doesn't just result in corner camping. You’ll almost always be a squishy, quippy – unbearingly quippy – hunk of meat with bullets coming out of it.</p>

<p>The writing is also another bag of worms. Before you’ve even faced your first demon, characters will be drenching every line with such sour, grotesque flavors of ironic detestability, as if Purgatory is only showing Joss Whedon films. There’s no variety in the dialogue either, so each of the 9 levels present in the base game will present you with the exact same exposition, and the exact same call-outs, and the exact same insufferable jokes.</p>



<p>There is absolutely no reason for this. No one was asking Daniel Garner in the original <em>Painkiller </em>to punctuate his later adventures with references to <em>Deuce Bigalow</em>, and what exactly do these one-note personalities add to proceedings? Why does Void “act” like a charming robot, despite being some nebulous, unknown vessel? If it’s due to the lack of modern context, why does everyone have a modern lexicon?</p>

<p>It sounds nitpicky, but when you have to hear the same thing every single run, with no variance in the arenas, their spawns, their dialogue, or otherwise, it grows into this incessant banter-y beast. It’s not funny hearing Sol’s dominatrix quips for the 100th time; it’s not funny hearing Azazel act like Barney from <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>. There is no character growth here, just pointless jokes while history and context are all buried behind a completely codex of flavorless history, which feels antithetical to what characters and their personalities generate.</p>

<p>As harsh as it is to say, this co-op function is the worst part of&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, which is why you should focus on yourself. Play with bots, create your own rampage, and find yourself in a much better position than worrying about your teammates. The bot AI is an over-performer in terms of the issues it faces, and it seems Anshar is aware of any potential issues, which is why it'll teleport to any location almost on demand.</p>



<h2><em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it comes down to it, Painkiller is a shooter set in Hell, stylistically and substantially so. But when compared to the competition, games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-2016" rel="nofollow"><em>DOOM</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/first-person-spotlight-quake" rel="nofollow"><em>Quake</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bpm-bullets-per-minute-review" rel="nofollow">BPM: Bullets Per Minute</a></em>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dread-templar" rel="nofollow">Dread Templar</a></em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metal-hellsinger" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal: Hellsinger</em></a>, <em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ultrakill" rel="nofollow"><em>Ultrakill</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warstride-challenges" rel="nofollow">Warstride Challenges</a></em>, <em>Killing Floor</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/prodeus" rel="nofollow"><em>Prodeus</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>Dusk</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/devil-daggers-review-giving-devil-its-due" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil Daggers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/first-person-saturday-blood" rel="nofollow"><em>Blood</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/coverage-club-nightmare-reaper-is-brutal-callback-to-fps-golden-age" rel="nofollow"><em>Nightmare Reaper</em></a>, and even&nbsp;<em>Clive Barker's Jericho</em>? This is a graveyard of creativity by comparison, spawned from the corpse of a world that flourished before.</p>

<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      <div><p>The Combined Army, under the command of the alien AI, the Evolved Intelligence, has recruited the hero Achilles from humanity's AI, Aleph, to lead a combined force of aliens and enhanced humans under the banner of the Next Wave. But Achilles hasn't abandoned humanity, but has changed sides to save it. In this article, we check out the first release for <em>Infinity's</em> newest sectorial, the Next Wave Action Pack.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in the current edition of&nbsp;<em>Infinity, N5</em>.</p>




<h2>Humanity Evolved</h2>

<p>The Evolved Intelligence is an alien AI that has destroyed and assimilated multiple worlds and races to its cause. Its forces are known as the Combined Army, specially selected races and units that serve in specific roles. We've previously looked at the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-morat-aggression-forces-guide" rel="nofollow">Morat Aggression Forces</a>, the mailed fist of the Combined Army. Now, the EI has unleashed its newest force, the Next Wave, a combined force of alien races and humans that have defected from the control of ALEPH, humanity's AI.</p>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Action Pack contains 10 miniatures that are exclusive to the Next Wave sectorial, so don't feature in the wider Combined Army faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3 Harbingers (2x Combi Rifle, 1x Hacker) - These are the Next Wave line infantry and can be upgraded to Paramedic, Lieutenant, or Comlink Specialist with the Combi-Rifle profile. They come with Dodge +3 as standard and Combat Instinct, which makes them difficult to catch off guard. The extra skills throughout the Next Wave profiles are what set them apart from the human line infantry in other forces.</li>
	<li>1 Contrabandolero (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit is designed to sneak with&nbsp;Hidden deployment, Infiltration with a bonus to the check, Stealth, Surprise Attack, Dodge +3, and Mimetism -3, and if that wasn't enough, can specialize&nbsp;as&nbsp;a Hacker, Minelaye,&nbsp;or Forward Observer.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Cliff-Jumper (Boarding Shotgun) - This unit, as the name would suggest, is a specialist parachutist who also comes with +1Burst to make their ranged weapons more effective.</li>
	<li>1 Ironside (HMG) - This heavy infantry unit&nbsp;is made up of humans&nbsp;melded with a technorganic device attached to their spine. Their&nbsp;Albedo equipment means that units targeting them with specialist abilities and equipment take a negative modifier, and their BS-3 skill means that they're more likely to win opposed shooting rolls.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>2x Raindancer (1x Red Fury, 1x Contender) - These are close combat specialists with Dodge +3 and +2 inches, Mimetism -6, and Stealth to help them close up. Despite being close combat focused, both of these profiles have soldi ranged weapons to use as they move up the field.</li>
	<li>1 Tekdraken Steeljaw (Boarding Pistol) - The Tekdrakens have 2 different types in Next Wave. The Steeljaw versions are the close combat specialists. They are fast with&nbsp;a 6-4 move, as you might expect from a cybernetically boosted dinosaur. You can also pay an extra point to give them a combi-rifle turret (and you should, because it looks awesome).</li>
	<li>Pandora (Viral Pistol) - This special character is a pitcher deployer, meaning she&nbsp;can fire a repeater token to extend her hacking area. She's also key here because she is a Fireteam Master, so she can join a Fireteam with the Tekdrakens to keep them in line.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=NGZopXU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=hCNzjr-I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Tekdraken is a literal TechRaptor!</figcaption></figure><p>From what we can tell, Next Wave is going to have a lot of focus on multiple small fire teams, with some solid infantry, lizard/dinosaur heavy-hitting units, and the special characters that made the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-operation-blackwind-guide" rel="nofollow">Steel Phalanx</a> awesome.</p>

<p>Releasing alongside the Next Wave Action Pack as part of the pre-order, is the Juggernaut, who, rather than standard TAG which are piloted armoured suits, is a technorganic giant cat with a rider. The juggernaut comes with an 8-2 move and a multi-HMG with -1 to the opponent's saving throw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The special pre-order bonus for Next Wave is the Glyph Warcor, an alien journalist with the standard Dodge +3 that the Next Wave infantry has. They can have either sixth sense, which lets them respond to attacks outside of their normal arc, or the 360-degree visor, which lets them shoot outside of their normal arc.</p>

<p>After that, we expect the rest of the faction to fill out with a release a month, along the same lines as previous factions, with their named characters, and more awesome alien fusion (and the other flavor of TechRaptor, I mean Tekdraken).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=GKFfQbAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-combined-army-next-wave-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=flnSQGda 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Infinity</em> Next Wave Juggernaut miniature is a break from standard TAGs, and features a mounted rider.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Next Wave Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The Next Wave looks awesome. The layered plates and reptilian texture on their armor make them look like the fusion of human and alien that they are. The fact that they have a literal TechRaptor is a bonus. They also stand out, and the wealth of abilities on top of their stats makes them seem like humanity evolved. Outside of the Action Pack, the Juggernaunt miniature is incredible, and I love that rather than go the standard TAG route, we've got a full mounted cavalry unit. I can't wait to see the named characters as they get introduced to the faction, and what other alien fusions come along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, the citizens of Lumiose City worry about the potential consequences of having wild monsters living alongside humans, with the monsters in designated Wild Zones. What if a powerful Pokémon escapes these fenced-in areas and wreaks havoc on the populace? That’s a perfectly valid fear, actually, because fans have become so scared of one of these zones that they’re warning other players not to go in there without a powerful water Pokémon on their team. I’m talking about Wild Zone 17, and its literal lion’s den full of Pyroars.</span></p> <p><span>This small area was once a simple park, and now that Lumiose City has made it a Wild Zone, untamed Pokémon roam it. The local Diggersby is making tunnels in its earth. Skarmory flies over the area. When you go there after the sun goes down, you might find a Lampent’s flame lighting up the night. Those are pretty manageable, however. What’s got players spooked is that an entire pride of Pyroar hangs out in the upper area. As best as I can tell after repeated trips to Wild Zone 17, the spawn is fixed to have one Alpha-sized male Pyroar and several regular-sized female ones. If even one of these fire-breathing lions sees you, the entire pack is going to pounce on you before you can even throw a Poké Ball. These felines seem to target the player’s trainer character almost exclusively, and after a few attacks, you’ll get knocked out and sent back to where the humans roam. They’re territorial, powerful, and can overwhelm you quickly. The experience of getting your shit rocked by these Pyroars has become such an infamous skill check while trying to complete the Pokédex that fans are posting their Ls online and turning Wild Zone 17 into a new meme like it’s the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>equivalent of the Shadow Realm.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">help <a href="https://t.co/Pdfy2MwVA1">pic.twitter.com/Pdfy2MwVA1</a></p> <p>— 🌷Thea🌷 (@Flak0ps) <a href="https://twitter.com/Flak0ps/status/1980669582181560365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">earth powering you <a href="https://t.co/YVqkVONy2r">pic.twitter.com/YVqkVONy2r</a></p> <p>— HT1 8️⃣▶️🍉 (@BrocTaeshi4ever) <a href="https://twitter.com/BrocTaeshi4ever/status/1981045295845900428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enter wild zone 17</p> <p>— Pyroar (@DittoImposter) <a href="https://twitter.com/DittoImposter/status/1980945005775565082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">wild zone 17 piss me the fuck off so i caught this guys whole pride. fuck you <a href="https://t.co/5v6wrK6TMW">pic.twitter.com/5v6wrK6TMW</a></p> <p>— Bubbly Mar 🏳️‍⚧️ 🦊 (@bubblymarmar) <a href="https://twitter.com/bubblymarmar/status/1982222363669209592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wild Zone 17 <a href="https://t.co/MNW5GgmYjt">pic.twitter.com/MNW5GgmYjt</a></p> <p>— TheKingVillager (@TheKingVillager) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKingVillager/status/1979612554650689668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey. hey come to wild zone 17. we promise we wont jump you dawg we got skarmory and chespin here its all cool we dont even know earth power <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyroar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pyroar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/0MxYw3LSto">pic.twitter.com/0MxYw3LSto</a></p> <p>— Art honse (@CrypticKelpie) <a href="https://twitter.com/CrypticKelpie/status/1980727429946830954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying to catch fucking Skarmory with the pack of lions trying mauling you</p> <p>— AlfLandonFan (@AlfLandonFan36) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlfLandonFan36/status/1979772143178297629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wild Zone 17 in Z-A has proven to me that a billion lions might actually win</p> <p>— Solosis (@Solosis0o0) <a href="https://twitter.com/Solosis0o0/status/1980999404564967499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">The Most Difficult parts of Pokémon:</p> <p>1.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-is-crimson-desert-this-fantasy-steampunk-open-world-isn%E2%80%99t-as-strange-as-you-may-think.1336135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been almost six years since Crimson Desert was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-official-reveal-trailer">first revealed to the world</a>. Across that period, developer Pearl Abyss has shown off a huge array of ideas, mechanics, and boss battles. It’s frequently been cited as something of an “everything game” – an open world adventure with sky islands, mechanical dragons, wrestling moves, interdimensional gateways, interacting elemental effects, and even a Spider-Man web swing. But the more that’s been revealed, the more there’s been the sense that Crimson Desert may be a lot of pieces in need of a whole. Finding that whole was my main objective when I visited Pearl Abyss’ studio in Seoul for this month’s IGN First. And while I can’t say I’ve found it yet, multiple hours of hands-on playtime has revealed a game that’s maybe not as strange as you’d expect. In fact, Crimson Desert feels pretty straightforward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss has crafted a reasonably traditional open world adventure, made up of multiple regions peppered with towns, outposts, and castles. There’s the usual collection of main and optional quests, plus classic distractions like fishing. You’d be forgiven for not realising this, though – Pearl Abyss has put almost all its promotional efforts into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-three-new-bosses-gameplay">showcasing boss fights</a>. Not only that, but Crimson Desert’s blend of traditional medieval fantasy with sci-fi and steampunk elements does make it seem like it’s being pulled in several directions at once. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’re on the ground and seeing how all these elements interact, though, it doesn’t feel quite so alien. The continent of Pywel is perhaps less like a typical Tolkien-esque fantasy world and more akin to Dungeons &amp; Dragons – a setting that, in recent years, was host to <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dungeons-dragons-baldurs-gate-descent-into-avernus-review-8-1200x900.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Mad Max-like vehicular chase through Hell</a>. Pearl Abyss’ design team explained that they wanted Pywel to reflect the variety of our reality, in which some countries feel much more futuristic than others, and note that some of the Pywel’s leaders may be more resistant to the advancement of technology than others – a conflict that’ll be explored through various faction quests. All this means the variety doesn’t feel artificial or there simply for the sake of being wild, even when you’re at the controls of a flying battle robot (which was, of course, designed by dwarven engineers.) </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The inclusion of these mechanised and steampunk elements grant Pearl Abyss the creative license to build quests that are a significant departure from anything we’d see in something like Skyrim. A major part of my hands-on time involved completing a quest for Marni, a scientific genius who cloned his own consciousness to create the AI-like entity, H.A.L.L. Naturally the results of such an experiment have gone very wrong, and Marni’s evil digital-magic twin has taken command of a flying fortress that’s terrorizing Pywel’s skies. Defeating H.A.L.L requires the use of a power core, which Marni reveals is hidden inside a “weapon” called Golden Star. And by “weapon”, he means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-golden-star-quest-gameplay">a giant mechanical dragon</a>. While they presumably have ballistic missiles in Pywel, what with the advanced engineering and all, <em>of course</em> the fantasy version of a nuke is flying Mechagodzilla. All that stands between me and this winged menace is… a fortress filled with angry battle robots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears that fortress assaults will be a significant recurring objective in Crimson Desert, considering that my hands-on time involved no fewer than three of them. I can see why Pearl Abyss was keen to show them off, as they are a showcase for some of the project’s strongest achievements. There’s a great sense of atmosphere, with a legion of men from either side battering the living hell out of each other, and you’re caught in the middle of it all. Fun mechanical wrinkles add texture; during one attack I was able to fire signalling arrows that were quickly followed by a bombardment of artillery, decimating enemy soldiers and reducing buildings to splinters. In another, I was able to circumnavigate the brutal melee entirely, sneaking into the castle through a crumbling wall and using the prison as a shortcut to the boss. And in my fight through the robot fortress, a backpack-mounted EMP device allowed me to fry the circuits of both the lumbering ground threats and the airborne bug-bots in one giant blast. There’s always something new to try, something to experiment with.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The variety of ideas doesn’t feel artificial or there simply for the sake of being wild, even when you’re at the controls of a flying battle robot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But as much as these fortress assaults are a demonstration of Crimson Desert’s highs, they simultaneously reveal what could turn out to be some of its biggest blemishes. Battling masses of enemies is surprisingly tedious, feeling messy and repetitive rather than an engaging chain of frontline fights. An awkward lock-on feature pushed me away from one-on-one duels and into a more freeform playstyle, but that came with the baggage of imprecise strikes and occasionally kicking the air instead of faces. Absolutely none of these issues hamper the boss battles, which was my only experience of Crimson Desert prior to this demonstration, and I was quite surprised at how different combat can feel in alternative scenarios, even when using the same moveset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s in these smaller, less refined details where Crimson Desert threatens to lose itself. There are occasions where you need to pick up and manipulate objects, such as planting a banner to inspire your allies. Doing so requires standing still, turning to face the object, activating a focus mode, rapidly tapping a button to lift your target, and then finally manually carry it. All of this is a slightly baffling annoyance when erecting flags, but it turns into a genuine frustration in the middle of a boss battle, when you’re desperately trying to swing a fallen masonry column during the precious few seconds in which the boss is stunned.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, no such awkward Ultrahand juggling is required to extract the power core from Golden Star. As we explored earlier this month in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-how-the-golden-star-dragon-boss-was-created">our making-of feature</a>, this is a boss battle with a unique mechanic that must be discovered in the (quite literal) heat of battle. The dragon’s flaming breath activates an array of pylons dotted around the fortress’ battle arena, which then dispense EMP bombs that you can fire from an arm-mounted cannon. The system creates a repeating phase loop; Golden Star circles above, belching the flames that produce the EMP bombs that will eventually bring him crashing to the ground, where you can unleash a barrage of strikes until he reboots and begins the cycle anew. Pearl Abyss are keen to point out you don’t <em>have </em>to do this – you could, for instance, use lightning-wreathed arrows to apply a stun, or simply chip away at his health bar with ranged attacks – but I feel that the real enjoyment in all of Crimson Desert’s boss fights has been finding the unique mechanic built into the arena or even the enemy itself.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the power core obtained, I take to the skies on the back of my own (completely organic) dragon to attack H.A.L.L’s flying fortress. The initial assault is pretty simple – I have my mount spit fireballs at a number of weak spots in the structure’s shields to break down the defences and allow me to land. But getting inside the fortress itself is more complicated; a navigation puzzle that’s just the right side of obtuse. My journey takes me up elevator shafts and along a precarious route perched on the fortress’ exterior. At one point I have to activate a machine by rotating a wooden pillar that has no crank, achieved by using the thrust attack to bury my blade in the timber to create my own handle. There’s no prompt for this, and I appreciate that the solution is to think about your ability set in a non-conventional manner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such an approach continues inside, where defeating H.A.L.L is more of a puzzle than a traditional challenge of brawn. I like that Crimson Desert’s AI spirit character doesn’t just become another boss brawl – another indicator that the world’s weird steampunk and sci-fi elements actually make some kind of in-universe sense. This time, though, the solution really is obtuse, and someone from Pearl Abyss had to spell it out to me. Hopefully the hours prior to this quest will have equipped you with the knowledge of how to approach this particular foe. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I am a little apprehensive that at least some of Crimson Desert’s offerings will be “stuff to do” rather than meaningful, interlinked opportunities.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">H.A.L.L’s flying fortress isn’t the only airborne destination I visited. Suspended high above Pywel are a scattering of Abyss Islands, accessed through portals that are unlocked with mysterious Abyss Artefacts. These islands appear to come in multiple guises; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-echoes-zelda-and-assassins-creed-with-its-action-packed-open-world">last year</a> we saw that one of them is home to an alchemist called Alustin and his Library of Providence, and my hands-on session included one that was more akin to Zelda’s puzzle shrines. Its checkerboard floor was essentially a room-size circuit board in need of a total rewiring, and finding the correct path through the grid of rotating flagstones unlocks the island’s treasure trove. This is, of course, the sort of puzzle you’ve solved in everything from Watch Dogs to BioShock, but I enjoyed how your equipment is integral to completing it – your lantern illuminates the correct pathway, and your grapple hook is used to spin each tile. So while this challenge is not particularly taxing, I hope its solid foundations are the basis for more interesting puzzles that await among the clouds.    </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve uncovered an Abyss Island’s secrets, you can leap off the side and float down to earth, where plenty more traditional open-world fare awaits. There are towns to visit, in which you’ll find shop keepers to trade with and bounties to take on. Out in the wilderness there are camps to clear out and roaming barbarians to slaughter. And then there’s the factions. From what I glimpsed in the menus, there are dozens and <em>dozens </em>of them, although some will be more important than others, I’m told. A few have their own questline, such as House Wells, a family of nobles led by a Duke who’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-gameplay-ign-first">lost his castle to rebel forces</a> – a situation that’s the catalyst for one of those aforementioned fortress assaults. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert IGN First - Combat and Mounts Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss was quick to clarify that these groups are not like Fallout’s factions, and allegiances with them won’t change the course of the story or impact Crimson Desert’s ending (which is set in stone.) And so I’m left wondering what are the faction quests in aid of? When asked, Pearl Abyss’ design team explained that they were there to ensure the factions felt like significant actors in the plot, and that they offered more content for players to complete. That considered, I am a little apprehensive that at least some of Crimson Desert’s offerings will be “stuff to do” rather than meaningful, interlinked opportunities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to my very first question. What is Crimson Desert as a whole? I know it’s a vast open world with deep, fighting-game inspired combat that works better against bosses than it does against fodder. It’s got spectacle-laden quests that take you from in-the-mud castle assaults all the way up to aerial strikes on a steampunk Death Star. And it’s littered with good time distractions, from fishing to taming bears and buckling up in a battle mech. But I’m still waiting to discover the glue between all this that elevates an open world to new heights. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadow of Mordor has the Nemesis system, which chains its enemies together into a foe-conquering big picture. Red Dead Redemption 2’s systems are united by a pursuit of realism and authenticity that makes its campaign feel like a life lived rather than a game played. And this year’s Ghost of Yotei links every activity on its map to a new unlock on your skill tree, ensuring even little diversions are a growth opportunity. That’s the stuff that’s so far been missing from Crimson Desert’s demonstrations, and the thing I hope will eventually be revealed when I get to play multiple consecutive hours, rather than a collection of isolated quests and bosses. Without it, I still think Crimson Desert stands a solid chance of being an overall good time. But with it, it could become something much more special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Video game crossovers and collabs are nothing new, but in many cases, they are predictable.

These two franchises having the same owner is about all they have in common.</p><p>Season 4 of PGA Tour 2K25 will include a "Mayhem on the Greens" event that brings Borderlands to the golf sim.

<p>After the stellar launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> earlier this year, the next Level-5 project we have to look forward to is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, which <em>should</em> finally arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on 14th November. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> and DECAPOLICE have been delayed to 2026, so we'll have to wait a little longer to get our hands on either of them.</p>
<p>After that, we've got the remade <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/inazuma_eleven_re">Inazuma Eleven RE</a> and whatever Holy Horror Mansion turns out to be. In short, it looks like Level-5 is sticking around for the foreseeable future. Let's just hope that the quality can stick around with it.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Dean Hall, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> and more recently Icarus, has called out Valve regarding the use of gambling-related monetisation methods in its games.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Hall said, "It's something I think Valve does not get anywhere near enough criticism about. I'm honestly disgusted with gambling mechanics in video games at all - they have absolutely no place.</p>
<p>"My challenge to game developers," he added, "is that if they think these things are not a problem, they make the data available to universities who are crying out to study this stuff."</p>
<p>Hall's remarks refer to loot boxes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which offer weapon and armour skins that can be traded with other players and so fuel a multi-billion dollar marketplace surrounding the game - a marketplace that includes significant betting activity.</p><p>Loot boxes have generally been moved away from after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-university-reports-loot-boxes-cause-financial-and-emotional-harm-to-children">multiple countries commissioned investigations into their use</a> and the effect they were having on younger minds. But Valve sidestepped the resulting regulations by changing the loot box system so you pay for the contents inside the box rather than the box itself.</p>
<p>Hall's comments came while speaking to me about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creators-survival-game-icarus-is-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-soon-but-it-wont-have-cross-play">survival game Icarus</a>, which was originally going to be free-to-play before it switched to the expensive DLC model it has now - the Paradox model, as Hall calls it. It's a divisive model but RocketWerkz - Hall's studio - needed to use it in order to survive, he told me.</p>
<p>Players aren't the only ones who are unhappy with it. "I'm not happy either," Hall said. "I agree with a lot of the people who get mad about the DLC approach. I don't really like the Icarus approach. We needed it to survive.</p>
<p>"I actually think a lot of gamers don't realise that 99 percent of devs out there are sitting there going, I don't like this. So who's winning? Because it's sure not us. There's a lot of game studios like mine that are just holding on and trying to keep making the games we want to make, but not necessarily happy with how they monetise."</p>

<figcaption>This is a nice overview of where Kitten Space Agency is at.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2IGlOBWQm8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Hall's answer to this problem may come in Kitten Space Agency, the unashamed and somewhat blatant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> follow-up that RocketWerkz is working on now. The idea is to make it free - free with the option of a contribution if you want to pay.</p><p>"I want to find a different way," he said. "We've got to do something. We've got to try something. And if there's ever a game that deserves trying that, it's a KSP-style game. That's one game I think maybe we can try and do something different with. We say games can inspire, and inspiration should be free, which is kind of a tagline with KSA. I think the game deserves better, I really do - I think the game deserves to be free."</p>
<p>Kitten Space Agency doesn't have a release date yet but testing is starting to open out, albeit to select guests at the moment. Whether or not an optional fee will work for Kitten Space Agency, and whether the income it generates will be enough for RocketWerkz to survive on, remains to be seen. Life has been tough for the New Zealand studio; the launch of Icarus four years ago nearly dragged it under. But as I discussed in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dayz-creator-dean-hall-is-a-changed-man-after-years-of-living-the-high-life-hes-focused-on-saving-a-studio-that-flew-too-close-to-the-sun">a candid interview with Dean Hall</a>, things are starting to turn around.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> is just about to launch on the Switch 2, and to celebrate, Sega has announced another new DLC expansion scheduled to launch this winter.</p>
<p>Dubbed 'Zooseum', it's essentially, well... a zoo. It's a brand new location that will no doubt introduce a smorgasbord of interesting creatures to care for as you look to expand your blossoming museum even further.</p>
<p>Details are rather scarce at the moment, so we don't have a firm release date for the expansion just yet, but it's nice to know that it's coming, at least.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this wild new DLC, a brand new museum location dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife will open its doors. Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our recent review for Two Point Museum, we said that it's probably the best entry in the series yet, but lamented the lack of mouse controls and some apparent performance issues on the Switch 2. Be sure to read our full verdict if you're currently on the fence.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Underwater Survival Game Anchor Mashes Rust and Subnautica Together]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/underwater-survival-game-anchor-mashes-subnautica-rust/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-underwater-survival-game-anchor-mashes-rust-and-subnautica-together.1336075/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Anchor is a new underwater survival game from developer Fearem, which essentially mashes the kind of harsher survival crafting that players love in Rust with the underwater setting of Subnautica to create a new experience.</p>



<p>Set in a dystopian world where a nuclear apocalypse has sent humanity into the ocean to try and find a new way to survive, you'll be able to join up with other players in the 150-player servers or lone shark your underwater journey as you try to survive on your own.</p>



<p>It'll also feature PvE modes for those who don't want to deal with the threat of other players on top of all the other dangers that come with living underwater, which include, but are not limited to, always needing to keep yourself breathing, keeping your shelter intact, and ensuring you don't become shark food.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Anchor - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlbCGRPrVuk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/subnautica-abyss-gazes-back/">Subnautica</a> offered players something entirely new with its alien aquatic setting, Anchor keeps its setting grounded (and wet) with its own version of Earth's oceans. It'll be interesting to see how the rest of marine life, beyond predators like sharks, play a role in Anchor when it does arrive at some point in the future.</p>



<p>For now, the game is set to arrive on PC, with no word of a potential console release in the future. Though that can always change. Hopefully, we'll hear more about when Anchor is due to arrive soon, or at least get a chance to play it at an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest</a> event or something similar.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/squid-game-unleashed-dev-boss-fight-shut-down-by-netflix.1336069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed down&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment, just three years or so after acquiring the developer.</p>

<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-shutters-squid-game-unleashed-developer-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, as well as Boss Fight CEO David Rippy, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-rippy-1b16871_hi-everyone-well-word-has-gotten-around-activity-7387225251513827328-E979/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the studio's closure via his LinkedIn account over the weekend, describing news of the developer's shutdown as "rough".</p>

<p>Netflix's decision to shut down Boss Fight might seem a little strange given that it's only been three years <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-boss-fight-entertainment" rel="nofollow">since the studio was acquired</a>. Not only that, but, as Rippy says in his post, the studio had a bona fide hit on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, which "hit #1 in 26 countries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=M-oDFlDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment.jpg?itok=DtZJaOmR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>developer Boss Fight Entertainment has been shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>Neither Netflix nor Boss Fight gave an official reason for the studio's closure, but Game Developer "understands" that it's all down to new Netflix games president Alain Tascan, who took over from Mike Verdu <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">back in November last year</a>.</p>

<p>Per Game Developer, Tascan's goal with Netflix's gaming division is to focus things more on "party games, children's titles, and narrative experiences" (that's Game Developer's wording, not Tascan's), and Boss Fight's shutdown is a direct result of that paradigm shift.</p>

<p>Despite Boss Fight's shutdown,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game: Unleashed&nbsp;</em>will apparently still receive support from Netflix, so if you're a fan of the game, you don't need to worry about it going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is the second studio Netlfix has (apparently) closed down in the last twelve months or so; last October, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">was reported</a> that the streaming giant had shuttered its all-star Team Blue development outfit, which counted&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>alumni among its number.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=py8ykfwC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-boss-fight-shutdown-team-blue.jpg?itok=ngzK00St 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix also shut down Team Blue, which boasted the involvement of alumni from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, last year.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these shutdowns, Netflix is going all-in on gaming adaptations, with its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series already having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">renewed for a second season</a> and its long-gestating&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">finally going ahead</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rippy and his fellow Boss Fight alumni do after the shutdown of the studio, but we may not hear from them for a while, if Rippy's words are to be believed; he says he and his co-executives will "take a little breather" before moving on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfinder-afterlight-voice-cast-gains-iconic-baldurs-gate-3-actor.1336063/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming CRPG <i>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</i>has gained a brand new voice cast member in the form of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>alumnus Neil Newbon, whose name you'll probably already have seen if you're following the project.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, Newbon will be joining&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>to voice Preach, who'll serve as one of your companions in the upcoming RPG. Preach is a Shirren who's aiming to become a galaxy-renowned High Priest, but it'll be up to you whether or not he succeeds.</p>

<p>Newbon is also serving as the voice director for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>; he's heading up a cast that also includes legends like&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Carolina Ravassa,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>'s Melissa Medina, and long-time voice acting veteran Fred Tatasciore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=kmReiZ0g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-neil-newbon-preach-combat.jpg?itok=HiP9MpwW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Voice director Neil Newbon will be pulling double duty as a voice actor in&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>made its debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starfinder-afterlight-campaign-charges-kickstarter-raising-over-400k" rel="nofollow">via Kickstarter earlier this month</a>, raising over $400,000 in very short order indeed. The game has since passed the $600,000 mark, and it's still got twelve days to go, so there's every chance it'll soar to even greater heights in the next few days.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game only has one more stretch goal to meet, which will happen if the campaign reaches $700,000 (a feat that's looking increasingly likely given how much has already been raised).</p>

<p>That goal will add full voice acting to the game; in the words of developer Epictellers, that means "every aspect of the game, every NPC, every companion bark, every narrative moment, [will be] fully voiced".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the studio manages to reach its final stretch goal, but things are looking pretty bright for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, so I wouldn't be surprised if more goals are added after the fact.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, it's a CRPG based on Paizo's popular tabletop RPG (specifically, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/starfinder-second-edition-playtest-bundle-announced-by-paizo-and-humble-bundle" rel="nofollow">second edition version</a> of said game). It'll see players investigating the disappearance of a spaceship captain, during the course of which the fate of the galaxy will hang in the balance.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Starfinder: Afterlight&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's due to hit Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3245640/Starfinder_Afterlight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> in the second quarter of next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727">PlayStation 2 turned 25 years old this week</a>. I’m sorry if you suddenly feel very old. But don’t worry, I feel old, too! Anyway, to celebrate the milestone, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared some data about the console, including its best-selling games as well as the home console’s most-purchased accessory.</p> <p>On October 26, 2000, Sony launched the PS2 in North America, and it quickly became one of the most successful video game console releases in history. In the United States alone, the console would go on to sell over 45 million units, and globally it has shipped 160 million, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles">making it the best-selling console ever</a>. (Though the Nintendo Switch will likely overtake it in the near future.) Over the course of the console’s lifecycle, thousands of PlayStation 2 games were released for it. Not all of them were great, but the machine does still indeed boast one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-ps2-games-rare-playstation-console-sony-retro-1790020087">best console game libraries around</a>.</p>

 <p>To celebrate the console’s 25th birthday in America, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m44bjwl5n22h">Piscatella posted some fun stats about the PS2 on social media</a>. Did you know that the 8mb memory card was the PS2’s most sold accessory with a 61-percent attach rate? Overall, 147 million accessories were sold in the United States for the PS2. Wowza. And for those curious, here are the top 20 best-selling PlayStation 2 games of all time based on unit sales.</p> <p><strong>US Top 20 All-Time Best-Selling PS2 Games (Jan 1999 – Sep 2025)&nbsp;</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto III&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2005</em></li> <li><em>Guitar Hero II&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2004</em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2006</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2007</em></li> <li><em>Jampack Series: PlayStation 2</em></li> <li><em>Madden NFL 2003</em></li> <li><em>Need for Speed: Underground&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li> <li><em>Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition</em></li> <li><em>Final Fantasy X</em></li> <li><em>Gran Turismo 4: The Real Driving Simulator</em></li> <li><em>God of War</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor: Frontline</em></li> </ol> <p>While I expected the <em>GTA</em> games to top the chart, I was surprised to see <em>Medal of Honor: Frontline, Final Fantasy X,</em> and <em>God of War</em> crack the list, too. Also, wow, EA really was a force to be reckoned with back then, huh? What a different time for video games. Then again, <em>GTA</em> leading the pack hasn’t changed much in 2025, so I guess the more things change…</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many who’ve already picked up a copy of RV There Yet?, you’ve contributed to the game’s incredible early success, which has seen RV There Yet? hit 1.3 million copies sold on Steam—and counting.</p>



<p>We’ve waxed lyrical about this year’s big indie breakouts: Schedule 1, REPO, PEAK, and Ball X Pit. It’s time to add another one to the growing list, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> is already going above and beyond ‘overnight sensation’ status.</p>

<p>RV There Yet? is the manic game where you need to escape Route 65, and do so with the help of your trusty RV. You can do so with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-can-play-rv-there-yet-max-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few players</a>, and its concept and stylings lean somewhat toward PEAK.</p>



<p>This is a unique game, though, let’s not get this twisted. It has a clear identity and a wacky brand of violence, miscommunication, and a party-heavy flavor. This is why RV There Yet? has sold <strong>1,288,515 copies in under seven days on Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>The sales figure was revealed by Jace Varlet, the community manager for Nuggets Entertainment, in a YouTube video on the game’s initial progress and success. It’s clear that the game is selling unbelievably well—thanks to its affordable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-cost-free-to-play-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price tag</a>—and it seems like a matter of time before new sales milestones are hit, very quickly.</p>

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8k1g3vMDU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield REDSEC official gameplay trailer</a> is now scheduled for premiere at 8 a.m. PT / 11 a.m. ET tomorrow, October 28, with its description teasing a surprise launch. The news follows months of rumors and leaks, suggesting that Battlefield 6 battle royale was nearly here.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have enjoyed Battlefield 6 since it first landed for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10 expected to hear news of a proper, complimentary battle royale experience when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-trailer-highlights-blackwell-fields-and-eastwood-maps-ahead-of-next-weeks-launch"><u>Season 1 was properly unveiled last week</u></a>. As first details of EA and BF Studios’ latest came and went, however, there was no sign of what many had expected to be a substantial new game mode to drop into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was strange, especially as hints of a Battlefield 6 battle royale game mode <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-battlefield-leak-reveals-extremely-brief-look-at-the-start-of-a-battle-royale-match-as-ea-issues-takedowns"><u>began to leak as early as July 2025</u></a>. The popular, last-squad-standing experience is nothing new for the franchise and remains popular among shooter fans, so with Battlefield promising a return to its roots with destructible environments and gritty gameplay, another stab at battle royale felt like a no-brainer at the time. Community manager Kevin Johnson then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-getting-battle-royale-releases-chaotic-teaser-trailer"><u>confirmed BF Studios had indeed begun work on such a mode in August</u></a>, adding that only those involved in the Battlefield 6 closed test program, Battlefield Labs, would get to play at first.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Official updates have been quiet since, but that didn’t stop Labs testers from drumming up hype. Battlefield battle royale <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6s-battle-royale-footage-has-leaked-heres-what-it-shows-us"><u>gameplay snuck its way online in September</u></a>, confirming that things like swimming, combat, and destruction had been translated over to this new experience. Just as quickly as EA stamped out leaks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-gameplay-highlights-multiplayer-combat-in-latest-bf-labs-leak"><u>more soon popped up on social media</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A battle royale game mode for Battlefield 6 Season 1 was all but confirmed, even as news of the first major content drop passed without confirmation from BF Studios. Things then really heated up last Friday, when <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981741907387523203" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online"><u>battle royale would shadow-drop alongside the first Battlefield 6 season with the title Battlefield REDSEC</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with so little in terms of official word from the developers, a Battlefield 6 battle royale shadow-drop seems all but confirmed for tomorrow morning. Labs leaks date back months ago, so there’s no telling what content made it into the Battlefield REDSEC launch build.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll know more about the new Battlefield 6 game mode when the trailer premieres in less than 24 hours. Until then, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-will-leak-everything-battlefield-6-devs-insist-they-didnt-want-the-game-to-suffer-from-leaks-but-getting-player-feedback-had-to-come-at-any-cost">how EA and BF Studios did their best to combat leakers – even if they knew it was an uphill battle</a>.

Complete quests, roll spins for perks, and customize your character to be the ultimate zombie-slaying machine.

It seems like a safe bet that there will eventually be another God of War game, and if there is, Christopher Judge wants it to take place in Egypt.</p><p>Judge--who first rose to fame for starring in Stargate SG-1 as Teal'c--has voiced Kratos since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a> in 2018. The original games set Kratos against the Greek pantheon of gods, while the last two games centered on the Norse gods. For a new title, Judge recently disclosed that he would like to return to some of the Egyptian mythology from Stargate.</p><p>"Because I became best known as Teal'c from Stargate, to go to Egypt would be a completion of my circle," said Judge during his recent appearance at MCM London Comic Con (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war-actor-christopher-judge-says-he-hopes-a-potential-sequel-will-take-place-in-egypt-but-i-have-no-doubt-that-no-matter-what-pantheon-it-is-it-will-be-great/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>).
