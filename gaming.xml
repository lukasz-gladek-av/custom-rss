			<p>Among the many new game announcements featured in yesterday's PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025, Deepest Fear certainly stands out as one of the most intriguing.&nbsp;It is being developed by Variable State, a British independent studio known for games like Virginia, Last Stop, and the upcoming Polaris.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Deepest Fear is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter game featuring inspirations from the likes of James Cameron, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Paul Verhoven in terms of atmosphere. On the other hand, Metroid Prime, Half-Life 2, System Shock 2, and Dead Space were cited as inspirations for the gameplay, which is said to mix Metroidvania design with immersive simulation elements, allowing the player to come up with interesting solutions to the various situations presented throughout the game.</p>
<p>There's also a particular twist in that Deepest Fear features a full-fledged real-time fluid simulation, which protagonist Dr. Danni Carrol will use to fight otherworldly entities that manifest spontaneously from any water source. Moreover, the surrounding environment can flood and take in water at any moment, sweeping her away with unpredictable currents and plunging the protagonist into the suffocating depths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/founder-access-for-eve-frontier-announced-closed-alpha-starts-december-10/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games announced Founder Access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, which gives those who purchased it the opportunity to have a say on features within the space survival simulation game while also being given access to the in-development build of the game on a continuous basis. This access begins on December 10, when those who hold the Founder Access pass will be able to join the exclusive, always-on server in Closed Alpha. This gives them the opportunity to provide crucial feedback to the developers and leave their mark on the game before it is released.</p>
<p>Releasing Founder Access marks the start of the next phase of development of EVE Frontier by allowing those who have purchased the pass to access it permanent pre-launch access. By doing this, it means that players will be able to play and experience EVE Frontier before it has launched and will be able to give feedback to the developers on features that may need tweaking or adding or even bug fixes that CCP Games may have missed. Of course, that is not the only thing that players can get by purchasing Founder Access. Players will also get additional benefits, such as name reservations, cosmetics, Discord roles, and special access to CCP Games Developer streams. Additionally, when the game launches in the future as free-to-play, Founders will be able to redeem their included premium subscription time.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official 'First Look'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0sOVGHEyCnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>CCP Games CEO Hilmar Veigar Pétursson said:</p>
<p><em>In EVE Frontier we are deepening the contribution and connection players have over a living galaxy. A virtual world where developers and players are equals, where the rules apply to all. Our long-term vision is to create an open ecosystem built, operated, and governed by the Frontier's inhabitants themselves.</em></p>
<p>From today, those interested will be able to purchase Founder Access to EVE Frontier, with three different tiers to purchase. The cheapest tier is $29.99 and includes a Unique Awakened Portrait and one month of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time. The second tier, named Initiated, is $59.99, including two exclusive skins, a portrait, two months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, and a 24-hour early start at launch.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the third tier, which is the most expensive and provides the most benefits. This comes with a unique Ascended Portrait and three exclusive skins. You'll also get four months of Premium Post-Launch Subscription Time, a Name Reservation, and a 72-hour early start at launch. To get all of these benefits, you'll have to pay $89.99.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/m80-acquires-beastcoast-and-throws-manchester-r6-major-champs-out-in-the-cold.1053627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m80-acquire-beastcoast-rainbow-six-team-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>M80 has moved to acquire Beastcoast, adding the likes of Dota 2 and Pokémon-focused esports to an already stacked roster. The organisation will now cover these games in addition to Rainbow Six Siege, Counter-Strike 2, and VALORANT, but the move hasn’t been completed without a few upsets.</p>



<p>The losers of this deal are represented by Beastcoast’s former Rainbow Six Siege team, which claimed a victory at the BLAST R6 Major in Manchester, England earlier this year. They’re now left without an organisation to represent at the Six Invitational 2025, which is fast approaching.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-last-minute-change">Last-Minute Change</h2>



<p>M80 posted on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>M80 is pleased to announce we have acquired Beastcoast and their esports and media businesses. Excited to welcome them to the M80 family!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June, Beastcoast and Cloud9 partnered in the Rainbow Six Siege space ahead of the Esports World Cup. It didn’t turn out to be too fruitful a partnership, given that the team failed to qualify for the EWC, but it was also a very short-lived one. Per the <a href="https://m80.gg/article/m80-acquires-beastcoast-moves-into-dota2-pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement released by M80</a>, some key staff members are being pulled over from Beastcoast, but it’s bad news for some:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of the acquisition, M80 will absorb several of Beastcoast’s esports operations – including a top team in DOTA 2 – one of the largest Pokemon media businesses in gaming, and key staff, including CEO Grant Zinn. </p>



<p>In his new role at M80, Zinn will serve as Chief Business Development Officer, where he will support M80’s expansion and double-down on fandom in exciting, but underserved esports like Pokemon and fast-growing regions like South America.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The core trio that represented Beastcoast – Hotancold, SpiriTz, and Gaveni – has been left out in the cold following this move. They’ve resigned to stay together and add a couple of new players to their squad, but they currently have no banner to fly at the Six Invitational, which takes place in Boston in February.</p>



<p>Previous members of the Beastcoast roster, dfuzr and Gunnar, have unknown futures ahead of them.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Beastcoast beat Team BDS in an unlikely finish in Manchester to secure the trophy at the BLAST R6 Major, the first such win for the organisation in Rainbow Six.</p>

You can begin “Drawing” at your base.</p><p><em>—You can turn on guide lines, so that you will not lose your place when drawing.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>—You are not limited to human characters. It is possible to create characters of all types of shapes, including sushi or fish.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—By making the feet like seaweed, you can make it look like your fish character is swimming.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_004.png"></a></figure><p>If you feel like it is too difficult to draw from scratch, you can choose from 90 types of existing characters to start, and then create your own based off of it.</p><p>It is possible to edit portions of a character, so let’s create a character with pigtails using an existing character as a base.</p><p><em>—We are going to edit this side-ponytail character to create a pigtailed character. You can choose from three skin colors and 10 hair colors.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Take the original hair, copy and paste, and adjust the position by flipping the pasted hair.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Now you have easily created a character with pigtails!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>If you are new to this “Draw” tool, try editing an existing character.</p><p>Not only can you create the front of your character, but you can also create facial expressions such as when your character takes damage. In addition, you can create walking or running animation, as well as attachments, such as weapons, armor, and wings.</p><p><em>—Customization isn’t limited to appearance. Your character’s name, description, dialogue, and even your standby motion can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_009.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_010.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editing Tool: “Music”</strong></p><p>In the <em>Cladun</em> series, players are also able to create their own background music and sound effects. It is a bit hard to use and could take some time to get used to, but do try this tool starting from this entry in the series.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>Compared to the last entry, <em>Cladun X3</em> allows for more expressions through more tones. New capabilities to set tone, envelopes, pink noise, and macro have been added, allowing for stronger expressions. In addition, you are allowed four times more characters compared to previous entries, which will let you create longer compositions.</p><p>To those who want to make music, but are intimidated by the process, we plan to release support tools on our official website.</p><p>Created music can be set as background music to the map of your created town, and can also be sent to other players through the “Network” tool.</p><p><em>—The available “Sample Music” can be used as background music as well. Background music of the Story Dungeon can be changed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_013.jpg"></a></figure><p>By creating and setting background music that fits your created map, it creates better atmosphere to your town.</p><p><strong>■ Network Advanced Mode: Create Your Own Map and Share With Other Users</strong></p><p>In the “Advanced Mode” of “Network,” you can share maps, characters, and background music with other players.</p><p>In Advanced Mode, you can create your own Town Maps and then upload them for other players to see. You can also download maps that other players have created and explore.</p><p><strong>Town Map Creation Mode: Create Maps</strong></p><p>You can create a variety of maps, from maps that fit your created character, to maps that you yourself would like to explore.</p><p>Choose from a variety of chips located at the top of the screen, and place them anywhere on the map.</p><p><em>—There are many types of chips, and they can be chosen through the “Chips List” for use in map creation.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_014.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—Chips can have either “Floor” or “Wall” properties.

You can decide your characters’ dialogue, whether they walk or not, whether they open up shop when talked to, and many other settings.</p><p><em>—The behaviors of characters can be set in great detail—whether they walk or not, talk, open shop when interacted, provide maps after being talked to, and changing the music following interactions.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_021.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—You can actually purchase items through the shop.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_022.png"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cladun-X3_2024_12-06-24_023.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Internet Upload: Share Your Map With Other Players</strong></p><p>If you’d like other people to play your maps and see your characters, try uploading your creations to the Internet! Other players of <em>Cladun X3</em> may come and pay your maps a visit.</p><p><em>—Using “Network” to upload your characters and maps makes it possible for other players to freely download your creations.

A maximum of 900 Town Maps can be connected. Towns of the same atmosphere can be created to create a large city. Town Maps that have hidden “Magic Maps” can be strung together and explored at once. There are many ways to use and enjoy maps!</p><p><em>—Detailed information can be seen, such as if a map has cartographs and if they have characters placed in them.

<p>The Esports World Cup is set to return in 2025 in Riyadh. Over the next month or so, the EWC team will be announcing the full line-up of games appearing at the event, which is expected to top 2024’s showcase in every way possible. It’s the most valuable event in esports where sponsorship and prizes are concerned, and it’s a competitive ground for a staggering array of titles.</p>



<p>Here’s every game announced for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-every-game-at-the-ewc-2025">Every Game at the EWC 2025</h2>



<p>This list is subject to evolve as the EWC team unveils more games, but here’s the full breakdown so far:</p>



<p><strong>Games Confirmed for Esports World Cup 2025:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>



<li>Honor of Kings</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone</li>



<li>Free Fire</li>



<li>Street Fighter 6</li>



<li>Dota 2</li>



<li>Rainbow Six Siege</li>
</ul>



<p>By the end of January, every game appearing at the Esports World Cup 2025 will have been announced.</p>



<p>The 2024 iteration of the Esports World Cup was a monumental event that saw tens of millions of dollars handed out in prizes. Some of the most prolific competitors in the esports world took to the stage in Riyadh, and despite concerns about the setting of the event, it managed to secure solid viewership worldwide.</p>



<p>I had a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-ralf-reichert-esports-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview Ralf Reichert</a>, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, as the first EWC event came to a close:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t go into detail yet on what you can expect at future events, one thing to be sure of is our commitment to deliver a one-of-a-kind celebration of competitive excellence and gaming culture for our global fans. We’ve set a new standard, and it’s our responsibility to raise it going forward.</p>



<p>All this is part of Vision 2030 and how Saudi has embraced a forward-looking attitude that creates a perfect home for the Esports World Cup. There is long-term thought here that makes me very optimistic about the future of gaming and esports in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region as a whole.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games is hard at work preparing the next major update for Escape from Tarkov. In a series of images uploaded on social media, the team revealed snapshots of the ‘Customs rework’, an overhaul being made to what many consider to be Tarkov’s most popular map.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed when the Customs rework will drop, but it’s expected that it’ll arrive in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Tarkov wipe</a>, due to drop later this month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Customs is an extremely popular map in Escape from Tarkov, as it’s often the first environment most players will come to explore when they pick up the game. It’s the host of several early-game tasks, and it has some great PvP engagement areas as well as a couple of boss encounters that make for high XP, high loot runs.</p>



<p>In a series of images uploaded on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov revealed some of the updates being made to Customs.</p>



<p>It started with a shot of a much more detailed and immersive ‘New Gas’ interior, and then hours later, Buyanov showed some new interiors showing remarkable attention to detail.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games overhauled Factory, taking the small-form map that had existed for almost a decade and turning it into something much more expansive and complex. It became ten times more detailed overnight, with the update adding much more verticality and depth to the iconic map.</p>



<p>In recent years, the squad at BSG has been working to expand and alter almost every map in the game, and it’s all in preparation for Tarkov launching as a full-release game, in ‘1.0’. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-card-game-project-k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-k-league-of-legends-card-game-revealed-by-riot-games.1053606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-card-game-project-k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games has unveiled a League of Legends TCG that’s going by the name Project K. In a four-minute video uploaded today, the team introduced Project K, marketing it as a ‘League IP game that we think deeply serves the need of a different kind of audience’. It’s set to feature recognisable locations, characters, and abilities pulled straight from the League universe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-table">To The Table</h2>



<p>Project K is an ambitious game that Riot Games dubbed ‘the best social TCG out there and something that you will really enjoy’. It’s designed to be played with a group in an ideal world, but one-on-one gameplay is also entirely supported.</p>



<p>The team envisions a competitive ecosystem that starts at the grassroots level but escalates to global tournaments.</p>



<p>In the introduction video, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to get cards into everyone’s hands as soon as possible. But we do want to ensure that wherever you live, you have the best experience from your day one, including that competitive ecosystem and of course, cards and accessories in your language.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Project K will launch first in China, with Riot Games having already identified a manufacturer and distributor in the region. The English versions of the launch box set will be available to pre-order later this year. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Admittedly, the introduction video was light on the gameplay details, which is uncharacteristic for a TCG that intends to launch internationally within a few months. And of course, many fans were quick to make comparisons to Legends of Runeterra – which surfaces in Project K in some artistic decisions.</p>

<p>Electronic Arts has once again made good on a promise to support inclusivity and accessibility in the games industry. Recently, the company unlocked 23 patents tied to accessibility, including speech recognition and photosensitivity innovations. In 2021, the team pledged to share in-house technology with the wider industry.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sharing-is-caring">Sharing is Caring</h2>



<p>On December 5, Electronic Arts made 23 patents open-source, making them available to third-party developers operating outside of EA. These patents mostly concern speech-based technology and testing tools that recognise photosensitivity issues.</p>



<p>One key deliverable is an Unreal Engine 5 plugin that unlocks EA’s IRIS technology, an analytical tool that can help developers identify photosensitivity issues in their game while testing. It’s now free to use and open-source, which means developers are free to ‘play around’ with the software.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on EA’s blog</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For years now, EA has strived to make gaming&nbsp;as inclusive as possible&nbsp;and to minimize barriers between our players and our shared love for video games. And today, in this spirit and following International Day of Persons with Disabilities we have added 23 accessibility-centered patents to our&nbsp;industry-first accessibility patent pledge. </p>



<p>Through this pledge, launched in 2021, we share our accessibility-related technology with the wider industry royalty-free, so that together we can work towards meeting the needs of our diverse gaming community at EA and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>IRIS works by identifying potential issues in a game such as flashing lights and sequences that could trigger something like an epileptic fit or seizure. It compares visuals against a simple baseline that tracks in real-time, assessing whether a sequence is a pass, warning, or fail. </p>



<p>Previously, EA has delivered patents focused on text issues, such as Fontikk, a tool that was open-sourced in 2022 that analyses text to determine its readability.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good move by EA, or is it just a ploy to earn some positive PR? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Reveals AI Tech That Can Create Playable 3D Games in Seconds]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/google-reveals-ai-tech-that-can-create-playable-3d-games-in-seconds.1053597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/google-genie-2-ai-tech-3d-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Google has unveiled Genie 2, a revolutionary AI-driven technology that can generate playable 3D environments based on image or text-based prompts in seconds, depending on the level of compute used. In a blog post, the DeepMind team shared footage of explorable worlds being traversed after being created by Genie 2 based on nothing but an initial text prompt.</p>



<p>It’s rudimentary at this stage, but it’s a direct evolution of Genie 1, which could generate 2D environments. It’s enough to make you wonder what Genie 3 might look like, that’s for sure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-age-of-ai">The Age of AI</h2>



<p>Developers have been toying with AI for a while to <strong>aid </strong>game development, but Genie 2 goes one step further. This technology is a foundational step towards using AI to generate an entire game, as shown by the DeepMind team in a recent blog post.</p>



<p>In one clip, the team prompts Genie 2 to generate ‘a playable world driving a sailboat on a lake’, and although what follows is <span><strong>obviously</strong></span> an AI-generated segment, it’s exactly what the prompt asked for.</p>



<p>In another scene, it’s a robot running around a forest, and in another, it’s someone exploring an abandoned spaceship.</p>



<p>Here’s a description of <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genie 2 from DeepMind</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Genie 2 is a&nbsp;<em>world model</em>, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). </p>



<p>It was trained on a large-scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s still limited, though. Genie 2 can only generate consistent worlds for up to 60 seconds. In the showcase, everything from racing gamers to platformers was explored, with Genie 2 going so far as to create interactable environments containing bursting balloons, working doors, and exploding barrels.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/deepmind.mp4"></video></figure>







<p>It can even accurately render reflections and directional lighting, and it can take a single shot of concept art and use it to bring that envisioned environment to life.</p>



<p>Is this technology dangerous or do you want to see more of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

While collectors will certainly be interested in the game, it's also a fun title for younger players, especially since the co-op mode lets parents and kids easily play together.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">This actually isn't the only physical edition of Rugrats: Adventures in Gameland made by Limited Run Games.

                <p>Walmart might be trying to clear out its inventory of select video game-inspired mini fridges, because two of the coolest little coolers are now available for only $29 each. Minecraft fans can grab an officially licensed mini fridge modeled after the iconic Creeper mob from the game.

These run louder and aren't as good at chilling drinks, so they aren't as practical as real mini fridges. But for $29, these are pretty cool novelty devices, whether you wind up using them to store cans of Game Fuel or as little cabinets on your desk for storing accessories.</p><p>If you're interested in buying a themed mini fridge or thermoelectric cooler this holiday, Walmart has a number of other budget-friendly options that we've listed at the end of this article.</p><div title="[Various] Minecraft Mini Fridge" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2945" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Minecraft Mini Fridge" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value">Minecraft Creeper Mini Fridge (25 Inches, 8L)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2670909566&amp;subId1=subid_value">$29 (was $168)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F2670909566%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft Creeper</a> is 25.2 x 9.5 x 9.1 inches and has eight liters of storage capacity across its two compartments. You can store four 12 ounce cans of your favorite drink inside the Creeper's head and eight cans inside its hollow body. Both compartments have removable shelves, so taller, bottled drinks can be stored as well (just not as many).</p><p>If you're storing anything besides drinks, you'll want to keep the Creeper's cooling limitations in mind. It's capable of cooling up to 32 degrees Fahrenheit below ambient temperature. Depending on how cool you keep your home, the temperature inside the cooler might not get as low as it needs to be to safely store certain food and drink products. Kitchen refrigerators operate at 40 degrees or below.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value">Xbox Series X Thermoelectric Cooler (14.4 Inches, 4.5L)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/414202579&amp;subId1=subid_value">$29 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F414202579%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Xbox Series X Mini Fridge</a> received less-than-stellar reviews when it released back in 2021. There were several reasons for this. Many Xbox fans thought it was a true mini fridge, not a thermoelectric cooler that resembles a mini fridge.</p><p>Also, be warned: it's quite loud--loud enough that there's a chance it'll annoy you enough to unplug it. It's also small, measuring in at 14.4 x 7.3 x 7.3 inches. For a frame of reference, the Xbox Series X console is 11.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches. The fridge has one door and 4.75L of storage space. You can snugly fit eight cans of Mountain Dew Game Fuel inside.</p><p>It has one removable shelf that can be placed in two slots: in the center if you plan on storing cans, or at the top if you want to place bottled drinks inside. It also has a small basket on the interior door for storing.... something. Just like with the Creeper, be careful with perishable food and drink products, as this one is limited to 36 degrees below room temperature, slightly worse than the Creeper.</p><p>The Xbox logo on the front of the fridge lights up just like the power button on the real console. It also has green LED lights on top that shine through the cooling grate.</p><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXBOX-3-2CF-1D-FRIDGE%2F3082591196%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-minecraft-creeper-mini-fridge-is-on-sale-for-only-29-at-walmart%2F1100-6528276%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2023 Xbox Series X Mini Fridge</a> is larger, operates as a real fridge, and runs quieter.

A demo is available now. <span id="more-931778"></span></p><p>“<em>The Great Villainess</em> explores an alternate reality where mass media could be perceived as mystical powers,” said WSS playground CEO Daichi Saito in a press release. “We encourage all who test the demo to lend their voice to development, we look forward to your feedback!”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via the companies:</p><blockquote><p>Escape false murder accusations as Scarlet, a hedonistic duchess guilty only of disobeying the aristocracy’s tiresome customs. Flee the imperial armies eager to see Scarlet’s head roll and buy time until she can clear her name. Conspire with Lily, a time-traveling live streamer, and convince the opposing generals of Scarlet’s innocence, win their loyalty…and perhaps even form a rebellion.</p><p>In an era without the internet, leverage the power of media to outwit enemy forces. Hop aboard an imperial airship, spread (occasionally fake) news from above, and sway public opinion to increase the odds of victory during every battle. </p><p>Strengthen Scarlet’s army with her winsome ways: capture prisoners of war, then sway them with propaganda. Plant seeds of doubt into the minds of opposing commanders to cut off supply chains, divert troops away from battlegrounds, and flank distracted squadrons to thin out their ranks.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been over 30 years since I wore out my VHS copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-1989-had-batman-ghostbusters-indiana-jones-freddy-and-more-and-the-box-office-was-never-the-same-again">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>. Since then the film franchise has been in a state of escalation. Where do you go after uncovering the literal Holy Grail? Aliens, then time machines, apparently. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the perfect antidote to all of this; one that uses its own figurative <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review">Dial of Destiny</a> to propel us back in time to Indy’s prime. The result is easily one of the best Indy stories across both the games <em>and</em> the movies, with painstakingly detailed environments, wonderfully atmospheric tomb raiding and puzzle solving, a pitch-perfect score, and quite possibly the greatest punch sound effect in the business. While it does stumble occasionally as a stealth-focused sneak ’em up, The Great Circle is an otherwise grand and gorgeous globe-trotting adventure that left me giddy as a schoolboy. Yes, it’s true that bringing Indiana Jones back to the big screen (twice) after he literally rode off into the sunset was probably a poor choice. But having MachineGames craft an Indy experience inspired by all the best games in that development team’s past?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda chose wisely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">MachineGames’ most immediate legacy is the modern Wolfenstein series, and there’s certainly some of that on show in The Great Circle. Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/20/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review">The New Order</a> and its excellent prequel and sequel, The Great Circle is first-person and highly story-driven, and I’d wager if there’s anyone who hates Nazis as much as Indy, it’s the Gestapo-gutting, SS-slaying BJ Blazkowicz. The Great Circle is not, however, a bloodthirsty exercise in double-fisted, lead-flinging fury. Unlike Wolfenstein, The Great Circle’s focus is patient and slower-paced exploration and stealth – where guns are rarely (and barely) a viable option. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, with the founding members of MachineGames all hailing from fellow Swedish studio Starbreeze, MachineGames’ DNA admittedly runs much deeper than Wolfenstein. For many of the team, it dates back to 2004’s outstanding and highly acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/29/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay">The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay</a>. Riddick’s first-person fisticuffs and adventure elements appear to have been a huge inspiration on The Great Circle, and it’s refreshing to be playing a game like Butcher Bay again – particularly when it’s done with this much verve and commitment to a storied franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For clarity, I doubt anybody would’ve been shocked to see an Indiana Jones game in 2024 arrive as a clone of the blockbuster Uncharted series. It certainly wouldn’t have been unprecedented. After all, both 1999’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/16/indiana-jones-and-the-infernal-machine">Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</a> and 2003’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/02/indiana-jones-and-the-emperors-tomb-3">Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb</a> both followed a fairly strict <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review">Tomb Raider</a> template. Pivoting to pay tribute to the man who usurped Lara as the premier grave-robbing vagabond of modern video games would hardly have been surprising – particularly as games today have become increasingly homogenised overall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Great Circle isn’t an Uncharted clone, and it’s all the better for it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But The Great Circle <em>isn’t</em> an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review">Uncharted</a> clone, and it’s all the better for it. It’s an Indiana Jones game I didn’t even know I wanted, and sometimes that’s the best surprise. I like highly cinematic, quality third-person shooters as much as the next man, but not <em>every </em>game needs to be one. And besides, you can do a lot worse than taking notes from Butcher Bay – another licensed tie-in with the extremely rare distinction of being even better than the film upon which it was based.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genius of the Restoration</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first-person perspective blesses The Great Circle with a fantastic sense of scale. Looking up in awe of the Great Pyramid – or staring out at a giant Nazi battleship perched atop a mountain in the Himalayas – simply has a more pronounced effect at eye-level. It also does wonders for immediacy, with puzzle solving in particular benefitting greatly. Picking up and poring over documents and clues, directly manipulating and placing objects, and watching the results unfold in front of your eyes makes it feel like you’re personally inside some of the world’s most expensive escape rooms. Puzzles come regularly, and they’re mostly light lifting, but I’ve encountered at least a couple of slightly curlier ones that left me smugly satisfied that I wasn’t stumped. If you do hit a roadblock, there’s a baked-in hint system that will only interject if you take an extra photo of the offending puzzle with your in-game camera. It’s a smart and courteous way of offering aid only when asked that will keep players off their phones and in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this, it’s really the best showcase for the incredible amount of granular detail MachineGames has stuffed into seemingly every surface in The Great Circle. From streak marks on freshly wiped glass to the slow trickle of wax from a candle lighting your way down an ancient stairwell, these are things that wouldn’t be noticed from any other viewpoint. Are they entirely necessary to make The Great Circle a great game? Maybe not, but they <em>do </em>paint a picture of a project where no flourish is too small if they make the world look and feel even a <em>fraction </em>more authentic. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After beginning with a short flashback to Raiders of the Lost Ark as a tutorial – one that might’ve been a tad indulgent had it not been so utterly well done – The Great Circle’s second level is a wonderful (and equally nostalgic) trip through Connecticut’s Marshall College. It’s a magnificent rendition and draped in layers upon layers of bespoke details that distracted me constantly on my way to the objective. Busts and other paraphernalia related to the history of the school. Cabinets full of exotic items. Notice boards cluttered with handmade signs. If you’d shown this version of Indy’s famous school to the eight-year-old version of me who cut his teeth aimlessly point-and-clicking his way around Marshall College in 1989’s Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, I might have had you burnt at the stake. Or at least lowered into a sacrificial lava pit without a heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The eye-catching environments keep coming: The ornate Italian architecture and crusty catacombs of Vatican City; An ancient town and multiple Nazi dig sites in the shadow of the Egyptian pyramids and the Great Sphinx; Sukhothai’s winding waterways and flooded temples, which are being reclaimed by the jungle. It’s all excellent stuff, and bolstered by exemplary ray-traced lighting to boot. I love the huge contrasts between the levels, and “the great circle” as a fanciful archaeological concept is an admirably effective premise to justify Indy hopping all over the globe during a single story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>David Shaughnessy's unerring version of Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The strength of that story here is one of The Great Circle’s true assets, and it’s been brought to life with some very impressive performances. For the most part, Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impersonation is close to spot-on, and Baker’s otherwise distinct voice disappears in the role. Credit too must go to voice actor David Shaughnessy, whose unerring version of Denholm Elliot’s Marcus Brody may go criminally unnoticed in Baker’s shadow. This could have very much felt like a gimmick considering Elliot passed away back in 1992, but Brody’s small role feels meaningful and respectful, and not like a stunt. Marios Gavrilis also kills it as the slimy and sinister Nazi archaeologist Emmerich Voss; he spits his dialogue with such venom I imagine his microphone may have required a tiny umbrella. Most of the meaningful conversations occur in well-directed cutscenes, which are on par with those in modern Wolfenstein, albeit punctuated with an appropriate amount of slightly slapstick Indiana Jones humour when the fists start flying. There are basically <em>two movies</em> worth of cutscenes here, but it never felt like too much. This is Indy in his prime, and I’m on board for every extra minute of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a rule, the Indiana Jones series is always at its best when it involves a desperate race to track down an artifact before the Nazis can nab it for what they believe will be an unbeatable, world-conquering advantage. Those movies were video game fetch quests before video game fetch quests, and The Great Circle naturally embraces it, immediately beginning on the right foot by setting its action in 1937 – directly between the events of Raiders and The Last Crusade, as the world simmers towards the Second World War. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s honestly quite remarkable how convincingly The Great Circle fits into the hole between those two impeccable films, successfully exploiting the odd chronology of the original Indy trilogy. That goes far beyond just providing a little extra context on Indy’s separation from Marion Ravenwood, too. In fact, one of the greatest compliments I can pay The Great Circle is that it may well be the best Indiana Jones movie you’ve never seen. The music, too, is a victory on all fronts, and I love how in sync it feels with Raiders and The Last Crusade. I was especially thrilled to see The Great Circle crescendo to a showdown that follows tightly in the footsteps of both of those films – yet still managed to knock me out with a brilliantly unexpected twist.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Aid our own resuscitation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of knockouts, combat in The Great Circle is satisfyingly brutal without being gratuitously violent, which is in keeping with its family-friendly, swashbuckling adventure serial roots. I love the deeply impressive sound design, which makes every strike sound like a golf club being slammed into a huge bunch of celery, and I love how visceral the fighting is in first-person. You block and parry blows with the correct timing, and deliver quick jabs and loaded up power punches. On top of that, Indy’s bullwhip can be used to quickly disarm enemies, and stun them long enough to either wade in and whack them or scoop up their dropped weapon and bludgeon them with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy how Butcher Bay-adjacent the fighting is but I’m a little unconvinced by the stamina system that rules over it, which depletes as Indy exerts himself climbing, sprinting, and throwing hands. It just creates pauses throughout the action where you’ll be compelled to wait for a beat, or jog backwards as a gaggle of goose-stepping morons march towards you with their dukes up. I can’t really detect what it adds other than something to be arbitrarily upgraded to the point where it’s no longer an inconvenience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat escalates with your actions so, if you do grab a gun and start blasting, expect all armed enemies in your vicinity to respond with hot lead of their own. Indy can’t survive this kind of barrage so, for the most part, the best thing to do is forget the firearms. This does, admittedly, create a bit of silliness if you stir up a large enemy response and park yourself anywhere your attackers need to climb to reach. You can, for instance, stand at the top of a ladder and clobber the crap out of everyone who climbs it for some time, and no one will figure out that they have guns and can simply shoot at you (on regular difficulty, at least). But you’d be colouring outside the lines here, playing like this. Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake when necessary, but he’s not some moustache-twirling mass murderer. You can always fire up Wolfenstein if you need to get some of that out of your system.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Indy doesn’t mind leaving bodies in his wake, but he’s not some mass murderer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of guns, though, Indy’s personal revolver is sadly a big disappointment. I used it all of twice, but both were still total anticlimaxes. The first was an early boss battle where Indy’s pistol really should’ve been written out of the fight before the showdown began. After placing several bullets into a man’s unarmored head, it became clear that shooting this bloke wasn’t the way MachineGames intended me to clear this encounter. The second was late in the story, where I thought, ‘There’s no point rolling credits with revolver rounds in the cylinder!’ and figured I’d quickly plug two Nazis that suddenly appeared ahead of me in an open elevator. They simply took too many shots to go down. It seems like a weird fumble, when the scene of Indy actually using his pistol and taking out the Raiders swordsman in a <em>single shot</em> is one of the most memorable moments in the whole film franchise. Revolver rounds should absolutely remain exceedingly rare, but the pistol itself really should have shipped with the consistent stopping power of its cinematic counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also rarely feels logical that high-ranking enemies within the levels can automatically see through disguises, particularly in Vatican City. It <em>is </em>a mechanic I’m accustomed to thanks to the likes of Hitman, which I’ll be clear is another game I love, but it’s definitely a little sillier here. It really is total nonsense that a random Italian officer would physically attack a stranger who is, for all intents and purposes, a visiting priest. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only a mild annoyance though and, to be fair, The Great Circle actually has a very smart approach to difficulty overall. There’s a lot more fiddling you can do than just adjust a single setting from easy to very hard. Enemy attributes are split into several categories, meaning you can tweak it so that there are tougher enemies, but fewer of them. Maybe you want to pump up their awareness, but make them weaker than wet newspapers. (This is something I think I may try for a second run.) It’s good that these options are here because, on regular difficulty, the stealth <em>is </em>quite basic; enemies have pretty limited vision and they’re easier to sneak past than I first assumed. I definitely became progressively less cautious once I realised I could sneak across seemingly dangerously open places as long as I did it fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, The Great Circle does allow us to return to previously visited locations to complete all the extra side missions, even after the main adventure is complete, so I may focus on that instead of starting over. I suspect I have many more hours of auxiliary objectives to keep me busy; I only got around to ticking off a handful of them on my first run through the story, which took me about 17 hours. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s based in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> IP and revolves around playing with friends in-person.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is made by a “small” development team within the company led by game director Dave Guskin and executive producer Chengran Chai. It’s not publishing the game itself; rather, it’s found a publishing partner in China for an initial launch there in early 2025. A global launch is planned, however, and Riot is on the hunt for a publishing partner for the U.S. and other countries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot said Project K is not a physical version of its existing digital collectible card game Legends of Luneterra, but "it does inherit some of the rich champion design philosophies of lore," and also benefits from art drawn from other League IP games. Riot added that it wants to create “a thriving community with a competitive ecosystem," and hopes for national and even global tournaments.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project K Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Project K appears to be Rune Battlegrounds, which was teased earlier this year by Riot’s team in China. A trailer showed off popular League characters such as Darius, Ahri, and Miss Fortune. At the time, Riot said it had no plans for a global release, but those plans have now changed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for League, which has just wrapped up Netflix animated show <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/arcane-league-of-legends">Arcane</a> with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arcane-season-2-act-iii-review-netflix-league-of-legends">Season 2</a>. As well as continued work on the hugely popular MOBA, League of Legends, it’s working on a League fighting game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a>, and has a digital card game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/legends-of-runeterra">Legends of Runeterra</a>. There’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/league-of-legends-mmorpg">League MMO</a> in the works, too, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riots-league-of-legends-mmo-is-being-reset-likely-going-dark-for-several-years">Riot has indicated it will be some time before it's ready to show it off</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>There is a new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) game is on the way. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown is a turn-based strategy game from developer Strange Scaffold, the team behind El Paso, Elsewhere, Clickolding, and I Am Your Beast.</p>



<p>The first turn-based TMNT game, Tactical Takedown follows what happens after both Splinter and Shredder pass away where a new leader has taken over the Foot Clan. The single-player game features 20 levels that are divided into campaigns that each focus on a single character. Each of the levels will also mutate as the turns pass.</p>



<p>Tactical Takedown features a graphic novel art style with figurines and diorama set pieces.  There will also be customizable movesets for each of the Turtles to shape the game how you’d like.</p>



<p>“This is the next step for Michelangelo, Donatello, Leonardo, and Raphael,” the game’s description reads. “…as the Turtles approach adulthood, they’re not just growing up… they’re growing apart.”</p>



<p>A release date will be announced at a later date, but it is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>, now.

            <p>
Eternal Strands, the fantasy action-RPG from former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has a release date - it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Game Pass on 28th January next year.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands follows the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, all this takes the form of an action-RPG inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> thrown in. The latter two games can be seen in the bosses roaming Eternal Strands' "open zone" world - 25-meter-high climbable creatures known as the Arks - and the way defeating them provides resources used to create new weapons and armour back at a base camp.

<p>
As for the Zelda influences, they come in the interplay between Brynn's magical abilities and the environment. Powers are built around flame, ice, and telekinetic force, all of which can be further enhanced in conjunction with the shifting temperatures caused by the world's unstable climate. "Heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat," explains the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">blurb over on Steam</a>. "Create [ice] bridges, burn barriers, or launch Brynn across the world. The next-generation physics system encourages and rewards player creativity in exploration as much as combat." Oh, and every surface is climbable too.
</p><p>
When Eternal Strands arrives on 28th January next year, it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It's also confirmed to be a day one Game Pass release for Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Additionally, as per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/4467103536898901921?l=english">FAQ on Steam</a>, free post-launch content is planned, and a demo's also on the way. Yellow Brick Games says more details on the latter will be shared at a "later date".

			<p>You know a character is iconic when millions of people name their pets after them, but there’s something so satisfying about Indiana Bones… I mean Jones, being named after a dog in the first place. It’s just so pleasingly cyclical. Video games also move in circles, and where Indy’s mystical archeological adventures provided the inspiration for Tomb Raider and Uncharted, we’re now completing the loop in a way with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Giant Circle Review –&nbsp;Puzzles and pugilism" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp32fr7JWOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Well, kind of, because MachineGames has clearly sought to stand apart from those series in a number of ways, some of which really help make Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feel more like an Indiana Jones’ cinematic adventures than a video game romp.</p>


<p>Set after Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy gets that adventuring itch after a break in at Marshall College brings him into very close contact with a Latin-speaking giant – a now posthumous appearance from the late great Tony Todd. Figuring out that it’s one of his own recently unearthed finds that has gone missing, he decides to ditch all his marking and classes yet again and hare off around the world following the one clue that he has found, replete with the iconic red line inching its way across a world map to the Vatican.</p>


<p>MachineGames has absolutely captured the look and feel of Indiana Jones, both with the general graphical style, but most particularly in the game’s cutscenes. Troy Baker as Indy puts in a shift mimicking Harrison Ford’s gruff mumbling and mannerisms, and there’s only maybe a dozen instances where I can hear Baker’s natural accent coming through instead. His companion through most of the story is Gina, the Italian journalist, whose backstory is gradually unpeeled, while there’s friends old and new in surprising places that will lend a hand in the race against Nazi archeologist Emmerich Voss.</p>
<p>Add to this the classic 1930s serial style (by way of the 80s), the exact right kind of comedic fight choreography, and the story’s race against time to stop some unknowably powerful artefacts from falling into fascist hands, and this feels every bit an Indiana Jones tale.</p>
<p>They’ve also done a great job of translating the tone and style of Indiana Jones as a character to the gameplay. One of the most intriguing decisions was to use a first-person view for the vast majority of the game. Whether you’re punching fascists, whipping and yanking down on high up pulleys, taking photos of artefacts, or setting light to ancient brush that’s blocking your way, you do so while looking out from Indy’s eyes.</p>

<p>Let’s come back to the Nazi punching, which Indy has always been famous for. This really is the main way that you’ll fight in this game, with actual gunplay generally discouraged by just how quickly you can end up dying. Fisticuffs are fast and ludicrously loud as you can batter most enemies into unconsciousness on standard difficulty, and even quicker if you grab highlighted impromptu weaponry from your surroundings. Higher difficulties will reward you mastering the block, counter and dodge, as well as using the whip to disarm or pull enemies in for a beatdown.</p>
<p>Stealth is an option here, though it’s often more of a prelude to a flurry of fists or sneaky takedown. It feels a little cumbersome, as enemies are both very sensitive to sound if you drop something or bump into objects and very quick to give up. It can be easy to get overwhelmed if you don’t pick your battles and isolate enemies, and at those times it might be tempting to pick up a gun or whip out Indy’s revolver. Ammo is so limited, though, and you can’t take that gun with you – you can, however, use it as a melee weapon when it runs out of ammo.</p>
<p>In fact, you’re constantly dropping things on the floor, whether it’s so you can pull out the camera or lighter, so you can interact with a switch or object, or just any time you clamber over a ledge, it feels like whatever you were holding will be left behind. It’s a shade annoying sometimes.</p>
<p>There are cuts away from first-person to a third-person camera in instances where it makes sense – essentially any time that you’re hanging from or sidling along a ledge, swinging across a gap, or squeezing through a gap in a wall. It’s a pretty sharp cut between views that manages not to be too jarring after the first couple instances, but these moments are generally so short that I do still wonder if the whole game couldn’t have played from the first-person. Certainly, Indy is a slow, grunty kind of manly man climber compared to Nathan Drake, and we’ve seen a number of games where short first-person climbing sections have worked fairly well. The gameplay heritage here, however, is The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher’s Bay.</p>

<p>But that first-person view compared to third-person helps to foster a more considered pace throughout the experience, hand in hand with the open locations at the Vatican, the Gizeh dig site and beyond. You’re in areas that are infested with guards, so even if you’re in disguise as a priest, it feels right to walk at a brisk pace and not sprint everywhere, even if you absolutely can without raising suspicion. Admittedly, by the time I got to Gizeh, I was running around like a madman, especially once I had found a guard’s uniform, only to be forced to take my time when boating through Sukhothai.</p>
<p>These handful of open locales evoke some of the slower moments from the films, where secrets and clues are hidden away in plain sight. With both the main story thread, significant side missions and more incidental puzzles and mysteries to unravel.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the puzzling throughout Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and the standard setting struck a good balance for me with not prompting too much with clues from Indy or companions talking. Of course there’s these implausibly old mechanisms hidden throughout the world that still, somehow, manage to just about work, if sometimes needing a little persuasion. These are also ancient tombs and temples where shafts of light just so happen to be in the right place when Indy finds hs way in, and there’s so many traps and things that he inadvertently triggers, with a few nice nods back to the films.</p>
<p>Each locale brings with it a new gadget to acquire and use, such as the camera that you use to gather information for the quest, which can be used to gain Adventure Points from snapping interesting views as you explore more generally, and that is all then fed into the character upgrade system, where you find and then spend those points on instructive books. Oh, and you can photograph the cats of the Vatican as well. Sadly there’s no petting the animals.</p>

<p>That camera and all the other clues you find end up wonderfully rendered in Jones’ notebook, filling out with all the details of the journey so far as you go. You don’t need to peel through it too often, outside of checking the mission log and map of an open area (which also briefly reveals a waypoint, if you don’t have those permanently enabled), but it’s nice to flip through the pages and details every once in a while.</p>
<p>On the whole, the game comes together beautifully well, each discovery, each plot beat pushing you on, wanting to see the next. but there are a few rough edges and moments that draw it back down. While it does fit the tone, stealth is undeniably awkward, climbing is slow and ponderous, and the fast beatdowns of ordinary guards become tiresome slugfests for the handful of what are effectively boss fights. The third location of Sukhothai also saps the pace by forcing you into a boat with a maze of waterways to navigate – this is a long game, especially if you do a lot of side tasks. There’s also just a few times where NPC animation and scripting is a bit clunky, which reminds you this is a game, even if not really affecting the experience.</p>
<p>Playing on PC, I felt that performance was generally great on my system – Ryzen 5900X and Radeon RX 6800. Outside of one graphical glitch that’s set to be fixed in a patch – &nbsp;temporary black boxes mainly in cutscenes caused by dynamic resolution scaling – the default High settings and dynamic resolution let me target 1440p with a resolute 60fps. The game still looks pretty great even when tuning things down to ‘Low’.</p>

			<p>Fans of Indiana Jones haven't exactly been swimming in great new entries for many years now. The adventure franchise was created by George Lucas in the eighties with three highly successful movies. Then, all those who loved the scruffy but charming professor of archaeology portrayed by Harrison Ford had to wait for nearly twenty years to get Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It wasn't until last year that another sequel, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was released. It featured Harrison Ford's final appearance, and the reception wasn't nearly as great as the previous installments.</p>
<p>Gamers have recently suffered from a similar dearth of new productions. Nine original Indiana Jones videogames were released between 1985 and 2009, but there's a fifteen-year gap between Staff of Kings and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Thankfully, Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout manager Todd Howard is a big fan of the character created by George Lucas. He has sought opportunities to make a game based on Indiana for a long time, pitching a project directly to Lucas himself back in 2009.</p>
<p>Back then, his idea did not take off due to a lack of resources on Bethesda's behalf. He kept trying, though, and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-great-circle-idea-for-the-indiana-jones-game-was-first-conceived-by-bethesdas-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his idea based around the so-called Great Circle</a> (which can be drawn on the world map by uniting the planet's most significant archaeological sites) took off. Howard selected Bethesda-owned developer MachineGames to make the game because of their familiarity with the World War II-adjacent setting and the main enemy, the Nazis. His perseverance is likely the primary reason we have this game now. Having just finished it, I am absolutely glad that it happened, as this might just be the best Indiana Jones game ever made.</p>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: yes, as you may have read, the game is almost exclusively played from a first-person view. This might seem counter-intuitive for two good reasons. First, when you have such a recognizable character as the protagonist, you would want to show him at all times. Second, the two main franchises in this sub-genre, Tomb Raider and Uncharted, have been massively successful with sticking to the third-person.</p>
<p>However, there are other considerations to make. MachineGames have always developed games played in first-person view, not just the Wolfenstein series, but even The Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness when they were still at Starbreeze. This choice allowed them to do what they know best, though they have added a few concessions. In specific instances, while traversing the maps, the perspective automatically switches to third-person because that's simply the most comfortable way to handle those situations. Moreover, unlike in Cyberpunk 2077 where even the cutscenes are played in first-person, you'll be able to see a relatively young Indiana in all his glory in this game's many cinematics. Beyond these principles, though, what matters is how it plays, and this plays extremely well. The first-person view undoubtedly maximizes the immersion factor and also lets you play more naturally with the environment, both during combat and exploration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle marks a large departure from the studio's pedigree. MachineGames always made shooter titles, and this is anything but. Yes, you do technically have a gun and you can even borrow rifles from defeated enemies, but the game highly incentivizes non-lethal ways to overcome foes. This is one of the main ways it differentiates itself from Tomb Raider and Uncharted. While the games by Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog do sometimes offer stealth options, they are usually confined to specific segments; for most of those titles, players must necessarily engage in extensive shootouts where Lara Croft and Nathan Drake mow down countless enemies, creating the so-called ludonarrative dissonance between the murderous gameplay and the narrative that tells us they are heroes.</p>
<p>This would be entirely out of character for someone like Indiana Jones. Sure, he's been known to fire a gun, but he is not a killer. As such, it is perfectly fitting that the best way to progress through the maps and solve the mysteries is through a mixture of stealth, ingenuity, and disguises. That's right, they've taken a cue from HITMAN, and our favorite professor of archaeology can acquire various disguises to blend in and enter environments where he would otherwise be attacked on sight. As HITMAN fans know, you'll still have to keep your distance from certain NPCs (Captains, in this case) who can spot Indiana through disguise.</p>
<p>Disguises aren't always easy to procure, though, so stealth remains the most common way to access areas controlled by Nazis. Here, MachineGames did not see fit to reinvent the wheel, adopting a fairly standard stealth system. When they spot you, a wheel starts to fill, making them more suspicious at a speed that is based on their distance. When the wheel is full, they go on full alert, calling for help from nearby allies.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn't winning any awards for its stealth AI. Throughout my playthrough, I've seen several times where the NPCs failed to be alerted when I knocked out one of their fellows not 15 meters away. However, I'm willing to cut the game some slack. Stealth AI is extremely hard to get right; it would be very easy to make it realistic to a degree where it becomes very punishing for players. The purpose of a game like this is to provide a fun experience, though not to be an accurate simulation, and to this degree, the game succeeds.</p>
<p>That's largely due to the great level design that enables many different approaches to the various situations. In this regard, the game reminded me of Dishonored, which placed a similar emphasis on stealth through its amazing level design. Like in those games, exploration is greatly rewarded. There's a ton of notes that not only fill out the lore but also provide maps and clues to solving the various mysteries and side stories that populate Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is especially notable in the three open maps: the Vatican, Gizeh, and Sukhothai. Here, players can explore largely at their leisure, uncovering artifacts and tombs and discovering adventure books and chests that help with progression. Indeed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has some RPG-lite elements. By completing main and side objectives as well as snapping pictures of key locations and subjects, the game awards Adventure Points, which can be used to unlock <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of upgrades</a> in the survival, fitness, packing, brawling, combat, and exploration categories.</p>
<p>You will need to obtain the related Adventure Book to unlock an upgrade, though, which is where exploring every nook and cranny becomes highly recommended. There are even secret underground boxing rings where Indiana faces off against up to three foes to earn money and buy more Adventure Books.</p>
<p>By the way, brawling is the main way to resolve combat, and it's well done. You can parry and dodge, as well as use the left trigger to hit with the left hand and the right trigger to hit with the right hand, which is a nuance that most games do not include. Hits are meaty, especially when you grab a shovel or baton to hit the Nazis with. Indiana is not a fighter, though, and at Hard difficulty, you won't want to get surrounded by too many foes - yet another reason to be stealthy.</p>
<p>The difficulty can be set separately for action and exploration, which is a win-win in my book. Every user deserves to tailor the experience to their liking. There are only two exploration options: Light and Moderate. The former lowers the difficulty of puzzles, but rest assured that at least some of the optional puzzles remain not at all obvious. The game even includes a few instances where you'll have to crack a safe code by cross-referencing various tables. Of course, as with Tomb Raider and Uncharted, there are also many enjoyable environmental puzzles, most of which are resolved with the help of Indiana's trusty whip.</p>

<p>Being a game based on a movie character, the story is clearly very important for this game. Thankfully, this is one of the most exciting Indiana Jones stories yet. It is set in 1937, between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, while the winds of war start gathering across the world. The characters are extremely well portrayed, especially Gina Lombardi (played by a fantastic Alessandra Mastronardi), and more importantly, Troy Baker does an excellent job (despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-initially-didnt-want-troy-baker-playing-indiana-jones-in-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Howard's initial reservations</a>) at mimicking Harrison Ford's voice without being too on the nose. The antagonist Emmerich Voss is a Nazi through and through, which makes him inherently stereotypical as far as villains go, although he does have more interests than just pleasing the Fatherland - he wants to best Indiana and prove he's the finest archaeologist of the two.</p>
<p>Be prepared for the plot to take a bit of a supernatural turn, but then again, it's not unusual within this franchise and genre. Overall, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has a lot of great content; I finished it in 23 hours, and I had to rush for the review, leaving some optional mysteries aside. The side stories tie in well with the main narrative, and you can return to the aforementioned three maps even after the game's ending, which will make completionists very happy.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is largely great, with the excellent lighting and facial animations being standouts. Powered by the id Tech engine, it is the first game with built-in ray tracing. Unfortunately, path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction will not be available until day one (December 9), so I could not test it. However, the performance at the current max settings allows a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RTX 4090 to use NVIDIA DLAA while keeping a comfortable and smooth 70-80 frames per second. Stutters were few, usually only appearing briefly during the automatic saves. By the way, you can enable real-time performance analytics in the game settings, at least on PC. Moreover, the game already offers full support for the DualSense controller on PC, coming with all prompts. Of course, there's no haptic feedback or adaptive triggers, as those are likely still being tuned for the PS5 release next Spring.</p>
<p>There are also a few bugs that I have to report on the technical side. Firstly, there's a visual noise bug that showed itself consistently throughout the game. I'm told it is an issue caused by the combined usage of DLSS and HDR and that it will be fixed with a patch shortly. Secondly, for the whole playthrough, I had to contend with a bug where the game would dramatically slow down the frame rate after taking a picture with Indiana's camera, loading a save, or starting a cutscene. I quickly found out a workaround - alt-tabbing and returning to the game completely fixed it, at least until one of the above happened again. I have reported the issue and sincerely hope it will be resolved soon, as it was quite annoying.</p>
