                <p>Bandai Namco Entertainment and From Software have just released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and are already teasing its first post-launch update. Patch 1.02 is scheduled to release sometime next week and will improve the solo experience of playing this co-op game.</p><p>"Next week, Patch 1.02 will be released, and will include several bug fixes as well as improvements for solo expeditions," the official <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436889293345246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring account on X</a> explained. While the full patch notes won't be released until next week, the account did tease some important updates coming to solo expeditions in Nightreign. After Patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once per night-boss battle and gain more runes (a form of in-game currency) while playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>  — ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nightreign remixes the critically acclaimed 2022 game from Dark Souls creator From Software into a more multiplayer-focused experience where players take on tough bosses together. That said, players also have the option of going on these expeditions alone if they really want to, although even GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> admits that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." After Patch 1.2, Nightreign should feel more welcoming to those solo players.</p><p>The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-players-warned-of-pc-performance-issues-in-day-one-patch-notes/1100-6531903/" data-ref-id="1100-6531903">received a day-one patch</a> that implemented some last-minute balance adjustments and warned of PC performance problems. It's currently unknown if Patch 1.02 will fix any of those performance issues. None of these balance, PC performance, or solo play issues have prevented Nightreign from becoming an instant success, though. It has already been confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928451382111052101" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million people</a> have played Elden Ring Nightreign on its first day.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>That's an impressive feat for any game, but not all that surprising for a spin-off of the uber-popular <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/28/elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-shipped">surpassed 30 million copies shipped</a> last month. Despite featuring "Elden Ring" in the title, Nightreign differs from its predecessor. Instead of a single-player action-RPG focused on exploration, mystery, and overcoming challenges, Nightreign is a three-player co-op roguelite spin on Elden Ring about min-maxing efficiency in each run.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pRhcXR-1SeY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>It's a great time, and you can read about why in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency"><em>Game Informer's</em> Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.

			<p><span>FromSoftware has just&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its new game, Elden Ring Nightreign, has already registered over two million players on its launch day. On Steam, it has peaked at 313K concurrent players, and it could certainly get higher during the weekend.</span></p>
<p>On one hand, this is entirely unsurprising since it's the spin-off of a game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-sales-top-30-million-units-after-3-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over 30 million copies to date (and is now getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-rumored-a24-elden-ring-movie-with-alex-garland-writing-and-directing-is-reportedly-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movie</a>, too). On the other hand, Nightreign is inevitably an experiment to some degree, and its formula wasn't exactly guaranteed to be equally attractive. Indeed, critic scores were a bit lower than usual for the Japanese studio. However, our Francesco De Meo still enjoyed his time with the game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his 9/10 review</a> published earlier this week:</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</em></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/676805/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fromsoftware-elden-ring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Imagine playing <em>Fortnite</em>, but instead of fighting other players, all you want to do is break into houses to look for caches of slurp juice. Yes, the storm is closing in on you, and there’s a bunch of enemies waiting to kill you, but all you want to do is take a walking tour of Tilted Towers. Then when the match is over, instead of queueing again, you start reading the in-game lore for Peely and Sabrina Carpenter. You can count your number of player kills on one hand meanwhile your number of deaths is in the hundreds. You’ve never achieved a victory royale, but you’ve never had more fun.</p><p><em>Nightreign</em> is FromSoftware’s first <em>Elden Ring</em> spinoff, and it’s unlike any <em>Souls</em> game that the developer has done before. <em>Nightreign</em> has the conceit of so many battle royale games — multiplayer combat focused on acquiring resources across a large map that slowly shrinks over time — wrapped in the narrative, visual aesthetics, and combat of <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of the Tarnished, you are a Nightfarer. Instead of the expansive Lands Between, you are sent to Limveld, an island with an ever-shifting landscape. And instead of becoming the Elden Lord, your goal is to defeat the Night Lord and end the destructive storm that scours the land.</p><p><sub>Elden Ring Nightreign<em> aura-farming exhibit A.</em></sub></p><p>In <em>Nightreign</em>, gameplay sessions are broken up into expeditions, each of which is divided into three day-night cycles. During the day, you — either solo or with two other players — explore the world looking for weapon upgrades and fighting bosses for the enhancements they reward. You’ll be forced to move as the deadly Night’s Tide slowly consumes the map, whittling your health to nothing if you’re caught in it. When the map is at its smallest, you face a tough midboss. Defeat it to commence day two of the expedition or die and start it all over. Then, on the third day, you face the expedition’s final boss. There are several expeditions to conquer each with different bosses, mid-bosses, weapons to collect, and all kinds of events that make each run unique.</p><p>I had the opportunity to play <em>Nightreign</em> once before earlier this year (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">and during a more recent network test</a>) , and it wasn’t the best preview, as the game was plagued with all kinds of issues that didn’t allow me to experience it the way the developers intended. Those technical issues have been ironed out but I still haven’t completed the game’s most basic objective: beat the first expedition. This isn’t because of any technical or gameplay issues I had. For the times I wanted to play as intended, my colleague Jay Peters stepped in to help me and I had no problem finding party members to tackle expeditions with on my own… I just never really wanted to. And part of the reason why I’m enjoying <em>Nightreign</em> so much is because the game lets me play it in a way that’s completely counterintuitive – slowly and alone.</p><p>Collaborative gaming doesn’t always feel good to me. I want to take things at my own pace, and that’s hard to do when there’s a group of people frustrated with me because they need my help to kill a boss while I’m still delving into a dungeon a mile away. But the ability to solo queue does come with a significant catch – you’re not gonna get very far. I died <em>often </em>and to everything from random enemies to bosses. It’s not often that I even make it to that first boss fight without dying to the warm-up battles that precede it. This <em>should </em>frustrate me, but I don’t care in the slightest. I’m just so pleased that I can go at my own pace to explore more of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s visually gorgeous and narratively sumptuous world.</p><p>Which brings me to my favorite part: its characters. <em>Nightreign</em> has eight new classes, each with their own unique abilities. The classes can still use every weapon you find (with some locked behind level requirements) so there’s an option to tailor a character to fit your playstyle. There are certain kinds of classes I gravitate toward, specifically ranged combat, but for the first time in a class-based game, I love every one of them. It is so much fun shredding enemies to ribbons with the Duchess, using her Restage ability to replay the attacks done to an enemy essentially doubling the damage they receive. I love the Raider’s powers of just being a big fuckin’ dude, slamming things with big ass great weapons. And true to my ranged combat loving heart, Ironeye’s specialty with bows makes it so nice when I wanna kill things without putting myself in danger.</p><p>Then there’s the Guardian. Look at him. He’s a giant armored bird-person with the busted wing and the huge-ass halberd and shield. His story involves being a protector who failed his flock and has found a new one in the other Nightfarers. I fell to my knees reading one of his codex entries and seeing how the Recluse, the mage character, helped him with his damaged wing. Every character has a codex that updates with their personal story the more expeditions you attempt. This is the shit I get out of bed for. </p><p>I thought I was going to hate the concept of <em>Nightreign</em>. I want more E<em>lden Ring</em>: I love that world, so any chance I can have to go back, I’ll take but… I just don’t like multiplayer games. Describing <em>Nightreign</em> makes it sound like the reason why it exists is because an out of touch CEO looked at the popularity of <em>Elden Ring</em> and at all the money <em>Fortnite</em> prints and went “Yeah, let’s do that.” Even if that’s the case, <em>Nightreign</em> has been constructed so that it still appeals to lore freaks like me and I can ignore the less savory bits around multiplayer with relative ease. </p><p>If I can take a moment and borrow a pair of words from my Gen Z niblings to describe <em>Nightreign</em> it’d be “aura” and “aura farming.” Aura is used to describe a person’s general coolness or badassery while aura farming is the activities one can engage in to increase one’s aura. John Wick has aura. In the first movie, when he performs his monologue about getting back in the assassin business spitting and screaming – that’s aura farming.</p><p>And between the cooperative nature of the game, its rapid-paced combat, and the new characters, abilities, and story, <em>Elden Ring</em> Nightreign has a ton of aura that I’m having a lot of fun farming – just not in the way I expected.</p><p><sub><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest release from the <em>Dark Souls</em> team immediately sprang up the Steam charts to reach over 300,000 concurrent players. That made it the fourth-biggest game on Valve’s storefront and the second-biggest FromSoftware launch on PC behind <em>Elden Ring</em>. Its namesake and its $40 price point clearly did the experimental multiplayer spin-off some favors. </p><p>But it didn’t take players long to realize that <em>Nightreign</em> is very much not <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its slow, plodding predecessor, the spin-off is a battle royale-influenced loot race in which sessions see an entire Soulsborne experience condensed into just 45 minutes. It takes some getting used to, and players are already coming to grips with <em>Nightreign</em>’s notable hostility to explaining itself, even for a FromSoftware game. And while it does allow for offline solo play, its steep difficulty curve—more of a right angle really—heavily rewards group play and coordination. </p><p>“If you don’t have 2 other friends to play with in voice chat, don’t waste your time,” wrote Steam user Hishamm. “Game is <em>Elden Ring</em>, but 3p, and the solo queue is abysmal.” “Gameplay itself seems fun but I can’t possible leave a positive review if a game released in 2025 has no way to communicate in a coop game (neither voice nor text chat),” wrote Lynni. “Impossible to make progress without voice chat,” wrote Vahit Horoz. “If you have 3 friends you can talk to and play regularly, you will have a great time, the connection is smooth, the map is full of events and the game loop is very interesting.”</p><p>The game currently has a Steam rating of 65 percent, making it the lowest-scored FromSoftware release on the platform outside of <em>Dark Souls III</em>’s <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC. The reviews are full of complaints about the lack of duos (you have to either play alone or with a three-stack) and how matchmaking with strangers often leads to people randomly running around the map without coordinating, a task made harder by the lack of communication tools outside of pings and emotes. I think that might even out in the days and weeks ahead as players learn the basics of the randomized<em> Nightreign</em> map and how much more efficient you are together than split up, but the lack of modern multiplayer features is a real issue. </p><figure id="" data-id="193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-recommend-id="image://193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-format="png" data-width="2256" data-height="888" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Elden Ring Nightreign reviews.

Nightlord bosses are practically impossible at the moment for all but the most experienced and hardcore <em>Elden Ring</em> loners. A mysterious day-one patch alluded to balance changes and other improvements, but didn’t spell out exactly what those changes are. If FromSoftware does decide to dial things back a bit, it wouldn’t be the first time it’s made one of its games easier. The studio quickly made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a></span> much easier when it kicked everyone’s ass last summer.

		<p>This is it. The last week without a Switch 2. I am actually incredibly hyped – way more than I have been for the past couple of console launches – and I think it’s because of one thing: Mario Kart World. We’ve basically been playing the same Mario Kart game for 11 years. Yes… 11! Don’t get me wrong, those have been some great years, and Mario Kart 8 has been tweaked, updated and added to across that time, so it’s not the same game. But… it is the same game. Mario Kart World is a totally new take on Mario’s kart racing franchise, and I can’t wait to check it out.</p>
<p>The other nice thing is that there are fewer launch games for me to pick up here. I’m always an idiot and buy too many things at launch, and then none of them get played properly, but there’s a small batch that I’m interested in, having played other games elsewhere. I do wonder how that will play out for third parties, and whether they’ll see the return they’re hoping for with legacy titles, but here’s hoping it doesn’t put them off from bringing more Switch 2 games to the table.</p>
<p>This week, I’ve been playing a few things, going from Doom: The Dark Ages to a bunch of different sized wheels in Warhammer 40,000 Speedfreeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">Roadcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/f1-25-review/">F1 25</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing Chains of Freedom for review, Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, and Oblivion.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been probably been playing Destiny 2 this week, but he’s also been writing about a batch of other things that he’s going to tell you about, including Hell is Us, which he seems rather taken with. You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/hands-on-hell-is-us-preview/">read his preview right here</a>.</p>

<p>After jetting off to Madeira for most of the week, <strong>Aran’s</strong> gaming was limited to starting Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon for review. He says, “So far I have escaped a dungeon and killed a miniboss found in a hidden dungeon in a blood-filled lake.” Sounds delightful!</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been playing Hypercharge: Unboxed but says it is “more fun in concept than it is in execution”, calling it, “A pretty by-the-numbers arcade shooter that’s fun for a short while”.</p>
<p>That’s not all he’s had on the go though, as he tell us, “After chipping away at it for a couple of weeks, I also crossed Resident Evil 8 off my backlog. I really enjoyed the setting and many of the smart refinements Capcom has made to the series’ new formula. Presenting players with a cast of twisted villains, then tasking us with taking them down works great just as it did in Resi 7. However, much like its predecessor, there’s a jarring theme shift between atmospheric horror and sci-fi that I wasn’t a huge fan of.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been carrying on this week. Specifically with&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is “a great RPG with memorable characters, an engaging story, and superb combat but irritating platforming sections” and continued to enjoy Revenge of the Savage Planet in co-op with his partner.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been Revenging that Savage Planet, saying, “It works really well in the transition to third person”. He’s also rinsed Doom the Dark Ages, telling us, “It was a fun campaign but the pacing felt off in places. I’ve had the chance to try out a few demos early with previews on the way and really enjoyed Near Mage – review up soon. Finally as a result of the early demos I’ve been trying to beat the NES Ninja Gaiden games and my God they’re tough. Resisted save state scumming so far but don’t think that’ll last much longer.”</p>
<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been doing some prep work for the impending arrival of the Switch 2 next week. That’s meant going all the way back to the PS4 to capture some Yakuza 0, Cyberpunk 2077, Kunitsu-Gami and more for comparisons – Cyberpunk on PS4 is such a rough time… He’s also dipped into the Splitgate 2 open beta, which is a pretty good time while everyone’s still figuring out how to best use portals, jet packs and everything else.</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>

			<p>We've heard next to nothing about the Splinter Cell Remake since Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/">confirmed the remake was coming</a> after years of waiting for Ubisoft to even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-ceo-were-working-on-splinter-cell-comeback/">say that they are bringing the series back</a>.</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">a sly comment</a> from the managing director at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio that's leading development on the Splinter Cell Remake, amounted to Ubisoft saying they had nothing to say at the time. That was the last time we heard anything directly from Ubisoft about the coming remake.</p>
<p>Today, however, Splinter Cell was brought up again, through the company's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1928421132438224990">account on X</a>. The post is just a photo of Sam Fisher, not from the original 2002 game, but from 2005's Chaos Theory, captioned with emoticons making a face and a Splinter Cell hashtag.</p>
<p>The image's alt-text reads "<em><span>Close-up of Sam Fisher from Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, showing a stern expression with focused eyes, short dark hair, and a rugged beard, set against a blurred high-tech background. He's locked in.</span></em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Summer Game Fest is around the corner, and interestingly, Ubisoft is not included in the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">image showcasing the partners for this year's show</a>. Keighley also claimed that this year's show has 60+ partners, but the image and the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/">website</a> only list 57. This was likely purposeful, for Ubisoft to announce its involvement in Summer Game Fest separately with a yet-to-be-announced Ubisoft Forward event sometime during the SGF weekend.</p>
<p>That's all just speculation, but with how vocal Splinter Cell fans have been about asking for a return of the series, the company has to be acutely aware of the impact even mentioning Splinter Cell has. It's not likely that Sam Fisher would show up a week ahead of SGF if Ubisoft didn't have something to show regarding the Splinter Cell Remake.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get an announcement soon that Ubisoft does have something Splinter Cell Remake-related to show.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nine-sols-sales-top-800k-developer-red-candle-reveals.1202694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nine-sols-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Red Candle Games has revealed that Metroidvania action platformer&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has reached a big sales milestone, with the game also celebrating its first anniversary.</p>

<p>Released on May 29th last year,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has, according to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1809540/view/544484746860692250" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, reached 800,000 copies since its launch. That number counts across all platforms, too, so it includes not only the game's initial PC release, but also November's console ports.</p>

<p>Red Candle also includes a timeline of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' achievements in the post, revealing that by the six-week mark, the game had reached 6,000 Steam reviews and earned itself an Overwhelmingly Positive rating (which, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all reviews</a>, it still holds at time of writing).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=knOIaziU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-sales-800k-explosion.jpg?itok=ya2byuep 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell 800,000 copies across all platforms since launching last year.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, it's a 2D action platformer with heavy Metroidvania elements created by Taiwanese studio Red Candle Games, best known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devotion-removed-from-steam-amid-outcry-over-winnie-pooh-reference" rel="nofollow">controversial</a>&nbsp;horror adventure game&nbsp;<em>Devotion</em>.</p>

<p>The game revolves around Yi, who must seek out the titular nine Sols in order to take their Sol Seals. His true motivations are unclear at the outset of the game, but become clearer as the plot progresses.</p>

<p>Yi also befriends a young human child by the name of Shuanshuan at the start of&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>, and it's his relationship with Shuanshuan that informs his character development and reveals more about the world in which the game takes place.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>is a Metroidvania, that might not be the best attitude with which to approach it; you can think of it more as a semi-linear platformer that takes influence from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow">Sekiro</a>&nbsp;</em>than as a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a>-style sprawling and interconnected experience.</p>

<p>Nightreign released earlier today and has already seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">strong numbers of concurrent players on Steam</a>, although it's received a Mixed reception due to players criticising the lack of duo option and in-game communication features.</p>
<p>Indeed, many players have criticised the studio - known for its single-player games - for creating a multiplayer game, although solo play is an option.</p>

<p>As I wrote earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">I would not recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play.</p>
<p>However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible.</p>
<p>The studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Koei Tecmo's only Nintendo Switch 2 launch game is NOBUNAGA’S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition, an improved version of the game that launched in July 2023 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. Awakening was the sixteenth installment in the popular series of turn-based grand strategy games. Ahead of that game's launch, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-preview-and-qa-with-director-ryu-michi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an interview with Koei Tecmo's producer and director Michi Ryu.</p>
<p>The Complete Edition (which will also be available on Sony's PlayStation 5 console) features DLC from the original title as well as six new scenarios along with climactic Decisive Battles. Players will be able to launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies while experiencing life as a daimyo in the troubled times of the Warring States Period (16th-century Japan).</p>
<p>With the game's debut scheduled for next week, we contacted Michi Ryu once again to discuss specifically the Nintendo Switch 2 version of NOBUNAGA’S&nbsp; AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition. The game will be available on June 5 as part of the Switch 2's launch lineup.</p>
<p><iframe title="NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvZG8Jiz7oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you first receive your Nintendo Switch 2 development kit?</strong></p>
<p>I can't give you a concrete answer, so I'll leave it to your imagination (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>How long has this version been in development, and what do you think about the new platform's ease of development?</strong></p>
<p>While I can't disclose the exact timeframe, we had previously released the Nintendo Switch version, so porting to Nintendo Switch 2 was possible to achieve within a small team in a short period.&nbsp; Besides the porting, we have also worked on adding new hardware features and preparing game content updates, so overall, it took a considerable amount of time. Developing on this new platform feels the same as the Switch, which makes the process easier. However, there are always some challenges when launching a game (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>The platform has evolved in many ways. There are many interesting aspects, but in terms of strategy games, the possibility of being able to use the Joy-Con 2 as a mouse might be the most notable one. Although we think that using the controller to play is more than enough, it's undeniable that a mouse, which allows more intuitive control, is better suited for this genre. Being able to accomplish this through hardware features is a significant advantage.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of raw computing power, is it closer to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox Series S?</strong></p>
<p>Since the "NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION" series is not available on Xbox, we cannot make a comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution for NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition? Is it essentially the same as DLSS SR on PC?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using DLSS.</p>
<p><strong>What resolution and frame rate options are you offering for the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>The game runs at Full HD and 30fps. We also experimented with 4K and 60fps, but the power required to render the Japanese archipelago with these graphics is more than you can imagine and difficult to keep stable, so we had to give up. We hope to revisit this challenge in the future if the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening&nbsp;was previously launched on the first Switch. What kind of improvements can players expect in the Switch 2 version?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the hardware evolution of Switch 2, the graphics have been significantly improved. Elements like the sea, sky, and ground look much more real, enhancing the immersive experience of the game. Being able to have this level of graphics in a portable format is a major point to be enjoyed by players. Additionally, with mouse operation via Joy-Con 2 and USB mouse support, intuitive controls are now possible. We have also included some game content that was previously only available in Asia, so we hope players will enjoy those as well.</p>
<p><strong>Is the experience of playing with the controller as a mouse similar to using the mouse on PC? What are the differences, if any?</strong></p>
<p>The mouse controls have been closely recreated. Although there are some differences between the hardware, such as assigning the mouse wheel to the stick, the functionality has been covered.<br>
Moreover, shortcuts have been assigned to the other Joy-Con 2, so the overall functionality might even surpass that of using a mouse alone.</p>
<p><strong>Are you taking advantage of the improved HD Rumble in NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening Complete Edition?</strong></p>
<p>HD Rumble is not supported.</p>
<p><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about the Switch 2 version of your game?</strong></p>
<p>The Nobunaga's Ambition series is a title that is a traditional Japanese game with a long history of over 40 years. This is the first time in the series that we are releasing a complete edition, and it's thanks to the positive reception of the latest title (NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION: Awakening) and its steady sales. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has played it. And if you haven't tried it yet, I hope you'll take this chance to pick it up and try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-switch-era-took-pok%C3%A9mon-collecting-to-the-next-level.1202631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/675590/nintendo-switch-pokemon-home-legends-za-generation-x<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the first Nintendo Switch era of <em>Pokémon </em>games was undeniably rocky at times, it brought the series’ trading and organization systems into a new level of maturity. It wasn’t always <em>easy </em>to complete Pokédexes in remakes like <em>Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em> and new entries like <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. But those games helped The Pokémon Company create a more seamless way to move your monsters from one title to another, or swap them with friends. And with the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise about to make its big debut on the Switch 2 with the cross-generation game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, it feels like The Pokémon Company is getting ready to take the trading system to the next level.</p><p>In the <em>Pokémon </em>games, filling up your Pokédex has always been an exercise in patience, planning, and understanding that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company want you trading with other players rather than trying to catch ’em all on your own. The games’ trading mechanics evolved as the series jumped from the Game Boy to new hardware. By Generation IV (the DS games), players could swap monsters remotely over the internet without needing to use wired link cables. And after years of many legendary and mythical pokémon only being obtainable through in-person events, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak used <em>Pokémon</em>’s Generation V to introduce a serial code redemption system that made snagging super-rare monsters infinitely easier.</p><p>Bringing pokémon you first caught on older titles like the GBA’s <em>Pokémon Emerald</em> up to more modern ones like the 3DS’s <em>Ultra Sun</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/12/how-to-trade-pokemon-between-every-generation">was still a very tedious process</a>. But with each generation of games, The Pokémon Company was clearly building out a digital system that allowed players to experience their <em>Pokémon </em>adventures as one massive, continuous journey. That project continued in the Switch era with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18089644/pokemon-lets-go-new-players-kids-nintendo-switch">2018’s <em>Let’s Go </em>games</a>, 3D remakes of <em>Pokémon Yellow </em>that featured new mechanics inspired by <em>Pokémon Go</em>.</p><div><p>It was wild to see Nintendo using a console title to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17963926/pokemon-lets-go-nintendo-switch-pikachu-evee">capitalize on the success of a mobile application</a>. But the way the <em>Let’s Go </em>games connected with <em>Pokémon Go</em> and the Pokémon Home cloud storage service spoke volumes about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17963926/pokemon-lets-go-nintendo-switch-pikachu-evee">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s vision for the franchise’s future</a>. </p></div><p>Like the 3DS’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/4/4693376/pokemon-bank-cloud-storage-service">Pokémon Bank</a> and Poké Transporter companion applications, Pokémon Home gave players an online space to stash their ’mons and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">a way to move them between games</a>. Home’s ability to connect with Bank made it useful for longtime fans looking to keep their favorite monsters with them. But the application was also clearly meant to help newer players — people drawn to the franchise by games like <em>Scarlet / Violet </em>and <em>Legends: Arceus</em> — start building collections that would keep them invested (both emotionally and financially) in the series.</p><p>By requiring subscriptions, Pokémon Home and the Switch <em>Pokémon </em>games’ online features helped Nintendo come into its own as a services company. Since Nintendo Switch Online’s launch in 2018, Nintendo has sweetened the deal by gradually adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24339906/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-nso">more of its classic games to the service</a>, along with other features, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">a streaming music app</a>. It’s been a little frustrating to watch the company choose not to put most of its older pre-DS <em>Pokémon </em>games online. But much like Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s tradition of making it impossible to complete the Pokédex without having access to both versions (e.g., <em>Red </em>/ <em>Blue</em>) of the same game, this has felt like a calculated movie on the company’s part to keep players thinking about spending more money.</p><p>Especially with <em>Pokémon Go </em>and the various Switch remakes in the mix, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company built out an ecosystem of modern games that give players a way to catch virtually every single one of the franchise’s creatures. And while none of the past Switch games have been focused on cataloging <em>all </em>the pokémon, that feels like something that could change as <em>Pokémon </em>moves to the Switch 2. </p><p>Like <em>Arceus </em>before it, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>(a Switch game that’s also getting a Switch 2 edition) will likely feature a limited selection of ’mons in order to put more focus on new gameplay mechanics and a fresh story. But as the Switch 2 becomes Nintendo’s flagship platform, we could and arguably should see the <em>Pokémon </em>series evolve in some surprising ways. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks like a significant upgrade from <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em>, but the franchise’s potential to change more radically feels like something Nintendo has to be thinking about as it prepares for the next generation of mainline (rather than spinoff) games developed specifically for the Switch 2.</p><p>Something as simple as bringing the classic games to NSO with Pokémon Home compatibility would make buying into the larger ecosystem with its various subscriptions a much more interesting prospect. It would be a huge win for Pokéfans still hanging out on the original Switch, and it would make upgrading to the Switch 2 feel even more like following the franchise into the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That said, Summer Game Fest is just around the corner and Arrowhead used host Geoff Keighley’s last big gaming showcase to announce the addition of the Illuminate to the fray. Who knows what’s in store for the second half of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s second year?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a statement shared on social media, the studio stated it has "felt the knock-on effects" of recent changes in the industry and so, "after exploring every possible avenue" it has made "the incredibly heartbreaking decision to say goodbye to some truly brilliant members of the Playtonic team".</p>

<p>"This isn't a reflection of anyone's talent or dedication, the people leaving have poured so much heart, creativity, and care into everything we do. They've helped shape our studio, our games, and our culture, and we're incredibly proud of what we've built together."</p>
<p>The studio surmised: "This isn't simply a difficult moment, it's a period of profound change in how games are created and financed. The landscape is shifting, and with it, so must we."</p>

			<p>Two days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">Yuri Lowenthal confirmed in a post on BlueSky</a> that he wouldn't be returning to reprise his role as Yosuke in the Persona 4 Remake, a project that had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">rumored</a> to be happening, but not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>Lowenthal's claims that he potentially "<em>begged</em>" to be asked back and the fact that he deleted his original post made it look like Lowenthal had gone rogue, confirming his absence from the game as a small rebellious act against Atlus and SEGA.</p>
<p>But then a second actor, Erin Fitzgerald, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-wont-see-the-return-of-another-beloved-voice-actress/">confirmed her absence from the Persona 4 Remake</a> in a similar manner. Again, posting on BlueSky, Fitzgerald said, "<em>For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake. RIP. I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her.</em>"</p>
<p>And now today, for a third day in a row, another Persona 4 voice actor has come out on social media to say that they will not reprise their role in the Persona 4 Remake. This time, it's Amanda Winn Lee, the only difference this time is that <a href="https://x.com/amandawinnlee/status/1928242559685472293">she posted the news on X</a> instead of BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em><span>Since, I've had several people ask me: No, I wasn't asked to voice Yukiko in the P4 remake</span></em>."</p>
<p>The first time, it seemed like Lowenthal had gone rogue. Fitzgerald's post then opened up the possibility that the cast are all voicing their displeasure about not being asked back for the remake. That could still be true, but now that a third actor has come out and made the same claim, for a third day in a row, for a game that's not even officially confirmed, it's starting to feel like a marketing ploy ahead of the game's reveal, most likely next week during <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest.</a></p>
<p>A user on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oscarexplosion.bsky.social/post/3lqefs2747226">BlueSky</a> also cleverly noticed that the order of these announcements also matches the order the characters each of these actors play are added to your party in Persona 4. If Matt Mercer is next to say that they weren't asked back to voice Kanji Tatsumi, with the same wording, then this has almost certainly all been a marketing ploy to build up awareness of the upcoming remake ahead of its official reveal.</p>
<p>The twist is probably that it's not called Persona 4 Remake, with the word 'Remake' swapped for something else, similarly to how the remake of Persona 3 was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and that instead of recasting everyone, the whole voice cast is indeed returning for whatever the remake is actually called.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer Playtonic has officially confirmed that it's been hit by layoffs, describing those who have been let go as "some truly brilliant members of [the developer's] team".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1928429175062265999" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Playtonic says that although it explored "every possible avenue" to avoid layoffs, it was forced to make the same "painful decisions" that many other studios across the industry are currently facing.</p>

<p>The developer says the layoffs are not a "reflection of anyone's talent or dedication", but that "the landscape is shifting", forcing Playtonic to adapt to changing times. The company doesn't reveal how many staffers have lost their jobs.</p>

<p>What is for certain is that Playtonic is far from the only studio to be hit by layoffs in recent months. Big studios like&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>&nbsp;publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-leamington-closure" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, EA subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a>, and British outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">Sumo Group</a>&nbsp;have all been caught up in the industry sea change Playtonic identified.</p>

<p>Since forming in 2014, Playtonic has released just two games, namely 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>and its 2.5D spinoff&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</em>. It's currently working on a remaster-slash-remake of its first game with the rather amusing title&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to its development division, the studio also has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-partners-publishing-label-announced" rel="nofollow">publishing arm</a>&nbsp;by the name of Playtonic Friends, under which games like&nbsp;<em>BPM: Bullets Per Minute</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lil Gator Game</em>, and cozy farming sim&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cattle-country" rel="nofollow">Cattle Country</a>&nbsp;</em>have been released.</p>

The game is currently set for release sometime this year, so stay tuned for more.</p>
