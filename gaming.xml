<p>VALORANT coach Christine “potter” Chi has signed a three-year contract extension with Evil Geniuses. With the deal signed, potter will be under contract with Evil Geniuses through at least the 2027 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses has officially completed its roster in the final days of 2024, gearing up for the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season in the Americas league.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-evil-geniuses-seek-return-to-championship-glory">Evil Geniuses Seek Return to Championship Glory</h2>



<p>Potter signed a three-year, “max-length” contract with Evil Geniuses through 2027. The only other coach in VCT Americas with a contract through 2027, per <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRmmWiBmMMD43m5VtZq54nKlmj0ZtythsA1qCpegwx-iRptx2HEsG0T3cQlG1r2AIiKxBWnaurJZQ9Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Global Contract Database</a>, is 100 Thieves’ Anthony “Zikz” Gray. Zikz, a long-time coach in League of Legends who switched to VALORANT, was potter’s assistant coach during EG’s unexpected world championship run in 2023. The assistant coach for EG last year, Mike “pho” Panza, has also returned for the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Evil Geniuses CEO Chris DeAppolonio, in a press release today, called potter the “lynchpin” of EG’s VALORANT program, . “There’s no one else I’d want at the helm. With Potter’s leadership and passion, EG will always contend for the VALORANT World Championship.”</p>



<p>The re-signing of potter completes EG’s offseason ahead of the start of the 2025 season. The team opted to re-sign returning players Derrek “Derrek” Ha, Nicholas “NaturE” Garrison and Phat “Supamen” Le. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/">Two new additions in Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker and Jacob “icy” Lange</a> were announced Friday. Excluding icy, who was on the team’s reserve roster at the time, potter is the only remaining name from the 2023 Champions roster.</p>



<p>The full field of 12 teams in VCT Americas all made changes to their starting rosters during this offseason period.</p>



<p>How do you think potter and Evil Geniuses stack up against other VALORANT teams heading into VCT 2025? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The game has already picked up over 20 million players and shows no signs of stopping. Which is cool but also very surprising!</p><p>I think I speak for many of us when I ask: Weren’t we done with hero shooters? After the market was saturated with them and <em>Overwatch 2</em> turned out to be a slow-moving train wreck, it felt like the trend of having a colorful roster of heroes shoot each other over moving a payload was done. <em>Concord</em>, Sony’s failed hero shooter, seemed to really cement that when it launched and died in just about 4 weeks earlier this year. And yet, here we all are playing and loving <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, a free-to-play hero shooter with a big roster and plenty of payloads to move. Life is funny sometimes, huh?</p><p>Because <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is such a big hit, with many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> playing it, we’ve also been thinking about it a lot and writing up guides, stories, and other posts about it. So here’s everything we’ve written about <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in 2024 in one handy-dandy location.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-recommend-id="image://1b8547407b0080012e532d3449251d99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super heroes battle in an arena." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is the hottest new thing in the realm of hero shooters. And, it has launched with over 30 popular characters from the Marvel universe. While it’s important to spend time trying out every character to find one that works best for you, they all have different skill ceilings to consider. So, if you’re new to the game (or even hero shooters in general), here are three characters that are easy to pick up and play. — Billy Givens</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-characters-beginner-starting-squirrel-gir-1851716341">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-recommend-id="image://dff046deef8e2810911c18da9f9859f5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The camera circles the Avengers as they prepare for battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-wolverine-iron-fist-black-widow-1851711241"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>is out now and free to play on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. The hero shooter pretty shamelessly draws inspiration from <em>Overwatch</em>. As a result, NetEase’s swing at the genre feels like putting on a familiar glove to long-time players of Blizzard’s game. However, there are a few bits of minutiae that are different and worth keeping in mind, even if you’ve spent hundreds of hours in similar games. I put about 15 hours into <em>Marvel Rivals</em> during its test periods and about a few additional hours since its launch on December 5. So here are a few tips for newcomers if you’re jumping into the game for the first time. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6b4f55fa203e47e7e1dbc1a379c173e" data-recommend-id="image://d6b4f55fa203e47e7e1dbc1a379c173e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon rides atop Groot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon rides atop Groot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6b4f55fa203e47e7e1dbc1a379c173e" data-recommend-id="image://d6b4f55fa203e47e7e1dbc1a379c173e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket Raccoon rides atop Groot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re a Support player in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-heroes-similar-main-1851725562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-heroes-similar-main-1851725562">shooters like <em>Overwatch 2</em></a></span>, you’re probably on the hunt for the best Strategist in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.

            <p>Just 15 percent of Steam players spent time with new releases - defined as games released in 2024 - this year.</p>
<p>That's according to Steam itself, which gave us a little insight into the broader playing habits of its players as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/641297020996289523">Steam Replay 2024</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the recap not only shows you how many games you played and when, but also your favourite genres, the achievements you unlocked (the median was 13), the number of games played (for most, this is four), and your longest streak (the average was six days, apparently).</p>
<p>"How many games did you play, and how does that compare to last year? Did you unlock a bunch of achievements? What about your longest streak? These fun numbers and more are in your Replay," Valve teases.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It might seem odd to suggest that a game filled to the brim with tough-as-nails twitch action games, thinky arcade puzzlers, and even a full-blown narrative RPG is not nostalgic, but UFO 50, a compilation of 50 retro-inspired games of varying sizes, is full of surprises. It has its influences, of course. Magical Garden pulls on Snake. Valtress is something of a cross between Kid Icarus and Downwell. It has a steady dedication to looking and sounding like games of the past. However, UFO 50 draws as much on 2000s era game jam culture as the NES itself. Rather than a mere evocation of retro titles, UFO 50 has a longing for creative constriction. Each individual game's simplicity serves a widening and deepening, a desire to pull as much as possible out of every pixel. UFO 50 creates the feeling of wide-openness, that video games can be anything. This is a feeling that has only thrived on the margins in video games and thus un-markable as a generalized nostalgia. When big business wants you to believe the new hotness represents all that video games can be, it is refreshing to look backward and forward at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To my mind, UFO 50's retro aesthetic serves two purposes. First, it keeps games resource-light. Each game is bare in construction, often lacking explicit tutorialization. Most games have a mere six buttons to play with. It maintains the mysterious workings and iterations of arcade games, without the quarter-munching business model. Each game can only be so big lest it outscope the rest. So, the focus is on mechanical density and complexity, on the kind of replayability that comes from careful design, not endless racks of content. The feeling is closer to setting up an emulator loaded with cult classics than to a childhood memory of getting an 8-bit console for Christmas.</p><p dir="ltr">Second, the retro vibes focus on each game's individual decisions and ideas. Some of UFO 50's games--like Campanella, its sequel, and The Big Bell Race--have obvious relationships to each other. Others--like the surreal Waldorf's Journey and the strategic Avianos--feel as if they come from different worlds. However, all of UFO 50's games feel as if they are made of the same component parts: pixels, code, a few buttons. Yet there is so much possibility. The simplicity draws out the span of what is possible. It makes each new trick feel remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167"></a><figcaption>An example of the grid-based strategy game Avianos, where birds choose which Dinos to worship in order to gain strategic advantages.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of UFO 50's most-striking games is Mooncat, a two-button platform puzzler. Most of the game, at least on the first run, is found in learning how it works. You control a two-legged creature, presumably the titular mooncat, which moves in combinations and timings between its two buttons. There's a jump, a ground pound, a little dash, and the basic movement left to right, but none of these moves are done in the conventional way; all prior knowledge of how video games are "supposed" to work vanishes. The art direction is whimsical and odd, but with no small amount of menace. Green fields populated by little critters turn into ancient tombs interlaced with gigantic skeletons and harsh deserts overseen by a red sky. It is the sort of game that is difficult to imagine being an actual commercial product, even in 1985. Its presence among more straightforward games showcases that UFO 50 is experimental. Sometimes its offerings will fit into genre conventions, but often they won't.</p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, UFO 50's meta-narrative focuses on unearthing a forgotten catalog rather than revisiting classics. Its opening "cutscene" shows members of the UFO 50 team finding the game's fictional console in an old storage unit. This is not something enshrined in the annals of gaming history or the kind of thing you could (easily) discover at your local retro shop. It's overlooked. That's the reason the game opens on a storage unit rather than a mom-and-pop shop or a lovingly maintained collection (contrast this with retro collections like The Sega Master Collection, which features a main menu designed like a childhood bedroom). UFO 50's main menu focuses on the games themselves, showing cartridges. But they are not arranged on a shelf; instead, they are covered in cobwebs. Selecting a game you haven't yet played dusts it off. It's cutesy to be sure, but it conjures the archive more than the basement.</p><p dir="ltr">All this is to say, UFO 50 presents itself as an excavation rather than a return to the past. It wants you to discover, not to rediscover. There is no past to return to. Even in UFO 50's internal fiction, you are playing these games right now, not in some imaginary 1980s. The emphasis on discovery has a double effect: It helps these games feel alive and helps you approach them on their own merits, not just as mere echoes of the past. It is uncloying, dignified, but still playful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169"></a><figcaption>A level from Campanella, showcasing a tiny UFO, some slime-like critters, and a little maze of obstacles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I've made a lot of UFO 50's reduction, but it is also excessive. It's 50 whole games! It would be possible to write at length about any of them individually. But its excess is found in the wealth of its experience, in the diversity it presents itself with. Most big-budget video games are large and excessive, but they tend to emphasize the same tasks over and over and all feed into some meta goal. While it would take over a hundred hours to completely finish every one of UFO 50's offerings, each game is also a complete experience in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">There's some melancholy to UFO 50's unique position. <a href="https://pastebin.com/538TpwCp" rel="nofollow ">Critic Liz Ryerson describes UFO 50</a> as "about a sort of lost innocence for games and what they could be before they became a massive dominant cultural industry." Now video games, or at least the business of video games, is a relatively narrow set of genres. Open worlds have codified into Ubisoft bloat. Live-service games chase the brand integration of Fortnite or the expansion of Genshin Impact. Call of Duty has been the dominant first-person shooter for well over a decade. Mainstream games have lost their experimental edge. UFO 50 is perhaps the biggest scale that an experimental game can operate in. That's still pretty small.</p><p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, UFO 50 is worth celebrating. I have often lamented the lack of Martin Scorceses in video games. I don't long for more crime dramas or invocations of Catholic dread, but rather I want more game developers that admire video games' past. I want more developers who gesture to history not out of empty, preening nostalgia, but rather out of respect for it, out of a genuine willingness to learn from it, and a desire, not to replace or improve the past, but to expand and deepen our relationship to it. UFO 50 is a small but confident and exciting step in that direction.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>"The next-gen patch for the console versions of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will be released next year," GSC added. "We know you've asked us to update the PC versions of the original Stalker games, and we also plan to do that.</p>
<p>"The amount of support you've shown us since the game's launch still amazes us. Your support is truly a miracle of the Zone. We will see you next year!"</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">GSC Game World released the first major patch</a> for Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which addressed over 1800 issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Witcher series has never held back regarding romance options, but they’re usually short-lived and offer more of a break from the action than anything else. In 2015’s The Witcher 3, players were typically fed into an Option A vs. Option B model for their romantic choices, with a few sub-selection flings thrown in for good measure.</p>



<p>It has been promised that in The Witcher 4, CDPR will eliminate ‘romance for the sake of making a romance’.</p>

<h2 id="h-true-love">True Love</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red revealed The Witcher 4 during The Game Awards earlier this month. The team dropped a stunning six-minute trailer revealing Ciri as the game’s protagonist, not Geralt of Rivia. Those familiar with the story will recognise why this was always the only option for The Witcher games.</p>



<p>In The Witcher 3, the player can romance a few characters, with the most major choice laying in their ultimate decision between Yennefer and Triss. Even Ciri, who is a supporting character in The Wild Hunt, has a brief brush with romance.</p>



<p>The concept of incorporating a bit of romance into The Witcher 4 as a box tick isn’t going to be the case.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent interview</a>, CDPR’s Sebastian Kalemba, the game’s director, explained how they’re leaning more into the concept of forming relationships in The Witcher 4.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a part of the way we make games. It is a part of human nature. It’s a very normal thing. Without that I think we wouldn’t be able to tell the very full story.</p>



<p>We want to pay a lot of attention to it and make it super compelling and very meaningful. So it’s not just to make a romance for the sake of making a romance. That’s not the CDPR way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In CDPR’s most recent game, Cyberpunk 2077, forming a relationship with the options available is something that happens over many hours of play and several missions. It’s woven into the game’s choice patterns, and even small details, such as how characters speak in messages once in love with the protagonist, weigh into it.</p>



<p>We recently learned that The Witcher 4 will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-4s-map-size-and-quests-are-more-or-less-the-same-as-previous-title/">‘around the same-sized map’</a> as The Witcher 3.</p>

<p>When we introduced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/">last year's annual list of the best games</a> in this space, we focused on how COVID delays led to a 2023 packed with excellent big-name blockbusters and intriguing indies that seemed to come out of nowhere. The resulting flood of great titles made it difficult to winnow the year's best down to our traditional list of 20 titles.</p>
<p>In 2024 we had something close to the opposite problem. While there were definitely a few standout titles that were easy to include on this year's list (<em>Balatro</em>, <em>UFO 50</em>, and <em>Astro Bot</em> likely chief among them), rounding out the list to a full 20 proved more challenging than it has in perhaps any other year during my tenure at Ars Technica (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/01/im-a-man-of-wealth-and-taste/">way back in 2012!</a>). The games that ended up on this year's list are all strong recommendations, for sure. But many of them might have had more trouble making a Top 20 list in a packed year like 2023.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait to see if the release calendar seesaws back to a quality-packed one in 2025, but the forecast for big games like <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, and many, many more has us thinking that it might. In the meantime, here are our picks for the 20 best games that came out in 2024, in alphabetical order.</p>
<h2><em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<p><strong>Billy Basso; Windows, PS5, Xbox X/S, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>The Metroidvania genre has started to feel a little played out of late. Go down this corridor, collect that item, go back to the wall that can only be destroyed by said item, explore a new corridor for the next item, etc. Repeat until you've seen the entire map or get too bored to continue.</p>
<p><em>Animal Well</em> eschews this paint-by-numbers design and brings back the sense of mystery inherent to the best games in the genre. This is done in part by some masterful pixel-art graphics, which incorporate some wild 2D lighting effects and detailed, painterly sprite world. The animations—from subtle movements of the lowliest flower to terrifying, screen-filling actions from the game's titular giant animals—are handled with equal aplomb.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But <em>Animal Well</em> really shines in its often inscrutable map and item design. Many key items in the game have multiple uses that aren't fully explained in the game itself, requiring a good deal of guessing, checking, and observation to figure out how to exploit fully. Uncovering the arcane secrets of the game's multiple environmental blocks is often far from obvious and rewards players who like to experiment and explore.</p>
<p>Those arcane secrets can sometimes seem too obtuse for their own good—don't be surprised if you have to consult an outside walkthrough or work with someone to bust past some of the most inscrutable barriers put in your way. If you soldier through, though, you'll have been on one of the most memorable journeys of its type.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<p><strong>Team Asobi; PS5</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p><em>Astro Bot</em> is an unlikely success story. The team that made it, Studio Asobi, was for years dedicated to making small-scale projects that were essentially glorified tech demos for Sony's latest hardware. First there was <em>The Playroom</em>, which was just a collection of small experiences made to show off the features of the PlayStation 4's camera peripheral. Then there was <em>Astro Bot Rescue Mission</em>, which acted as a showcase for the first PlayStation VR headset.</p>
<p>But momentum really picked up with <em>Astro's Playroom</em>, the bite-size 2020 3D platformer that was bundled with every PlayStation 5—again to show off the hardware features. When I played it, my main thought was, "I really wish this team would make a full-blown game."</p>
<p>That's exactly what <em>Astro Bot</em> is: a 15-hourlong 3D platformer with AAA production values, with no goal other than just being an excellent game. Like its predecessors, it fully leverages all the hardware features of the PlayStation 5, and it's loaded with Easter eggs and fan service for players who've been playing PlayStation consoles for three decades.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like many 3D platformers, it's a collect-a-thon. In this case, you're gathering more than 300 little robot friends. All of them are modeled after characters from other games that defined the PlayStation platform, from <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Ico</em> to <em>The Last of Us</em>, from the obscure to the well-known.</p>
<p>Between those Easter eggs, the tightly designed gameplay, and the upbeat music, there's an ever-present air of joy and celebration in <em>Astro Bot</em>—especially for players who get the references. But even if you've never played any of the games it draws on, it's an excellent 3D platformer—perhaps the best released on any platform in the seven years since 2017's <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 will arguably be best remembered for beefy open-world games, serious narrative titles, and multiplayer shooters. Amid all that, I don't think anybody expected one of the best games ever released for the console to be a platformer that in some ways would feel more at home on the PlayStation 2—but that's what happened, and I'm grateful for the time I spent with it.</p>
<p>The only negative thing I have to say about it is that because of how it leverages the specific features of the DualSense controller, it's hard to imagine it'll ever be playable for anyone who doesn't own that device.</p>
<p>Is it worth buying a PS5 just to play <em>Astro Bot</em>? Probably not—as beefy as it is compared to <em>Astro's Playroom</em>, there's not enough here to justify that. But if you have one and you haven't played it yet, get on it, because you're missing out.</p>

<h2><em>Balatro</em></h2>
<p><strong>LocalThunk; Windows, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch, MacOS, iOS, Android</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>At first glance, video poker probably seems a bit too random to serve as the basis of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">yet another rogue-like deck-builder</a> experience. As anyone who's been to Atlantic City can tell you, video poker's hold-and-draw hand-building involves only the barest hint of strategy and is designed so the house always wins.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The genius of <em>Balatro</em>, then, is in the layers of strategy it adds to this simple, easy-to-grasp poker hand base. The wide variety of score or hand-modifying jokers that you purchase in between hands can be arranged in literally millions of combinations, each of which can change the way a particular run goes in ways both large and small. Even the most powerful jokers can become nearly useless if you run into the wrong debuffing Boss Blind, forcing you to modify your strategy mid-run to keep the high-scoring poker hands coming.</p>
<p>Then you add in a complex in-game economy, powerful deck-altering arcana cards, dozens of Deck and Stake difficulty options, and a Challenge Mode whose hardest options have continued to thwart me even after well over 100 hours of play. The result is a game that's instantly compelling and as addictive as a heater at a casino, only without the potential to lose your mortgage payment to a series of bad bets.</p>

<h2><em>The Crimson Diamond</em></h2>
<p><strong>Julia Minamata; Windows, Mac</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>Would you like to spend some time in a rural vacation town in Ontario, Canada, doing mineralogy fieldwork in the off-season? A better question, then: Would you like to go there in 16-color EGA, wandering through a classic adventure game, text parser and all?</p>
<p><i>The Crimson Diamond</i> is one of the most intriguing gaming trips I took this year. It’s an achievement in creative constraints, a cozy mystery, and an ear-catching soundtrack. It was made by a solo Canadian developer, inside <a href="https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/">Adventure Game Studio</a>, with some real work put into upgrading the text parser and (optional) mouse experience with reasonable quality-of-life concessions. The charming but mysterious plot gently pulls you along from one wonderfully realized 1980s-era IBM backdrop to the next. It feels like playing a game you forgot to unbox, except this one actually plays without a dozen compatibility tricks.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We are awash in game remasters and light remakes that toy with our memories of old systems and forgotten genres (and having a lot more time to play games). <i>The Crimson Diamond</i> does something much more interesting, finding just the right new story and distinct style to port backward to a bygone era. It’s worth the clicks for any fan of pointing, clicking, and investigating.</p>

<p>You can tell downloadable content has come a long way when we deign to put a piece of DLC on our best-games-of-the-year list in 2024.</p>
<p>Released two years after the megaton zeitgeist hit that was the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> bucks just as many modern gaming conventions as its base game did. Yes, it's DLC because it's digitally distributed add-on content, but while most AAA games get DLC that adds about 5–10 hours of stuff to do, <em>Shadow of the </em><em>Erdtree</em>'s scope actually fell somewhere between a full sequel and the expansions you'd buy in separate retail boxes for PC games in the 1990s and 2000s. It adds a large new landmass to explore, with multiple additional "legacy dungeons" and tentpole bosses, plus new mechanics and weapons aplenty.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game's designers cleverly mapped a whole new system on top of the base game's player levels and equipment, ensuring that you could still get the same satisfying sense of power progression, regardless of how deeply you'd gotten into the <em>Elden Ring</em> base game previously. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>attracted some criticism for its sharp difficulty—even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">more so than the base game</a>—but the same satisfying progression from hopelessness to triumph through perseverance as we enjoyed in 2022 is in play here.</p>
<p>As such, everything that was great about <em>Elden Ring</em> is also great about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. You could cynically call it more of the same, but when what we're getting more of is so delicious, it's hard to complain—especially given that this expansion includes some of the most compelling and original bosses in From Software history.</p>

<p>It didn't convert anyone who didn't dig the original, but fortunately that still left it with an audience of millions of people who were excited for a new challenge. Its impressive polish and scope land it on this list.</p>

<p>The first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/04/frostpunk-review-ice-burg/"><i>Frostpunk</i></a> asked if you could make the terrible decisions necessary for survival in a never-ending blizzard. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/frostpunk-2-goes-wider-and-more-political-but-keeps-the-gritty-stressful-joy/"><i>Frostpunk 2</i></a> asks you to manage something different, but no less dire: helping these people who managed to hold on keep their nascent civilization together. You can go deep with the fascists, the mystics, the hard-nosed realists, or the science nerds or try to play them all off one another to keep the furnace going.</p>
<p>It’s stressful, and it’s not at all easy, and the developers may have done <i>too</i> good a job of recreating the insane demands and interplay of human factions. The interface and navigation, sore spots on launch, have received a lot of attention, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-year-looks-huge-for-frostpunk-2-with-a-free-major-content-update-and-two-paid-dlcs">the roadmap for the game into 2025</a> looks intriguing. I’d probably recommend starting with the first game before diving into this, but <i>Frostpunk 2</i> is an accomplished, confident game in its own right. Human failings amidst an unfeeling snowpocalypse make for some engaging scenes.</p>

<p>The isometric demon-killing of the old-school <em>Diablo</em> games has endured over the decades, especially among those who remember playing in their youth. But the whole concept has been in need of a bit of an update now that we're in the age of <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its "Bullet Heaven" auto-shooter ilk.</p>
<p>Enter <em>Halls of Torment</em>, a game that is probably as close as it comes to aping old-school <em>Diablo</em>'s visual style without being legally actionable. Here, though, all the lore and story and exploration of the <em>Diablo</em> games has been replaced by a <em>lot</em> more enemies, all streaming toward your protagonist at the rate of up to 50,000 per hour. Much like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the name of the game here is dodging through those small holes in those swarms of enemies while your character automatically fills the screen with devastating attacks (that slowly level up as you play).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The wide variety of different playable classes—each with their own distinct strengths, weaknesses, and unique attack patterns—help each run feel distinct, even after you've smashed through the game's limited set of six environments. But there's plenty of cathartic replay value here for anyone who just wants to cause as much on-screen carnage as possible in a very short period of time.</p>

<p>Every so often, a multiplayer game releases to almost universal praise, and for a few months, seemingly everyone is talking about it. This year, that game was <em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game converted the 2015 original’s top-down shoot-em-up gameplay into third-person shooter action, and the switch-up was enough to bring in tons of players. Taking more than a few cues from <em>Starship Troopers</em>, the game asks you to "spread democracy" throughout the galaxy by mowing down hordes of alien bugs or robots during short-ish missions on various planets. Work together with your team, and the rest of the player base, to slowly liberate the galaxy.</p>
<p>I played <em>Helldivers 2</em> mostly as a “hang out game,” something to do with my hands and eyes as I chatted with friends. You can play the game “seriously,” I guess, but that would be missing the point for me. My favorite part of <em>Helldivers 2</em> is just blowing stuff up—bugs, buildings, and, yes, even teammates. Friendly fire is a core part of the experience, and whether by accident or on purpose, you will inevitably end up turning your munitions on your friends. My bad!</p>
<p>Some controversial balance patches put the game into a bit of an identity crisis for a while, but things seem to be back on track. I’ll admit the game didn’t have the staying power for me that it seemed to for others, but it was undeniably a highlight of the year.</p>

<p>A new game based on the Indiana Jones license has a lot to live up to, both in terms of the films and TV shows that inspired it and the well-remembered games that preceded it. <em>The Great Circle</em> manages to live up to those expectations, crafting the most enjoyable Indy adventure in years.</p>
<p>The best part of the game is contained in the main storyline, captured mainly in exquisitely madcap cut scenes featuring plenty of the pun-filled, devil-may-care quipiness that Indy is known for. Voice actor Troy Baker does a great job channeling Harrison Ford (by way of Jeff Goldblum) as Indy, while antagonist Emmerich Voss provides all the scenery-chewing Nazi shenanigans you could want from the ridiculous, magical-realist storyline.</p>
<p>The stealth-action gameplay is a little more pedestrian but still manages to distinguish itself with suitably crunchy melee combat and the enjoyable improvisation of attacking Nazis with everyday items, from wrenches to plungers. And while the puzzles and side-quests can feel a bit basic at times, there are enough hidden trinkets in out-of-the-way corners to encourage completionists to explore every inch of the game's intricately detailed open-world environments.</p>
<p>It's just the kind of light-hearted, escapist, exploratory fun we need in these troubled times. Welcome back, Indy! We missed you!</p>

<h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></h2>
<p><strong>Nintendo; Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>After decades and decades of Zelda games where you don't actually play as Zelda, there was a lot of pressure on a game where you finally get to control the princess herself as the protagonist (those CD-i monstrosities from the '90s are best forgotten). Fortunately, Zelda's turn in full control of her own series captures the franchise's old-school, light-hearted adventuring fun with a few modern twists.</p>
<p>The main draw here is the titular "echo" abilities, which let Zelda copy enemies and objects that can be summoned in multiple copies with a special wand. This eventually opens up to allow for a number of inventive ways to solve some intricate puzzles in what feels like a heavily simplified version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>'s more complex crafting tools.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>My favorite bit in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, though, might be summoning copies of defeated enemies to fight new enemies in a kind of battle royale. As much as I love Link's sword-swinging antics (which are partially captured here), just watching these magical minions do my combat for me is more than half of the fun in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Even without those twists, though, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides all the old-school 2D Zelda dungeon exploring you could hope for, and the lighthearted storyline to match. Here's hoping this isn't the last time we'll see Zelda taking a starring role in her own legends.</p>

<p>I went into this latest Digital Eclipse playable museum as someone who had only a passing familiarity with Jeff Minter. I knew him mainly as a revered game development elder with a penchant for psychedelic graphics and an association with <em>Tempest 2000</em>. Then I spent hours devouring <em>The Jeff Minter Story</em> on my Steam Deck during a long flight, soaking in the full history of a truly unique character in the annals of gaming history.</p>
<p>The emulated games on this collection are actually pretty hit or miss, from a modern game design perspective. But the collection of interviews and supporting material on offer here are top-notch, putting each game into the context of the time and of Minter's personal journey through an industry that was still in its infancy. I especially liked the scanned versions of Minter's newsletter, sent to his early fans, which included plenty of diatribes and petty dramas about his game design peers and the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>There are few other figures in the early history of games that would merit this kind of singular focus—even early games were too often the collaborative product of larger companies with a more corporate focus (as seen in Digital Eclipse's previous <em>Atari 50</em>. But I reveled in this opportunity to get to know Minter better for his unique and quixotic role in early gaming history.</p>

<h2><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></h2>
<p><strong>Simogo; Windows, PS4/5, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>You'd be forgiven for finding <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> at least a little pretentious. Everything from the black-and-white presentation—laced with only the occasional flash of red for emphasis —to the <em>Twin Peaks</em>-style absurdist writing to the grand pronouncements on the Importance and Beauty of Art make for a game that feels like it's trying a little too hard, at points.</p>
<p>Push past that surface, though, and you'll find one of the most intricately designed interactive puzzle boxes ever committed to bits and bytes. <em>Lorelei</em> goes well beyond the simple tile-pushing and lock-picking tasks that are laughably called "puzzles" in most other adventure games. The mind-teasers here require real out-of-the-box thinking, careful observation of the smallest environmental details, and multi-step deciphering of arcane codes.</p>
<p>This is a game that's not afraid to cut you off from massive chunks of its content if you're not able to get past a single near-inscrutable locked door puzzle—don't feel bad if you need to consult a walkthrough at some point to move on. It's also a game that practically requires a pen and paper notes to keep track of all the moving pieces—your notebook will look like the scribblings of a madman by the time you're done.</p>
<p>And you may actually feel a little mad as you try to unravel the meaning of the game's multiple labyrinthine layers and self-aware, time-bending, magical-realist storyline. When it all comes together at the end, you may just find yourself surprisingly moved not just by the intricate design, but by that oft-pretentious plot as well.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em></h2>

<p>Good tactics games are all about how the game plays in your mind. How many ways can you overcome this obstacle, maximize this turn, and synergize your squad’s abilities? So it’s a very nice bonus when such a well-made pile of engaging decisions also happens to look absolutely wonderful and capture the incredibly detailed sense of motion of a legendary run-and-gun franchise.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>That’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/metal-slug-tactics-is-an-odd-mix-of-arcade-shooter-and-grid-strategy-that-works/"><i>Metal Slug Tactics</i></a>, and it’s one of the most surprising successes of 2024. It delivers the look and feel of a franchise that isn’t easy to get right, and it translates those games’ feeling of continuous motion into turn-based tactics. The more you move, shoot, and team up each turn, the better you’ll do. You can do a level or two on a subway ride, crank out a rogue-ish run on a lunch break, and keep getting rewarded with new characters, unlocks, and skill tree branches.</p>
<p>If you’re always contemplating a replay of <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>, but might like a new challenge, consider giving this unlikely combination of goofy arcade revival and deep strategy a go.</p>

<h2><em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit</em></h2>
<p><strong>Walaber Entertainment; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>The rise of popular, ultra-detailed racing sims like <em>Gran Turismo</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> has coincided with a general decline in the drift-heavy, arcadey side of the genre. Titles like <em>Ridge Racer</em> <em>Sega Rally</em> or even <em>Crazy Taxi</em> now belong more in the industry's nostalgic memories than its present top-sellers.</p>
<p><em>Parking Garage Rally Circuit</em> is doing its best to bring the arcade racer genre back single-handedly. The game's perfectly tuned drifting controls make every turn a joyful sliding experience, complete with chainable post-drift boosts for those who want to tune that perfect speedy line. It captures that great feeling of being just on the edge of losing control, while still holding onto the edge of that perfect drift.</p>
<p>It all takes place, as the name implies, winding up, down, over, and through some well-designed parking garages. Each track's short laps (which take a minute or less) ensure you can practically memorize the best paths after just a little bit of play. But the stopped cars and large traffic dividers provide for some hilarious physics-based crashes when your racing line does go wrong.</p>
<p>The game earns extra nostalgia points for a variety of visual effects and graphics options that accurately mimic Dreamcast-era consoles and/or emulation-era PC hardware. But the game's extensive online leaderboards and ghost-racers help it feel like a decidedly modern take on a classic genre.</p>

<h2><em>Pepper Grinder</em></h2>
<p><strong>Ahr Ech; Windows, MacOS, Linux, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>It's amazing how far a platform game can get on nothing more than a novel control scheme. <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is a case in point here, based around a tiny, blue-haired protagonist who uses an oversized drill to tunnel through soft ground like some kind of human-machine-snake hybrid.</p>
<p>Navigating through the dirt in large, undulating curves is fun enough, but the game really shines when Pepper bursts out through the top layer of dirt in large, arcing jumps. Chaining these together, from dirt clump to dirt clump, is the most instantly compelling new 2D navigation scheme we've seen in years and creates some beautiful, almost balletic curves through the levels once you've mastered it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is that the game is over practically before it really gets going. And while some compelling time-attack and item-collection challenges help to extend the experience a bit, we really hope some new DLC or a proper sequel is coming soon to give us a new excuse to wind our way through the dirt.</p>

<h2><em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em></h2>
<p><strong>Color Gray Games; Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, PS4/5, Xbox One/Series, Switch</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>In 2022, <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> proved that details like a controllable protagonist or elaborate cut scenes are unnecessary for a good murder mystery-solving puzzle adventure. All you need is a series of lightly animated vignettes, a way to uncover the smallest hidden details in those vignettes, and a fill-in-the-blanks interface to let you piece together the disparate clues.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, <em>Rise</em> moves the 18th-century setting of the original into the 20th century, bringing the mysterious, powerful idol to the attention of both academic scientists and mass media executives who seek to exploit its mind-altering powers. From your semi-omniscient perspective, you have to figure out not just the names and motivations of those pulled into the idol's orbit, but the somewhat inscrutable powers of the idol itself.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Rise</em> adds a few interesting new twists, like the ability to scrub through occasional video animations for visual clues and the ability to track certain scenes throughout multiple times of day. At its core, though, this is an extension of the best-in-class, pure deductive reasoning gameplay we saw in the original game, with a slightly more modern twist. This is yet another 2024 favorite that requires strong attention to detail and logical inference from very small hints.</p>
<p>It all comes together in a satisfying conclusion that leaves the door wide open for a sequel that we can't wait for.</p>

<h2><em>Satisfactory</em></h2>
<p><strong>Coffee Stain Studios; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>Danish publisher Coffee Stain makes gaming success seem so simple. Put a game with a goofy feel, a corporate dystopia, and complex systems into early access. Iterate, cultivate feedback and a sense of ownership with the community. Take your time, refine, and then release the game, without any revenue-grabbing transactions or add-ons, beyond fun cosmetics. They did it with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/deep-rock-galactic-celebrates-5-years-by-letting-players-dig-like-its-2018/"><i>Deep Rock Galactic</i></a>, and they’ve done it again with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/satisfactory-hits-1-0-removing-your-last-excuse-to-avoid-falling-in-deep/"><i>Satisfactory</i></a>. By the time the game hit 1.0, the only thing left to add was “Premium plumbing.”</p>
<p>It’s remarkably fun to live on the bad-guy side of <i>The Lorax,</i> exploiting a planet’s natural resources to create a giant factory system producing widgets for corporate wellbeing. The first-person perspective might seem odd for game with such complex systems, but it heightens your sense of accomplishment. You didn’t just choose to put a conveyor belt between that ore extractor and that fabricator; you personally staked out that deposit, and your ran the track yourself.</p>
<p>The systems are incredibly deep, but it can be quite relaxing to wander around your planet-sized industrial park, thinking up ways that things might run better, faster, with no interruptions. It’s the kind of second job you’re happy to buy into, giving you a deep sense of accomplishment for learning the ins and outs of this system, even as it gently mocks you for engaging with it. <i>Satisfactory</i> has itself worked for years to refine the most efficient gameplay for its bravest fans, and now it’s ready to employ the rest of us.</p>

<h2><em>Sixty Four</em></h2>
<p><strong>Oleg Danilov; Windows, Mac</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>I try not to think about, or write about, games in the manner of “dollars to enjoyment ratio.” Games often get cheaper over time, everybody enjoys them differently, and they’re art, too, as well as commerce. But, folks, come on: $6 for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/sixty-four-is-an-idle-clicker-a-factory-sim-and-a-dark-extractive-journey/"><i>Sixty Four</i></a>? If you play it for one hour and just smile a few times at its oddities and tiny cubes, that was less than a big-city latte or beer.</p>
<p>But you will almost certainly play <i>Sixty Four</i> for more than one hour, and maybe many more hours than that if you enjoy games with systems, building, and resources. You build and place machines to extract resources, use those resources to fund new and better machines, rearrange your machines, and eventually create beautiful workflows that are largely automated. Why do you do this? It’s a fun, dark mystery.</p>
<p>The game looks wonderful in its <i>SimCity 2000</i>/<i>3000</i>-esque style. It can be mentally taxing, but you can’t really lose; you can even leave the game window open in the background while you convince your boss or remote work software that you’re otherwise productive. It’s a fever dream I’d recommend to most anybody, unless they dread a repeat of the many lost days to games like <i>Factorio</i>, <i>Satisfactory</i>, or even <i>Universal Paperclips</i>. Just wishlist it, in that case; what could go wrong?</p>

<p>What can you do to spice up turn-based tactics, a rather mature genre?</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/tactical-breach-wizards-weaves-engaging-tactics-with-lively-dialogue/"><i>Tactical Breach Wizards</i></a> adds future-seeing, time-bending, hex-placing wizards, for one thing. It refines the heck out of grid combat, for another, adding window-tossing and door-sealing into the mix, and giving enemies a much wider array of attacks than area-of-effect variations. Finally, it wraps this all up in an inventive sci-fi narrative, one with an engaging plot, characters that reveal themselves one quip at a time, and an overall sense of wonderment at a charming, bizarre world of militarized magic.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>In other words, you could put some joy into your turn-based combat, while still offering intricate challenges and clever levels.</p>
<p>Tom Francis’ unique sense of humor, seen previously in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/"><i>Gunpoint</i></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/"><i>Heat Signature</i></a>, is given space here to shine, and it’s a wonderful wrapper for all the missions and upgrade decisions. It’s pretty ridiculous to be a wizard, wielding a laser-scoped rifle that fires crystal energy, plotting how to hit three guards at once with your next blast. <i>Tactical Breach Wizards</i> knows this, jokes about it, and then celebrates with you when you pull it off. It’s both a hoot, and a very good shoot.</p>

<h2><em>UFO 50</em></h2>
<p><strong>Mossmouth; Windows</strong></p>
<figure>
    
      </figure>

<p>In recent years, modern games have started evoking the blocky polygons and smeary textures of early 3D games to appeal to nostalgic 20- and 30-somethings. <em>UFO 50</em> has its nostalgic foot placed firmly in an earlier generation of '80s and '90s console gaming, with a bit of early '00s Flash game design thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Flipping your way through the extremely wide variety of games on offer here is like an eminently enjoyable trip through random titles in an emulator's (legally obtained) classic ROMs folder—just set in an alternate universe. There are plenty of shmups and platform games befitting the ostensible gaming era being recreated—but you also get full-fledged strategy, puzzle, arcade, racing, adventure, and RPG titles, on top of a few so unique that I can't find any real historical genre analog for. These well-designed titles evoke the classics—everything from <em>Bad Dudes</em> and <em>Bubble Bobble</em> to <em>Super Dodge Ball</em> and <em>Smash TV</em>—without ever feeling like a simple rehash of games you remember from your youth.</p>
<p>While there's the usual spread of quality you'd expect from such a wide-ranging collection, even the worst-made title in <em>UFO 50</em> shows a level of care and attention to detail that will delight anyone with even a passing interest in game design and/or history. Not every game in <em>UFO 50</em> will be one of your all-time favorites, but I'd be willing to wager that any gamer of a certain age will find quite a few that will eat away plenty of pleasant, nostalgic hours.</p>

		<p>“Yeah, but is it fun?” That’s the question that so often burns into any discussion of a new and upcoming game. You can absolutely have tense and gruelling experiences, explore traumatic narratives, and do so with cutting edge graphics, but so many games put pure enjoyment, fun and satisfying feel first and foremost.</p>
<p>So… which games felt the best and most fun for us in 2024?</p>

<p>One of the reasons why <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> is picking up so many awards this year is that pretty much anyone can play it. If you are old enough to use a controller you can enjoy it, and the mechanics are so simple that anyone can understand them.</p>
<p>Each world brings something new with Astro Bot joined by a companion that enhances his skills in some fashion, floating like a balloon or turning into an indestructible spikey ball. It’s then simple logic – and real world logic at that – which allows you to progress. You need to get higher? Turn into the balloon and float up, simple. There’s no faffing about with special powers or complex button pushing, a single button press and you are on your way. As you progress through the world the use of the power up becomes more integral and you learn how to use it more subtly, culminating in a boss battle that requires you use all the knowledge you have gained over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Astro Bot is also insanely addictive, where finishing the game is just the first step. You then still have the challenge modes and the delightful task of rescuing all the Astro Bots from the many PlayStation games and watching them interact,</p>
<p>Let’s not pretend Astro Bot invented platforming, Nintendo have that honour with Donkey Kong, but Team Asobi have delivered another perfect example of the genre.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Tuffcub</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If you’re expecting Balatro to play like a familiar game of Texas hold ’em, then you’ve got another thing coming. Thankfully, that thing is a gorgeously put together roguelite deckbuilder that riffs on poker, rummy, solitaire and so much more. Each stage (blind) that you take on has a score target, where you play hands that dish out chips per card value and multiply that score based on the hand, Joker card modifiers and more.</p>
<p>It’s a satisfying puzzle to unpick, the scores you chase constantly growing, the multipliers increasing, and the oddball modifiers from boss blinds, conditional Jokers and more.</p>
<p>– Stefan L</p>
<h2>3D Don’t Die, Mr. Robot – Runner-up</h2>
<p>If there was one thing I was not expecting this year, it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/3d-dont-die-mr-robot-review/">3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot</a> being one of the best-playing new games of 2024. A sequel to Don’t Die, Mr Robot, this game is just pure arcade vibes. There’s no story to worry about, no worrying about your character build or gear stats. It is just you, a robot, lots of enemies, and exploding fruit as you chase high scores. 3D Don’t Die, Mr Robot challenges your reactions while wrapped up in an approachable package, with levels that get steadily tougher until you realise a few hours have passed by as you try to chase a level’s platinum trophy.</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has released a new special trailer for BLEACH Rebirth of Souls, with the sole focus of this trailer being the character Shinji Hirako. It is around two minutes long, with Shinji saying some iconic lines which are voiced by Aleks Le. The trailer also shows the character Hiyori, though going by the gameplay it seems Hiyori will be a move summon for Shinji, rather than a standalone character. However, that could change.</p>
<p><iframe title="BLEACH Rebirth of Souls — Shinji Hirako Special Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAY1-pUCX2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Shinji is a captain and one of the Visored, which could mean more of the Visored are going to be added to the roster too. Like the other characters on the roster, Shinji will be able to launch powerful attacks to shift momentum if he is close to being defeated. It is something that will be a core element of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls gameplay.</p>
<p>Three versions of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls are now available to pre-order too. The standard edition is just the game, and will cost £54.99. The Digital Deluxe edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, and soul crystal set 2, which is used to upgrade player abilities. This edition will cost £79.99. The Digital Ultimate edition includes the base game, season pass including seven days of early access, soul crystal 2 and 3, Thousand-Year Blood War Costume Set and Rebirth of Souls Costume Set. This edition will cost £94.99. Those who pre-order also get the Toshiro and Yoruichi Thousand-Year Blood War costume sets.</p>

<p>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls has been given a release date of March 21st, with the confirmed platforms being PC, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>It's been a long while since Square Enix discussed Kingdom Hearts IV. The fourth mainline installment in the action RPG franchise developed in collaboration with Disney was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on the series' 20th anniversary, which happened in April 2022. Since then, though, we haven't heard a peep from official sources.</p>
<p>Some in the vast Kingdom Hearts community are understandably getting antsy, especially with the no-show at The Game Awards 2024 earlier this month. However, KH focused YouTuber TheGamersJoint has recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=xUZXN0YVq8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor about a potential Square Enix event taking place in just two months. Here's the relevant tidbit from his video:</p>
<p><em>Recently, I have actually heard a little tidbit of information. Take this with a grain of salt, but this has come from a source of mine. I'll keep them anonymous, but I have heard the reason why Square Enix were absent from Summer Games Fest along with The Game Awards is because they are planning to start doing their own showcases, with one happening in February.</em></p>
<p><em>At some point, Square Enix are going to need to step forward to say, hey, this is our roadmap for 2025. Looking at an event of their own in February does actually make a lot of sense. Now, of course, I'm not going to put all of my eggs in one basket. I'll believe it when I see it. But we should, if it is going to happen, get an official announcement maybe sometime in early February.</em></p>
<p><em>It's been a long time, though, since Square Enix have done their own presentation. Back in the day, these used to be known as Square Enix Presents, so maybe, possibly, they're bringing back Square Enix Presents.</em></p>
<p>He's definitely right on that count - the last Square Enix Presents was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t30FL8a9KWs&amp;pp=ygUUc3F1YXJlIGVuaXggcHJlc2VudHM%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> on June 13, 2021, as part of E3 2021. As for the rest, the YouTuber himself tells his followers to keep their expectations in check. However, it has been a long time indeed since we heard anything new about Kingdom Hearts IV, and it's not the only upcoming title from the Japanese publisher that's been missing in action for a long time. That's certainly also the case for Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate, which was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-development-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in early January 2020. We later learned that DQXII is <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-is-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-story-is-already-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by Unreal Engine 5</a><span> and is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-is-being-co-developed-by-orca-dev-is-recruiting-unreal-engine-5-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-developed by Orca</a>, which also helped create</span> the previous entry in the JRPG franchise. However, both news stories are from 2021. The game is certainly overdue for an update from Square Enix.</p>
<p>Returning to Kingdom Hearts IV, we do know a few tidbits of info from the original announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like Dragon Quest XII, it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-ue5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powered by Unreal Engine 5</a>, delivering greatly improved visuals</li>
<li>However, this will limit the amount of playable worlds, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-improved-visuals-will-limit-the-number-of-disney-worlds-tetsuya-nomura-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Square Enix Director Tetsuya Nomura</a></li>
<li>The Keyblade can now transform into a grappling hook to help with traversal</li>
<li>There will be a new 'scrap and build' gameplay mechanics</li>
<li>The daily life of protagonist Sora will be explored in greater detail than before</li>
</ul>
<p>A rumor from a few months ago also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the final game will look different from the reveal trailer and that some sort of online functionality will be included. A potential port for the Nintendo Switch 2 was also part of that rumor.</p>
<p>Whether through the rumored February event or at the regular events later in the year, Square Enix are bound to share more about Kingdom Hearts IV and Dragon Quest XII throughout 2025. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the latest news and rumors on both titles.</p>
