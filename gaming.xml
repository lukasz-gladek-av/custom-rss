After last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-look-reveals-companions-and-fan-favourite-returning-character">cinematic trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard which detailed the game's full suite of seven companion characters</a>, today brings our first - albeit very brief - glimpse at actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
A short clip shared to social media platform X shows series regular Varric in Minrathous, capital of the Tevinter  Imperium region, a location we have heard plenty about - but never seen before in a mainline Dragon Age game.

<p>
Varric is hot on the tail of Solas following the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, though I imagine things won't be as easy as he makes out here. Minrathous, meanwhile, or the quick glimpse we get of it, looks suitably grim. I'm getting dark Ankh Morpork vibes.

<p>The footage, and an accompanying press release, confirms The Veilguard's player character will be named Rook. </p>
<p>"Dragon Age: The Veilguard features some of the deepest companion storylines in Dragon Age history, navigating romance, tragic loss and complex choices that will affect relationships with players and the fate of The Veilguard," said creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>"BioWare's storytelling roots shine through every chapter of this adventure, and we are incredibly excited for Dragon Age fans as well as those new to the series to experience this crafted, character-driven narrative that is so intertwined with our studio's DNA."</p>
<p>
We'll see much more of Dragon Age: The Veilguard tomorrow in BioWare's big gameplay reveal livestream. That's set for 4pm UK time - and you'll be able to watch it right here on Eurogamer.

That roadmap currently runs through four seasons, each with a new playable character, a new playable environment, and additional activities, skins, and balance updates. <em>Suicide Squad</em> is currently finishing the first episode of season 1 with a second episode expected to drop soon, but Rocksteady Games hasn’t been clear about the timing, or if future seasons will last just as long. </p><figure id="" data-id="b33f8b705b23438f62387a40d23aa6e1" data-recommend-id="image://b33f8b705b23438f62387a40d23aa6e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1263" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Promotional art shows Suicide Squad's first year of contact.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I hate small talk. I don't feel I'm any good at it. I don't want to engage in it. I practically run from it if I see it coming. But I love talking about big ideas, especially philosophy. Quite obviously, that makes me annoying. I admit it. People minding their own business in a casual setting may feel assaulted by my unprovoked diatribes about Nagel's concept of moral luck, humankind's supposed dominion over other animals, or the virtues of a restorative justice system. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-philosopher-2-governments-and-grievances/" data-ref-id="5000-591162">Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances</a>, everyone in my personal life can enjoy a reprieve from my ceaseless desire to debate and discuss topics like these as I work to beat this game instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Pro Philosopher 2 (PP2) is modeled closely after the Ace Attorney series but recontextualizes Capcom's art style and mechanics to focus on philosophical debates rather than pit players in a court drama. Here you don't present evidence that refutes the claims being spoken from the witness stand; you find holes in the arguments of your verbal sparring partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBrzfQsnmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tFBrzfQsnmQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first game, which focused on moral philosophy specifically, is on Steam for free following a debut on Kongregate years ago that earned it some cult praise. I came to the series with the upcoming second game, which very pointedly focuses on political philosophy this time around. Because if there's one thing gamers love, it's politics in their games.</p><p dir="ltr">Jokes aside, Pro Philosopher 2 is made for people like me who sincerely <em>do</em> feel that way--and it's also self-aware enough to take digs at itself in the demo I played. The game supposes a metaphysical realm in which you have access to numerous philosophers from world history and you can attempt to unravel their worldviews. In the demo, which is available for a limited time as part of Steam Next Fest starting today, you'll get to take on Machiavelli, author of The Prince, whose might-makes-right philosophy still lingers in our real world all too often today.</p><p dir="ltr">It serves as a strong introduction to the game, because not only will you get to learn the ropes of the game's debate mechanics--in which you ask clarifying and backing questions before challenging your opponent's perspective armed with their own words--but it also quickly becomes obvious how relevant these centuries-old points of view still often are--for better or worse. For those interested in the subject matter but perhaps not as well-versed in it, the game even feels like a strong introduction to the material.</p><p dir="ltr">In my demo level, I had to carefully dissect Machiavelli's words to try and prove why it actually <em>isn't </em>better for a leader to be feared than loved. There were often many wrong answers and few right ones, and each wrong answer would damage my credibility rating like a health bar, which I find to be an awesomely creative way to transpose a debate into a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">The game pairs its Ace Attorney-like 2D cartoonish art with a serious understanding of the subject matter, but even then it doesn't take itself too seriously. When I initially failed to beat Machiavelli in the demo, the characters discussed how it might not be a strong first impression with which to sway me into buying the game, all in a very fourth-wall-breaking manner. And during the course of any debate, you're armed with a secret, albeit ineffective, weapon: You can simply tell your rival they stink. Literally. You can use the "you stink!" reply to resort to the debate tactics of a fourth-grader, and honestly, that's still seen pretty often in modern politics, so I think it's fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">Enjoying the demo for PP2 as much as I did, I'm now looking forward to the full game when it launches later this year, and in the meantime, I'm perhaps even more excited to go back to the first one and argue moral philosophy--which is really where I do my best annoy-everyone-around-me work. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120070/Pro_Philosopher_2_Governments__Grievances/" rel="nofollow ">try the demo for yourself for a limited time on Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/" rel="nofollow ">download the original</a>, which is free.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Episode 1: Echoes</h2><p dir="ltr">The first episode, Echoes, starts Tuesday, June 11, and deals directly with the aftermath of The Final Shape's conclusion. The Witness, Destiny 2's ultimate antagonist up until now, is defeated, but the paracausal energy it embodied isn't gone. Instead, it mixed with the Light of the Traveler to manifest weird artifacts from the Witness's memory, shooting them out into the solar system. The episodes all deal with the fallout of what those sources of power to do the worlds where they land and the people who find them, with the first one resulting in major shifts to Nessus.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie said that players will head to Nessus to find the echo and discover the location has been physically altered, with the Vex enemies there acting strangely. The episode comes with a new activity, Breach Executable, which Bungie described as an "arena-style offensive" in which you're trying to cap geysers of Radiolaria (otherwise known as "Vex milk") while holding off hordes of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525"></a><figcaption>Strange things are afoot inside Nessus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The episode is also going to take players deeper into Nessus to uncover secrets of what used to be there--including, apparently, a whole lost civilization. It looks like that will include more than just a few superficial changes to Nessus as it tells its story. Bungie also teased a new villain who might be behind what's happening with the Vex and said the Vex will exhibit new behavior, changing up how they act in battle.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 2: Revenant</h2><p dir="ltr">The second episode is Revenant, one that deals with Scorn leader Fikrul, otherwise known as the Fanatic. Bungie described the Episode as having a sort of "vampire-hunter" theme, and it'll heavily concern the Fallen, who are finally trying to establish a new permanent home since their own homeworld, Riis, was destroyed by the Witness. Bungie said you'll team up with the Fallen to become a Slayer Baron, essentially a Fallen monster hunter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Revenant suggests armor inspired by the Scorn and the act of killing monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In practice, the vampire-hunter theme is informing the armor aesthetic--you look a lot like you're in Bloodborne or the movie Van Helsing. Fikrul also has a Dracula castle, so it sounds like we'll be Castlevania-ing our way through that. As for new gameplay, Bungie mentioned a potion-crafting system, where you'll be able to create potions that provide different combat buffs and influence what loot drops you receive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 3: Heresy</h2><p dir="ltr">The final episode, Heresy, concerns the Hive. The Final Shape saw Savathun standing as both an ally and an antagonist to the Guardians, and her sister, Xivu Arath, is still out in the universe somewhere as a potential threat. Bungie said the episode is going to shake up the existing relationships in the Hive god pantheon, which sounds ominous and potentially important for Destiny 2's future.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the relevant details of what's taking place: We're headed back to the Dreadnaught, the big Hive battleship that was introduced in Destiny's The Taken King expansion and has been kind of chilling in the orbit of Saturn ever since. It'll have an activity Bungie likened to The Coil from the Season of the Wish, although we don't have many details about how it'll actually work. Bungie referred to an "eldritch force" players will face aboard the Dreadnaught and showed off two armor sets--one that takes cues from resident Hive expert and former Hive god Eris Morn, and another that imagines being a navigator on the Dreadnaught. That last one has the flair of an 18th century officer's uniform from a European navy, but made out of bones.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Destiny 2 Year 11</h2><p dir="ltr">The last thing Bungie did was tease Destiny 2 content in 2025, although it provided precisely zero details about what that might entail. The final screen of the vidoc just listed the name "Codename: Frontiers" with the Destiny 2 logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523"></a><figcaption>Here is what we know about Year 11: this image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a couple things to intuit from that slide, at least. First, the use of the Destiny 2 logo might suggest that we're not in for a Destiny 3 anytime soon, despite some rumors to the contrary. To some degree, that make sense--with massive player investment in Destiny 2, rebooting the community in a whole new game has its risks, even if that might help Bungie deal with some of the current game's technical limitations.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the name, Codename: Frontiers might suggest expanding Destiny 2 beyond the solar system, where the game has taken place up until now. Before the original Collapse that kicked off the story and created the world we've been playing in, humanity was trying to expand beyond Sol and out into the rest of the universe, and it would make some sense for the story to go back to that direction, cleaning a lot of the slate for something new. But that's all speculative at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we at least have a better understanding of where things are going from The Final Shape for the next year. Bungie didn't mention any new dungeons or raids among the episodes, but the Annual Pass that was made available with The Final Shape buys access to a dungeon, so we can expect at least one to pop up sooner or later, too.</p>

<p data-characters="490" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2013, Intelligible Games released the <em>Ace Attorney-inspired</em> <em>Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher</em> for web browsers, where instead of catching murderers in over-the-top courtroom dramas, you debated with real-world philosophers from throughout history to deduce the true nature of morality. It saw a full remake on Steam in 2023 but, 10 years after the original, the same team is back with a proper sequel; one that shifts its focus towards that oh so favoured of topics among gamers: politics.</p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Titled <em>Pro Philosopher 2: Governments &amp; Grievances</em>, I was able to test out a short demo ahead of its release as part of Steam Next Fest (it should be available for download by the time you’re reading this). And by short, I do mean short; you can easily clear it in 20 minutes. However, it does succinctly sum up what you can expect from the full game: interesting topics of debate, a fun sense of humour, and a lot of blatant similarities to <em>Ace Attorney</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="1077" data-current-count="1077" data-injectable="true">A part of me feels bad directly comparing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> to Capcom’s visual novel series, but one look at it and you’ll see <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> doesn’t just wear the <em>Ace Attorney</em> influences on its sleeves; it’s dressed head to toe in them. Not only are its core gameplay mechanics functionally identical, but even aspects of its presentation borrow liberally from <em>Ace Attorney</em>. Characters have exaggerated reactions when taken by surprise, and they let out cries of “Nonsense!” during arguments, which have the same energy as Phoenix Wright’s iconic “Objection!”, right down to the word smacking into the screen in bold red letters. This may risk costing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> any semblance of its own identity, but it’s clear these similarities come out of reverence for <em>Ace Attorney</em> and not a cynical attempt at copying it in the hopes of recreating its popularity. Plus, as a die-hard <em>Ace Attorney</em> fan myself, I can’t help but crack a smile at the ways <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> lifts elements from Capcom’s work.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">The thought of a game that requires you to engage in political debates and point out the flaws in each philosopher’s way of thinking sounds like a daunting and difficult task, but it’s easy to get to grips with if you’ve played even one <em>Ace Attorney</em> game. Instead of tangible evidence, you have an idea slate, which holds ideas and concepts you can use to challenge your opponent’s statements, no different to spotting contradictions in an <em>Ace Attorney</em> testimony. Challenging incorrectly will reduce your Credibility, and if that runs out it’s game over. </p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"> It’s a very simple idea in practice and, much like how you can press for further testimony in <em>Ace Attorney</em>, you can ask for clarification if you think a specific statement is too vague, or ask your opponent to back up their claim with evidence. Doing these can result in new ideas for the idea slate or additional statements. There’s no punishment for using the Clarification and Backing options on every statement, which is perfect for the most cautious of players (you’ll also get some amusing dialogue out of it). And reaching the end of a statement earns you a slight hint on what to do should you be completely lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">I got to grips with the demo incredibly easily, but I have to imagine the full game will prove far more challenging. One extra gameplay mechanic is alluded to but isn’t featured in the demo, and given the very nature of the political debate and its complexities, there could be some real head-scratching puzzles that’ll leave more than a fair share of players stumped. It’s obviously too soon to tell how these will be handled, and whether the difficulty will be fairly balanced or not. At the very least, the <em>Ace Attorney</em>-esque presentation and fun banter between protagonist Ari and her fellow cast members should keep you engaged, and may even help you learn some new things about the history of politics.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="740" data-current-count="1040" data-injectable="true"><em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>‘s slightly goofy sense of humour won’t be for everyone, but it definitely got some light chuckles out of me. Mostly from how it portrays actual philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as this arrogant genius, regularly cracking a smug smile as he lords his superior intellect. Liberties are absolutely going to be taken with how these real-world figures are depicted, but it makes for an entertaining experience nonetheless. You also have the option during debates to just insult your opponent with a “You stink!,” which is designed to never work and cost you credibility. Yet I can see players using it anyway if only to see how each philosopher reacts to being dragged into your average Twitter argument.</p>
 <p data-characters="1132" data-current-count="1132" data-injectable="true">What will likely make or break <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>, however, is exactly how it handles its choices of debate topics. Based on the demo, it fortunately doesn’t feel as if it will try and pursue a neutral stance throughout. Machiavelli argues in favour of blatant totalitarianism, believing a stable state of government is only possible with a single ruler in charge; one untethered by pesky morals. I like to think we can all agree that’s an awful idea, and it’s one Ari (and by extension the game and the development team) completely refute, but will this same approach be taken with future debates? What if the game requires the player to make an argument they fundamentally don’t agree with? Will <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> even broach the more controversial topics, or will it play things safe and stick to dismantling outdated or unpopular arguments that don’t hold water in the 21st century? It’s a tricky balancing act, though I’d rather see the game take at least some kind of stance instead of flaking out at the last minute and pulling some “all sides are equally valid” nonsense.</p>
 <p data-characters="948" data-current-count="948" data-injectable="false">Regardless, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> is one to watch for anyone with an interest in visual novels, logic puzzles, and/or political discourse that doesn’t quickly devolve into hurling slurs at one another. It sounds like it’ll be a pretty meaty experience too, with it promising more philosopher opponents than the five its predecessor had, though an exact number hasn’t been confirmed. A couple of examples shown in trailers are 17th century Englishman John Locke (who looks delightfully foppish) and Chinese philosopher Confucius, so there’s already some decent variety to the kind of views that players will need to engage with. Mechanically, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> seems perfectly sound, and building a game all around political debate, especially in the current climate, is a gutsy decision I applaud Intelligible Games for making. I just hope it has actually interesting or insightful things to say about its various debate topics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-gets-new-voice-chat-moderation-that-cannot-be-turned-off-in-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You can always turn off voice chat.</h2></div><section><p>EA has added new voice chat moderation features to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> designed to promote more positive play within the game.</p><p>Battlefield 2042, like many competitive multiplayer games, suffers from some toxic behavior from players. These new features now live in the first-person shooter over two years after it launched aim to provide players with an easy way to report it.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/battlefield/battlefield-2042/voice-chat-moderation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s help page</a>, the company said voice chat moderation is used when reviewing reports of “harmful or offensive” voice chat, so its support teams can “action the reports appropriately.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s how it works: when you report a player, EA’s support team automatically receives a recording of the session you wish to report. Then, after evaluating the recording, the support team will make a decision according to EA’s Positive Play Charter and “enforce a solution.”</p><p>As outlined by EA, here’s how to report someone through Battlefield 2042’s Squad and Players list:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Open the Pause menu.</li><li>Choose Squad and Players.</li><li>Select the player’s name on the list.</li><li>Choose More.</li><li>If you want to report them, select Report.</li><li>Select Abusive Voice Chat.</li></ul><p>If you just want to block the player, follow the same steps above, select Block, and then confirm when you’re asked to. Blocked players are also muted for you in voice and text chat.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can’t turn voice chat moderation off, but you <em>can</em> choose not to use voice chat when you play. EA said this is “to protect players.”</p><p>The expectation is this new voice chat moderation feature will be used in future Battlefield games. In April, EA announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-season-7-motive-connected-battlefield-universe">Battlefield 2042 Season 7 is officially its last</a>, with development of the Connected Battlefield Universe now in full swing. Battlefield general manager Byron Beede explained that it's time for the franchise to "turn from the present to the future." To that end, he said, EA would continue to support Battlefield 2042 with "in-game challenges, events, modes, and of course, ongoing maintenance," but would move away from a seasonal structure when Season 7 wraps up this month.</p><p>Season 7 marks the end of Battlefield 2042's comeback trail after its disappointing release back in 2021, which saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review"><u>fans and critics pan its 128-player matches and its Specialist system</u></a>, among other things. In the years since it has managed to rehabilitate its reputation somewhat, though it still sits at Mixed on Steam.</p><p>EA has a number of developers working on future Battlefield projects, including a team at Dead Space remake maker EA Motive, Ripple Effect, DICE, and Criterion.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-zombies-campaign-details/#how-does-black-ops-6-fit-into-warzone" rel="nofollow ">feature from Screenrant</a> reports that Treyarch confirmed Black Ops 6's new movement will also be added to Warzone. Movement is already a huge part of Warzone with features like slide-canceling, so this more advanced system can provide new ways for players to chain together movement and further play their life in battle royale.</p><p>Unfortunately, Treyarch was unable to provide any further details about Black Ops 6's integration with Warzone, but an <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision blog post</a> did confirm the integration will arrive with the Season 1 update. More details about Black Ops 6 multiplayer will arrive during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28, but it's uncertain if this will include any information for Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Here we highlight all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">major announcements from the Black Ops 6 reveal</a>, which includes campaign details, more information on the movement system, and the first look at Zombies mode. Black Ops 6 is also revealed to include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-will-let-players-customize-the-hud-like-never-before/1100-6524099/">more HUD customization than ever before</a>.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-leak-reveals-its-coming-to-game-pass-day-one/1100-6523742/">available on Game Pass</a> for day one.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive (but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-may-update-causes-head-scratching-new-problems/1100-6523649/">rather underwhelming</a>) May update, Bethesda has just released version ​​1.12.30 of the game, known as the June update. Starfield's June update includes a number of features, including new missions, a new bounty-scanning mechanic, and the introduction of the Starfield Creation Kit for all modders (it was previously released for modders hand-picked by Bethesda).</p><p dir="ltr">Sadly, it seems that land vehicles--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">Bethesda confirmed are in development</a> last month--still aren't on the menu (yet). Regardless, the update includes quite a few changes, quality-of-life improvements, and, of course, a good number of bug-fixes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiN5PDu400s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiN5PDu400s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Starfield Creation Kit is now available to all modders, and can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" rel="nofollow ">downloaded on Steam</a>. Players on all platforms can now access Creations, including unique new missions, gear, skins, and weapons, among other content. Creations can be accessed via the game's menu, and Bethesda has a special surprise for certain players: Anyone who ordered the Premium Edition of Starfield will find that 1,000 Creation Credits have been added to their account, free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Two new Tracker's Alliance missions have also been added. The first, called The Starjacker, puts players in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in various parts of The Settled Systems. The second mission, called The Vulture, is a Bethesda Game Studios Creation, meaning it can only be accessed via the Creations menu mentioned above. This new mission will cost real-life cash unless you happen to have received the aforementioned 1,000 Creation Credits for ordering the Special Edition version of Starfield. Both missions see players taking on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">serious bounty-hunting gigs</a> that can end in riches--or disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of bounty-hunting, Starfield's June update introduces a new "bounty scanner" mechanic, which enables players to seek out targets with active bounties on their heads, and dispose of them (or work things out without exchanging gunfire). Using the scanner function, players can now identify targets in crowds of NPCs. Wanted individuals will be highlighted in red, and scanning them directly will reveal their name, the crimes they're wanted for, and how many credits the player will earn for bringing them in. Tracker-loving, trigger-happy players who are especially hungry for bounty-hunting content can also check out the Elite Tracker's Alliance mission board for more heads to hunt.</p><p dir="ltr">There's still no news on when land vehicles will be added to the game, but they're likely to arrive sometime between now and the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-gets-a-trippy-trailer-new-content-launching-today/1100-6524080/">Starfield's upcoming Shattered Space expansion</a>--a DLC focused on an abandoned space station and ancient Va'Ruun secrets--which is scheduled to release sometime this fall.</p><p>The full Starfield version 1.12.30 patch notes are listed below.

The answer to that is…of course! It’s a learning process, just like everything else. It doesn’t happen overnight. I still remember when I didn’t even know the first thing about making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But after some time passed and looking over certain resources again and again, everything started to fall into place…like a game of Tetris, where you have all those falling pieces left and right and must quickly rotate/guide them to those open gaps at the bottom. Your disability, whatever it may be, does not define you. You can be anything you set your mind to, and that includes making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re all different. We do things differently, learn differently, and so on. As long as your heart is in the right place and making video games is your passion, you’ll be making video games in no time! I don’t know everything about making video games (and I never will), but I do know enough to build them from scratch for everyone to enjoy. Some people like my games…some do not, and that’s ok.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is actually one of the things you must be prepared for. Not everybody’s going to like what you make. Any obstacle that comes your way will always be overcome by your love and passion for making video games. It’s like they say: ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Where there’s a will, there’s a way</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’. Life is full of trial and error, especially when it comes to making video games. I make video games, and I have high-functioning autism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That never stopped me from doing what I love. Don’t let it stop you. Do you have a disability? Do you want to make video games? If you’ve answered “yes” to both of these questions, I have one thing to say to you: Go for it! Just remember, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that we’ve spent some in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4’s</a> initial phase, it’s time to gear up for the mid-season update. Here’s when <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded releases, and what to expect.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-start" data-injectable="false">When does MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded start?</h2> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Based on the Battle Pass duration, <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded is expected to come out on June 26, 2024. Although the date and timing have yet to be confirmed, it will likely debut at 9 a.m. PT/11 a.m. CST/12 p.m. EST.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">With the Reloaded patch, the update size should be a manageable amount of space, typically around 18 to 25 GB. A pre-load should be available the day before the launch to ensure you’re fully prepared. This way, you can dive right into the action as soon as it’s live.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded" data-injectable="false">What to expect in MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded </h2> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">The <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone </em><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 roadmap</a> gives us a glimpse into what to expect for its Reloaded release. We’ll break down each category to give you an idea of upcoming features. </p> <h3 id="h-mw3-multiplayer-maps" data-injectable="false">MW3 Multiplayer maps</h3> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer is set to introduce <strong>two new 6v6 core maps: Incline and Das Gross<em>.</em></strong> Incline will take you high above the mountains of Urzikstan in a medium-sized map, perfect for mid-range loadouts. And if that’s not enough, Das Gross will transform Das Haus into an alien nightmare, adding a whole new twist to your gaming experience.</p> <h3 id="h-mw3-game-modes" data-injectable="false">MW3 game modes</h3> <figure data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Havoc mode returns in Season 4 to change up the classic dynamics of Team Deathmatch. You may remember this entry from <em>Modern Warfare 2’s </em>Season 5 launch, where you’ll be rewarded with various modifiers throughout the match. In particular, Operators can equip the Camera Shift ability to change to third-person mode.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Another upcoming game mode will also unleash a new wave of Team Deathmatch content with Headshots Only. The challenge is pretty self-explanatory, in which players can only get kills when aiming for an Operator’s head.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mw3-zombies-unstable-rift" data-injectable="false">MW3 Zombies Unstable Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-zombies-fans-slam-lackluster-season-4-content-worst-update-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not much is planned</a> for <em>MW3 Zombies, </em>as it only features one new challenge. Players can tackle the Unstable Rift Exclusion Zone to earn more rewards and wipe out hordes of zombies. The quest can be replayed as many times as you want, and weapon/schematic cooldowns will be refreshed each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-warzone-weapons-and-events" data-injectable="false">Warzone weapons and events</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone’s </em>Season 4 Reloaded content has been shrouded in mystery, with a few updates garnering a ‘Redacted’ title. What we do know, however, is that rare weaponry will be available in Loot Hot Zones or Bunkers. The guns in question haven’t been revealed yet, so we’ll need to wait until more Reloaded information comes out. Plus, Bunkers will be receiving an update of their own, increasing enemy activity within its radius. </p>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Other than the exclusive weapons, the Runaway Train Public Event will begin during Season 4 Reloaded. Use the train to get around Urzikstan quickly, but be mindful of enemy Operators who also have the same goal in mind.</p> <h3 id="h-new-weaponry" data-injectable="false">New weaponry</h3> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-superi-46-loadout-for-mw3-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Superi 46</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KAR98K</a> have already become some of the most powerful guns in Season 4. However, Reloaded will introduce new weapons that could take over their spot. This includes the Reclaimer 18 Shotgun and Sledgehammer Melee Weapon. While Reclaimer 18 was previously shown in <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Sledgehammer is a brand-new weapon that packs a 20-pound head.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">Other content will presumably arrive for Season 4 Reloaded, but for now, these are the confirmed features from the roadmap. We also can’t forget the upcoming Aftermarket Parts from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-4-week-1-weekly-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Challenges</a>, such as the Jak Volkh, Jak Thumber-656, and Jak Intimidator.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24175322/bungie-destiny-2-frontier-teaser<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie just concluded the long-running saga of the light and darkness in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape </em>earlier this month<em>, </em>and now the <em>Halo </em>and <em>Destiny </em>developer is teasing what’s next. In a “journey ahead” stream today, Bungie disclosed the first details on its plans for the rest of the year ahead with <em>Destiny 2</em> and even teased a 2025 release for new content that’s codenamed “Frontiers.”</p><p>Until Frontiers arrives next year, <em>Destiny 2</em> will continue with new episodes of story content that explore what’s happened after the conclusion of <em>The Final Shape</em>. <em>Destiny 2</em> players have just battled The Witness in the latest expansion, the main antagonist of&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s light and darkness saga, which has created what Bungie is calling echoes throughout the universe. </p><div><figcaption><em>Destiny 2 is getting loot potions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bungie</cite></p></div><p>The first echo has landed on Nessus, which is why <em>Destiny 2</em> players have noticed earthquakes occurring on that planet over the weekend. Nessus is changing, and so are the Vex enemies that inhabit it, which <em>Destiny 2</em> players will start to discover this week as <em>The Final Shape</em> seasonal content begins with this first episode of stories. </p><p>Later in the year, the second echo, Revenant, will see the focus switch to the Fallen enemies, with <em>Destiny 2</em> players turning into vampire hunters that have craftable potions. After Revenant the final episode is Heresy, which will focus on the Hive pantheon enemies. And yes, we’re heading back to the dreadnought to see what’s changed with the Hive. There will even be armor that’s themed around Eris Morn, <em>Destiny</em>’s very own Hive lore expert.</p><p>After Heresy ends and year 11 of <em>Destiny 2</em> begins in 2025, a new “Frontiers” drop of content is on the way. “The journey continues,” teases Bungie. It’s not clear what storyline the Frontiers content will cover, but it doesn’t seem to be the big annual expansion that Bungie typically puts out for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Either way, Bungie is making it clear that <em>Destiny 2</em> isn’t going anywhere just yet, despite speculation over whether or not a <em>Destiny 3</em> is on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="G4PEix">One way to ensure that a favorite show or movie never disappears from streaming rotation? Buy a physical copy. On Monday, the animation distributor GKIDS announced that fans of Netflix’s <em>League of Legends</em> series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24026643/arcane-season-two-netflix-teaser-trailer-release-warwick-singed-riot-games"><em>Arcane</em></a> would soon have that chance, with Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray releases planned for later this year.</p>
<p id="59AXMA">While <em>Arcane</em> carved out backstories for known <em>League of Legends</em> characters Vi and Jinx, the animated series triumphed on Netflix thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22800666/arcane-season-1-review">a tenuous connection to known lore</a> and an emphasis on stylish action and dramatic character work. Produced by the French animation studio Fortiche for Riot Games, the series was a major hit for the streamer, clocking over 34 million hours of viewership in its first week. And based on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix">Netflix’s recent report of 2023 stats</a>, the series is <em>still</em> finding millions of viewers two years later as people wait and/or catch up ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix"><em>Arcane</em> season 2</a>, due out in November. </p>

<p id="pf2jwY">Details are light on what GKIDS might pack into a physical release, but the initial announcement promises “a full product array later this year, ranging from digital to premium editions, including a 4K version exclusive to the home entertainment release.” But in a rare tone for a Blu-ray licensing agreement, the folks at GKIDS seem over the moon to be making a physical edition of the series possible. The news broke out of the Annecy International Animation Festival, where where the distributor also acquired rights to Science Saru’s anime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxXNtfIapqs"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a><em> </em>and a 4K restoration of Mamoru Oshii’s masterpiece <em>Angel’s Egg</em>.</p>
<p id="o27YJN">“We are MONSTER fans of [<em>Arcane</em>],” said GKIDS founder and CEO Eric Beckman in a statement, “and our team is having a blast collaborating with the creatives at Riot and Fortiche to put together an amazing package for the fans. This project was dreamt up on the lawn by the lake at Annecy, so we are extra happy to be able to announce this collaboration at the festival and true home of animation.”</p>
<p id="RRBOgy">There’s no word on when <em>Arcane</em> season 1 will hit Blu-ray, but GKIDS promises more announcements to come later this year.</p>

The latest entry in the supernatural adventure series will return to original protagonist Max Caulfield as she solves the murder of her friend by jumping between alternate timelines. While that’s an exciting prospect for longtime fans, the game has been mired in a bit of controversy as Square Enix has rolled out details about its release plans.<br></p><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Like previous games in the series, <em>Double Exposure </em>will be an episodic game. However, it won’t be rolling out periodically like the first few games did, and will instead follow <em>True Colors</em>’ format of releasing all the episodes at once. Well, with one catch. The game’s $80 Ultimate Edition will let you play the first two chapters on October 15, two weeks before the game’s October 29 release date. Fans are criticizing this decision (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>) both because it’s incentivizing players to pay up for early access and because it will open up fans who can’t afford or don’t want to pay extra to spoilers for two weeks. The move would almost feel like an homage to the original game’s structure if it wasn’t also kinda gross.</p><p>“I feel like Square Enix locked this awesome feature behind a paywall,” upper_camel_case wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>. “[Episodic releasing] made the original <em>Life Is Strange</em> such a great experience when it originally released. Now only the people who are willing to pay a lot of money for something they don’t know if it’s even good are going to be able to experience it. They are preying on the most devoted fans. Not nice.”</p><p>It’s clear Square Enix is banking on FOMO to get people to fork over the extra $30, as even their marketing copy on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span> highlights how this lets people be part of the discussion around Max’s latest story.</p><p>“Don’t miss your chance to join the conversation around this unforgettable supernatural murder mystery,” the Steam page reads.</p><p><em>Double Exposure </em>isn’t the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357">only video game in the world</a></span> that lets people pay more to play early, but two weeks is a much larger head start than these arrangements usually allow for. However, it does have the advantage of not being an online game like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> which had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239">server trouble during this early access period</a></span>, rendering it useless after all that money spent. The trade-off is that, inevitably, someone will get spoiled on those first two episodes because they can’t justify the cost. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all this, <em>Double Exposure </em>is also falling into another tiresome modern video game release trend in that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$60 “collector’s edition”</a></span> doesn’t actually contain a copy of the game. There’s some neat stuff in the package, including a vinyl soundtrack and artbook, but Square Enix’s store page puts in big red letters that the actual <em>Double Exposure</em> game is sold separately. If you want both this big box of goodies <em>and</em> to see Max’s next chapter unfold, you’ll have to fork over an extra $50 (or $80, if you want the early access). Honestly, a $110 collector’s edition isn’t even that expensive by modern standards, but the unnecessary obtuseness in how it’s sold is the issue. Collector’s Editions that are just boxes of swag that don’t include the game aren’t actually “editions” of the game at all.<br></p><p>Ultimately these are big company decisions separate from whether <em>Double Exposure </em>will be any good or not, but it’s not the best look for a game that’s clearly banking on fans’ love for the 2015 original. The <em>Life is Strange </em>series has become known for hopping between protagonists at this point and going back to Max is likely to draw back in old fans, so it’s a shame it has this weighing it down right out the gate. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bungie released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PYzMqhu3Fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“journey ahead” trailer</a> today, announcing that Destiny 2 Codename Frontiers will arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer does not confirm an exact release date for Frontiers. Instead, it simply teases that “the journey continues.” So, that remains the biggest reveal for Year 11 today.</p>



<p>However, the new Destiny 2 trailer also reveals new footage for Year 10 episodes. These will include Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy. </p>



<p>Bungie showcased gameplay and concept art alongside developer narration. However, much of the footage added a disclaimer that it remains in-progress, and it is still subject to change.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-to-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay that lasted months</a>, Bungie finally released Destiny 2’s The Final Shape DLC last week. It is the culmination of years of storytelling, an epic conclusion for the Light and Darkness saga.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Sony itself appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-dlc-leaks-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak The Final Shape content early</a>, including the entire campaign. </p>



<p>The Final Shape DLC ultimately earned decent ratings, and currently holds a 7.2 user score on Metacritic. It adds new collections, weapons, story, and more.</p>



<p>Recent rumors from April 2024 suggest that Bungie could be working on Destiny 3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-possibly-developing-destiny-3-under-codename-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the codename Payback</a>. Paul Tassi of Forbes commented on an old, notable post from Reddit, though Tassi did not confirm the rumor outright.</p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Bungie also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-cheat-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a key lawsuit</a> against cheat provider Phoenix Digital.</p>

                <p>During last year's Gamescom, Tripwire announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-revealed-during-opening-night-live-with-gruesome-trailer/1100-6517080/" data-ref-id="1100-6517080">Killing Floor 3</a> will revive the long-dormant action and horror FPS franchise. Now, a new Killing Floor 3 gameplay trailer has revealed a look at the upgraded Zeds that are awaiting gamers. These monstrous creations are several generations ahead of the Zeds seen in Killing Floor 2. This time, the Zeds are more heavily armed and they're also able to fight as an army instead of a mindless horde.</p><p>The trailer also reintroduces Mr. Foster and his Nightfall commandos as they attack an army depot that has been taken over by Zed forces. Mr. Foster even seems to revel in the opportunity to destroy these creatures.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Tripwire has set Killing Floor 3's story in 2091, seven decades after Killing Floor 2. The Zeds have been nearly perfected by Megacorp Horzine, and the Nightfall team might be the only thing standing between these creatures and the rest of humanity. Fortunately for players, the Nightfall team has a few new tricks of their own including specialized weapons, the ability to climb and dash, and new environmental traps that can be laid down to devastate the Zeds.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 will be available on PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> has plenty of iconic maps, but perhaps none are more popular than Nuketown. While it was always expected that it would arrive in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops 6</em> at some point, eagle eyes have already spotted in the game ahead of release. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">During the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> reveal at <em>Call of Duty Direct</em>, Treyarch gave us not only a glimpse at the game’s new movement features and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-finally-ends-the-round-based-zombies-map-drought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round-based Zombies</a> but also showed off an early look at the UI. As spotted by CharlieIntel, in the corner of the lobby UI, we can see the game loading into a match on Nuketown, confirming that the map is coming this fall. </p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Nuketown has been a feature in the <em>Black Ops</em> series since 2010 when it first appeared in the first entry of the series. It’s returned in every Treyarch-developed game ever since. With five appearances in mainline <em>CoD</em> games, and also a cameo in <em>CoD: Mobile</em>, it was almost guaranteed that it would be in <em>BO6</em>, but it’s still nice to know it’s happening. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">It’s no surprise that it’s coming back though, as it’s <em>CoD</em>‘s most popular map. In <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Nuketown 24/7 playlist was one of the game’s most played and is just match after match played on the map over and over again. In fact, when Treyarch did remove the mode for a period, fans spent the entire time asking when it was coming back. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that we’ll be able to play it at release, as Treyarch has said the game will launch with 16 new maps, which Nuketown definitely is not. In my opinion, Nuketown is the perfect map to drop with the game’s first seasonal update, along with a new weapon and likely the <em>Black Ops 6</em> patch for <em>Warzone</em>. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">A true fan-favorite, I personally can’t wait to get back on Nuketown, as it’s often the map I play the most. If you’re ranking up guns or trying to complete camo challenges, Nuketown 24/7 playlists promise lots of gunfights in a small location, making it perfect for grinding your way through the progression system. </p>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">We’ll be sure to keep you updated as we learn more about Nuketown’s introduction to <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

<p id="7pof2s">Following up George Mann’s <em>The Eye of Darkness</em>, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> reunites the Jedi of the High Republic Era after the marauder-terrorist group known as the Nihil staged a violent takeover of a portion of the Outer Rim known as the Occlusion Zone. Focused on the reunion of star-crossed Jedi Avar Kriss and Elzar Mann, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> promises to pay off some long-simmering character work while rallying for what ought to be an explosive conclusion in next spring’s <em>Trials of the Jedi</em> by Charles Soule. </p>
<p id="eA7nhx">In this exclusive excerpt from <em>Temptation of the Force</em>, ahead of its debut on June 11, we see the beginning of the Jedi’s offensive against the Nihil — one that doesn’t involve weapons of warfare, but words of inspiration. </p>
<hr id="k2GELT">
<p id="L6Ubw1"><em><strong>While the Jedi take the fight directly to the Nihil, within the Occlusion Zone, a group of freedom fighters work to support the planets imprisoned in Nihil space, spreading a message of hope and freedom. </strong></em></p>
<h2 id="HEF0ES"><strong>RILIAS II, INSIDE THE OCCLUSION ZONE</strong></h2>
<p id="5FKYvS">Cair San Tekka had been a lot of things in his relatively short life: a spy, a musician, a secret husband, a security aide, a secretary, a punk kid, a troublemaker, a pilot, and now a smuggler and freedom fighter. He wasn’t the only one running various rebellions throughout Nihil space, and several such rebel groups had found ways to access the constantly changing anti-scav codes to allow for safer travel out here on the frontier, as well as a comm subroutine channel that made it through the Nihil comm embargo. Cair managed those things, too. But what he had that nobody else had was someone who provided him with frequently updated time-phased Path codes that could be used by the Jedi to penetrate the Stormwall. </p>
<p id="fx1oOY">And allies with ships of their own. </p>

</p>
<p id="ycRPKL">Those ships were what allowed Cair to be down in the central water garden of Rilias II, huddled in the bowl of their foris alloy funnel. The funnel had been built a few generations ago as a decorative fountain the size of a small building, out of a metal mined on one of their moons that allowed for an exact resonance with the minerals found in their perma-scatter clouds. The funnel gathered thin trickles of water all day and night from the water garden, and at sunrise and sunset most days of the year, when the light filtered through the clouds, it hit the alloy funnel. The funnel’s reverberation caused particles in the air to vibrate into little rainbow stars. </p>
<p id="tglXni">It also amplified certain audio frequencies. </p>
<p id="KLVcmd">Cair shifted the strap of his harness to better reach the small panel that was part of the controls in the base of the funnel. He balanced against the sloped, slippery wall with his feet and worked quickly to remove a datachip and replace it with his sliced frequency emitter. </p>
<p id="Lc9r7c">This would be the fifth morale drop he’d personally led, but the first that included a visual component. </p>
<p id="YaiwhU">Ever since he’d met up with Rhil Dairo last month, she’d been angling to find a way to include visuals in their drops. Symbols and smiles, she’d insisted again and again. Cair hadn’t disagreed with the sentiment, only the practicality. </p>
<p id="TP7GRB">But today they had means and opportunity. </p>
<p id="a6irLq">It was a three-pronged setup: Cair down here slicing the funnel to match the necessary frequencies, Rhil up in orbit with the <em>Brightbird</em>— or as it was known in these parts, the Nihil transport <em>Blood Vulture</em>— and Belin ready in his ship on the other side of the sparkling felsic cliffs edging the city. Rhil had dropped the refitted comm buoy with her newest broadcast, active to the frequencies Cair matched with the funnel, and Belin would fly over the city, releasing a hydro-spray to activate the clouds prematurely. Then their show would begin. </p>
<p id="GpQY8q">Cair finished his slice and hit the countdown monitor he’d brought. It synced up with the similar countdown embedded in his artificial hand. He grinned. So far, so good. </p>
<p id="q2a1jp">Climbing out of the funnel took a bit of time, but Cair hooked his legs over the edge and found a seat on a broad ruffled lily pad. He leaned back on the soft moss and tilted his head up. The teal sky was striped by thin blushing scatter clouds, and every once in a while, a personal shuttle zipped past.</p>
<p id="SIENko">Rilias II had been hard hit by the Nihil, but its central government had capitulated faster than many, giving in to demands for total surrender and allowing regular Nihil rioting missions under the cover of “tax collecting.” Neighborhoods had been razed and anybody who fought back taken into custody or killed. It was a horribly typical story of the past year in the Occlusion Zone, but thanks to quick thinking or cowardly leaders, enough of the populace and riches had been sacrificed to semi-mollify the Nihil. </p>
<p id="uluPQv">That just made Cair’s job more important. He had to remind people they needed to fight. And they could survive. There was hope. It was worth reaching out, worth trying. Everybody needed to be trying. </p>
<p id="Pu0fZC">The water garden shuddered under him as the city’s inner mechanisms opened the underground rivers. It was nearly time. </p>
<p id="HFCyyP">Cair tried not to feel too deeply about the moment of peace. Waiting was the only peace he got these days. The peace between planning and action. </p>
<p id="8b40JB">As always, he pretended he could feel the Force thrumming through everything, connecting him to the lily pad and water, to the air and atmosphere, to his allies in their positions, to the stars beyond, to his family—all of whom were in Republic space now, thank the Force. Cair wasn’t strong in the Force in the least, but he’d been raised to trust it anyway. Sometimes he pretended so well he could actually feel it in his bones. </p>
<p id="ZMq0Yf">The countdown alert notified him he had a minute, and Cair got up onto his feet. He stood at the edge of the funnel as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Security teams—the local constabulary indebted to the Nihil now and oppressed by them—could see him if they looked. If Cair was seen, he might be shot on sight. Or he might be cheered. </p>
<p id="njteCJ">But Cair felt deeply that he needed to be seen. Somebody would tell the story: A human had been here and caused this disruption. Not from space, not from the distance beyond the Stormwall. Someone here. In the flesh. Risking death and torture to bring them this message.</p>
<p id="unuiPs">Cair stood, ignoring the fear. This was worth being afraid. Worth death. It had to be. He’d spent too much of his life serving only his family’s benefit, making underhanded business deals instead of music, toying with industrial espionage instead of new wavelengths for his dulcimer. He was good at creating trouble and spycraft, and he’d never regretted prioritizing what his uncles and parents pushed him toward. Until he met somebody even better at such games, and married him. </p>
<p id="HZwSvu">Of course, with the Nihil occupation, nothing was a game anymore. Cair had done his best to lay low, help those he could, and keep himself from putting a target on his husband’s back. He hadn’t known what else <em>to </em>do. </p>
<p id="5V4sxs">Now he knew. </p>
<p id="KMRCkI">He’d seen people sacrifice everything to keep their families alive. He’d witnessed far-flung San Tekkas disregard profit and exploration and everything Cair thought made San Tekkas San Tekkas just to save a handful of people in danger. They’d been more than brave, risked everything, left it all behind, not for glory or profit but for <em>hope. </em>He’d lost his hand learning to make the same choice. </p>
<p id="BXefUs">It still wasn’t easy to do. But every time Cair chose hope, it got a little less scary. </p>
<p id="ugydwY">Warm wind brushed strands of messy black hair across his face. He made himself smile. That would be the last thing he did, if it was the last thing he did. His dramatic husband would say, <em>Running should be the last thing you do, you fool. </em></p>
<p id="Eg2yFW">Cair heard the high scream of Belin’s engine before he saw the glint of the ship out at the line of felsic cliffs. </p>
<p id="JAba7r">It was time. </p>
<p id="a1Btfd">Cair twisted a tiny red dial on his black-metal hand, and it snapped with a frequency. The funnel hummed in answer. </p>
<p id="LMkQd5">The rest was up to Rhil and Belin. </p>
<p id="LM7hmx">Suddenly Rhil’s voice blasted throughout the sky: “Greetings, free citizens of the frontier! This is your friend and ally Rhil Dairo, and today we have a message from a hero you all know!”</p>
<p id="KuTYQl">Cair laughed. Rhil’s broadcast would travel from buoy to buoy until the Nihil managed to stop it. </p>
<p id="HxI2Ap">The funnel thrummed harder, and there came Belin, streaking across the sky in his sharp-nosed shuttle. Behind him trailed a shimmer as the hydro-spray clung to the lower atmosphere, ready. </p>
<p id="An3wEZ">Cair raised a hand to Belin, who vanished over the distant horizon. </p>
<p id="6ZZyzo">The spray caught the sunlight and the funnel flared. </p>
<p id="R1ccHV">“Hello, this is Jedi Master Avar Kriss,” the Jedi’s voice rang out. </p>
<p id="a1i8t1">Everywhere in this system, and hopefully the neighboring as well, and in every Nihil ship and city with comms that could be reached, Avar Kriss spoke to those listening. </p>
<p id="MAVbZF">But here on Rilias II, held in shape by the rainbow frequencies of the alloy funnel, Avar Kriss’s face looked down like a god. </p>
<p id="Lg09qn">If Cair knew Jedi at all, he knew she’d hate the comparison. But Cair relished it. He grinned and laughed again. And before he hightailed it to his mark to be picked up in a hurry, he stood there, watching and listening. </p>
<p id="4rBwG5">“I bring a message of hope, though it is difficult to hear. But listen, please. Even I am familiar with despair. I know it. That feeling when everything is too much, when the pressure of looking for anything inside of tomorrow is overwhelming. It hurts. I know it, too. In times like that just remember who you are—who you want to be. Who you can be. Focus on that. Fight with me, if that is who you can be. But if you cannot, you do not have to fight. I won’t ask that of you. There are people already fighting for you. For all of us. All I am asking of you today is that you live. Live today, and try to find hope tomorrow. This is Jedi Master Avar Kriss. Help is on the way.”</p>

<p>A new version of Microsoft's top-end Xbox Series X will launch without a disc drive for the first time this holiday season.</p>
<p>The new "Digital Edition" console option—which sports 1TB of storage and an Xbox Series S-like "Robot White" color scheme—will be available "in select markets" for an estimated retail price of $449 (or 500 euros). That price is just $50 less than the MSRP for the current, disc-drive-equipped Xbox Series X, which is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x/8wj714n3rbtl">currently on sale for $449 from the Microsoft Store</a>.</p>
<p>Word of Microsoft's plans for a disc-drive-free Xbox Series X <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">first leaked last September</a> as part of the Federal Trade Commission's case against the Microsoft/Activision merger. But the new disc-free Series X bears little resemblance to the cylindrical "Brooklin" refresh shown in those leaked promo materials, which also touted redesigned internals and improved power usage. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">said at the time</a> that "so much has changed" from the "old emails and documents" in those leaks.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The new Digital Edition Series X will seemingly be on store shelves alongside the standard edition, meaning that Microsoft is not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/is-the-world-ready-for-a-disc-free-game-console/">moving away from disc-based games entirely</a> just yet. To the contrary, a new "Galaxy Black" Xbox Series X model with a disc drive and 2TB of storage is also planned to launch "in limited quantities" this holiday season at a price of $600. That makes the new hardware slightly cheaper than buying a current Xbox Series X and adding on 1TB of expansion storage <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/hard-drives/seagate-expansion-card">for about $150</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also planning a holiday launch for a version of its 1TB edition of the Xbox Series S in Robot White, supplementing the "Carbon Black" version that launched last September. Both colors will be available for $349.</p>

<p>Alongside the weekend hardware announcements, Xbox President Sarah Bond vaguely asserted that they were "hard at work on the next generation" of Xbox hardware and will be "pushing the technical boundaries in our future hardware."</p>

                <p>Rumors have swirled about a handheld Xbox console for years, but none of them have ever quite panned out. At this year's Xbox Game Showcase, Xbox chief Phil Spencer made his feelings on the matter clear. Asked about the concept in a recent interview, Spencer simply said: "I think we should have a handheld."</p><p dir="ltr">While that statement--given in a discussion with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto&amp;t=1540s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>--appears to speak for itself, Spencer quickly stated that the interviewer will also have to speak to Sarah Bond, the president of Xbox, on the issue. He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto">expressed positive feelings</a> about the future of Xbox hardware, calling it "pretty awesome," and that he's excited to talk about "different form factors" in that hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer's response falls short of an official announcement of an Xbox handheld, but it would certainly seem to indicate that the company is headed in that direction. However, what form it might take remains to be seen. In that same interview, Spencer addressed the closure of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">several Microsoft-owned game studios</a> earlier this year, including Tango Gameworks, calling it "a decision that is very hard on those teams" and stating that he "has to run a sustainable business inside the company."</p><p dir="ltr">The success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">Steam Deck</a> and similar devices has triggered a renaissance in portable gaming over the past few years, which may have prompted Xbox to seriously consider releasing a portable console. Sony's PlayStation Portal has also enjoyed strong sales, and it's possible that Xbox might differentiate its console by offering local play (rather than remote-only). That said, Xbox did announce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-announces-new-all-digital-xbox-series-x/1100-6524077/" data-ref-id="1100-6524077">new hardware</a> at the showcase in the form of an all-digital Xbox Series X, which is all-white and has no disk drive. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">report from earlier this year</a> suggested that Microsoft was working on an Xbox handheld prototype, and it's apparently similar to the Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/#3">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, check out our recap.

        <p>App store has launched with six games, including Word Jungle and Condor – A Leap of Faith</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Independent app store Aptoide has launched on iOS in Europe after the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">Digital Markets Act was introduced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/03/aptoide-launches-its-alternative-ios-game-store-in-eu/">TechCrunch</a>, the store launched last Thursday with six titles including Word Jungle, Condor – A Leap of Faith, and Charades Guess the Word.</p>
<p>Over 100 developers have cited interest on Aptoide so far, in addition to a waitlist of 20,000 users. Between 500 and 1,000 access codes will be distributed daily to enable the app to control growth and receive feedback.</p>
<p>Aptoide also has an alternative in-app purchase solution for iOS, and offers a IAP software development kit for game developers and users launched in collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>"The Aptoide iOS game store represents a significant shift in the way users and developers interact with the iOS gaming ecosystem," said company co-founder and CEO Paulo Trezentos.</p>
<p>"It marks a significant departure from the traditional iOS gaming ecosystem, which has been controlled by Apple's App Store. We thank Apple for their support thus far, knowing that there are still areas for improvement in the alternative distribution of iOS apps.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic that, with continued cooperation from Apple and regulators, the business terms and user experience will continue to be improved in the coming months."</p>
<p>Aptoide will only focus on games for now, but may expand to other services on iOS in the future as Trezentos told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/4/24171037/aptoide-ios-game-store-eu-third-party-app-dma">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s all-new <em>The Final Shape</em> DLC is, in many ways, a showcase of everything this franchise could be at its absolute best. Some of its new systems, however, are still rather untested, with players being unsure what to make of them. Take the new Pathfinder system, for example.</p> <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">After you’ve taken down <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-defeat-the-witness-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the big bad of the DLC (for the first time)</a> and begun engaging with <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-patrols-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-campaign progression systems</a>, you will inevitably come across one of the several new Pathfinder interfaces strewn across the Director UI. Pathfinder is a one-size-fits-all Bounty replacement, providing a clear and pointed look at certain loot and currency items to prioritize. As shown in the screenshot below, it’s a neat and traditionally beautiful interface that sadly still needs work to truly come into its own. Here’s a brief rundown on why, and more of an in-depth look at how <em>The Final Shape’s Pathfinder </em>loot system works. <br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-finale-shape-s-pathfinder-loot-system-explained" data-injectable="false">The Finale Shape’s Pathfinder loot system explained</h2> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s new Pathfinder feature gives you a wide overview of how to progress through your active Season Pass, earn a fair chunk of snazzy loot, and a non-insignificant amount of currency. You do so by completing your randomized array of objectives from left to right, and depending on which Pathfinder you open up, you’ll either be looking at location-specific objectives (i.e. Pale Heart missions) or activity-based ones, instead.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">The good news is that Pathfinder saddles you with an impressively large number of different objectives. the Pale Heart Pathfinder specifically, for example, will send you off to take down world bosses, complete Lost Sectors, take down enemies in a particular way, help Ghosts in their plight, and a whole roster of other missions. It’s all good fun, especially when you can just complete one objective after the other without leaving the location at all.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The bad news, however, is that the activity Pathfinder handles this insistence on variety in a different way, and you’ll often need to jump from one playlist to the other to clear your tasks. In effect, this means you’ll often <em>have</em> to play PvP and/or Gambit PvPvE matches to actually unlock your Pathfinder Engrams.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Another slight downside to the Pathfinder loot system is that it’s not immediately obvious where to find it. Each interface is located in a different spot on the UI, so the Pale Heart’s Pathfinder is found in the upper left corner of the Pale Heart’s Director map, while the activity Pathfinder is in the Vanguard Director UI.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, only the Pale Heart and the core playlist activities have their own respective Pathfinders, but the system seems too comprehensive not to be applied to most major content releases moving forward. I recommend getting used to it, with that in mind. As outlined in the featured Reddit post, many players are still unsure how to feel about Pathfinder as a whole, but Bungie is bound to tune it up as time goes on, so improvements <em>should</em> be coming down the line.</p>

In much the same way as <em>The Final Shape</em> re-envisions tired old <em>Destiny</em> gameplay tropes, so too do Traveler’s Blessings find a new way to give you boons on the go. The bit that makes these destination mods interesting, for example, is that they’re quite powerful <em>but</em> also timed, which means you need to make good use of them while they’re active. Here’s how they work.</p>
  <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Destiny2-Final-Shape-Travelers-Blessings-Interface.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <h2 id="h-traveler-s-blessings-in-the-final-shape-dlc" data-injectable="false">Traveler’s Blessings in The Final Shape DLC</h2> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="941" data-injectable="true">There’s a grand total of 16 unique Traveler’s Blessing mods to be found while <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-patrols-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploring the new Pale Heart location</a> in <em>Destiny 2</em>. Compared to most other destination mods we’ve seen in the past, they are often <em>extremely</em> powerful, offering effects such as the ability to spawn explosive Void seekers on Void-damage kills. Since they’re timed, of course, this has allowed Bungie to be more experimental in what it does to balance these out. Further, Traveler’s Blessings are available exclusively while exploring the Pale Heart, meaning their effects will not be relevant in the grander <em>Destiny 2</em> gameplay sandbox.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">You can find Traveler’s Blessings simply by interacting with the Pale Heart in as many ways as possible: complete mission objectives, open chests, collect the local resource nodes, and so on. Mods will drop at random, which means there’s no way of knowing which ones of these you may or may not get.</p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">Traveler’s Blessings are separated into two eight-item categories: the Flickering Blessings and the Pale Blessings. Flickering mods are player-applied, in that they only come into picture if the player triggers them to cause an effect in combat. Pale mods, on the other hand, are applied by interacting with the Traveler’s Flowers strewn across the Pale Heart, and they incur various survival and ability boons.</p>
 <h3 id="h-all-flickering-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Flickering Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"> <li>Traveler’s Animus: Defeating a combatant has a chance to drop an Orb of Power or a random elemental Orb.</li> <li>Traveler’s Fervor: Sliding after sprinting for a short time sends out a burning line of fire in front of you, dealing Solar damage and incurring Scorched to affected enemies.</li> <li>Traveler’s Abundance: Defeating combatants with grenades has a chance to spawn Special ammo; defeating combatants with Super damage has a chance to spawn Heavy ammo.</li> <li>Traveler’s Transference: Sprinting for a short time applies Amplified; dealing melee damage to combatants while Amplified creates area-of-effect lightning bolts.</li> <li>Traveler’s Multiplicity: Finisher final blows convert your thrown grenade into an additional frag grenade.</li> <li>Traveler’s Diffraction: Defeating combatants with Void damage has a chance to spawn Void seeker rounds that seek out, damage, and Suppress other combatants.</li> <li>Traveler’s Proliferation: Defeating combatants with Strand damage spawns Threadlings; defeating Powerful combatants spawns multiple Threadlings at once.</li> <li>Traveler’s Sublimation: Rapidly defeating combatants with Stasis damage spawns a Stasis mine that damages and Freezes nearby combatants.</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-pale-blessings-in-the-pale-heart" data-injectable="false">All Pale Blessings in the Pale Heart</h3> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"> <li>Traveler’s Grace: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain the effect of another Traveler’s Blessing for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Insight: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Super ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Valor: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Melee ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Facet: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased class ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Resurgence: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased Grenade ability regeneration.</li> <li>Traveler’s Aegis: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain a regenerating Overshield for a limited time.</li> <li>Traveler’s Remedy: Upon interacting with a Traveler’s Flower, gain increased health regeneration for a limited time.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">Each mod comes with its own timer, wherein some last 10 or 11 hours, while others might only stick around for 3 or 4 hours at a time. This, combined with the Traveler’s Blessings’ random drop nature is likely what has allowed Bungie to make them as potent as they are. So, make sure to use them when you’ve got ’em!</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">My recommendation is to activate one of each of these mods whenever you’re going off to try and farm Pale Heart gear, as it’s bound to make the whole thing that much easier for the next couple of hours. Provided, of course, that you actually <em>lean</em> into the active Traveler’s Blessings in the first place!</p>

            <p>
Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has announced a four-year licensing partnership with The Premier League.
</p>
<p>
It means, for the first time ever, Football Manager players will be able to take their team to the top of English football, with all 20 clubs fully licensed including official logos, kits, and player photos.
</p>
<p>
The deal will begin with the 2024/25 season, due later this year.

<p>
"Since Football Manager's inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we're delighted to announce today that at last we are", said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.
</p>
<p>
"The partnership isn't just about the huge in-game benefits it'll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we're enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.
</p>
<p>
"We are very grateful to the Premier League and their other partners in our space for enabling us to be an officially licensed product of the world's most commercially successful football league."
</p>
<p>
Premier League chief commercial officer Will Brass added: "Football Manager has been a big part of the sporting landscape for decades, and is loved and enjoyed by millions of fans around the world. We are thrilled that the Premier League will now feature even more prominently in the game, helping to deliver a deeper, more authentic experience for anybody who takes on the challenge of managing a Premier League club."
</p>
<p>
Football Manager first released in 2005, after its previous iteration as Championship Manager that began in 1992. It's surprising, therefore, it's taken so long for The Premier League to be officially licensed.
</p>
<p>
"What should be a transitional year for Football Manager feels like a quietly revolutionary one, thanks to a handful of little changes with big impacts," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-2024-review">Eurogamer's Football Manager 2024 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-nintendo-direct-this-week-journalist-claims-said-to-air-later-this-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There won't be a Nintendo Direct broadcast this week, a known Brazilian Journalist has claimed.</p>
<p>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, Nintendo won't be airing a new Direct episode later this week. Luckily for Nintendo fans, however, there will be a new Nintendo Direct later this month.<br>
At least, that's what known Brazilian journalist @phluttilippe <a href="https://x.com/phluttilippe/status/1800044165394497990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on X earlier today. Although the journalist has claimed that the Direct will take place by the end of the month, the exact date for the broadcast isn't certain at this point. "There is no Nintendo Direct this week", the journalist wrote on X (Google translated). "End of the month, and as far as I know, the exact date isn't even certain yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo President Furukawa confirmed that there will be a Direct broadcast this month. During this event, Nintendo won't be talking about the Switch 2. "We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation", Furukawa said last month.</p>
<p>While this isn't a confirmation that there indeed won't be a Direct this week, the journalist has correctly revealed Nintendo-related details before official announcements in the past. Also, @phluttilippe was among the first to say that the Switch successor is slated for a release in March 2025, instead of this year. Of course, Nintendo has yet to officially unveil the Switch successor, but Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Furukawa recently confirmed that the Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a> (before the end of Nintendo's current fiscal year, which runs through March 2025).</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Nintendo's plans for this month. Stay tuned.</p>

Harm to Snake’s body, including bruises and bullet wounds, as well as damage to his clothes, will be reflected in real time. “Any injuries to his actual body will leave their mark permanently,” reads the blurb, “telling a story of each player’s unique journey through the game.”</p><p>Despite the jokes about how messed up you will be able to make Snake look by the end of the game, players are genuinely excited about the feature, and especially how it feels so fitting to the franchise’s odd choices. <em>MGS</em> games are known for their weird design flourishes that seemingly have no real purpose beyond complexity. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> you can watch a cup of ice melt in real-time, and in the original <em>MGS3</em> you could win a fight against an aging sniper, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921">The End</a></span>, by simply waiting seven real-world days for him to die of old age. As absurd as these features may sometimes seem, they always add to the depth and immersion of the world. The upgraded damage system of <em>MGS Delta</em> feels like a logical next step for the series, and many see it as a truly Kojima-level choice.</p><p>As for how far the new damage system will go, Konami hasn’t given details on what to expect beyond what’s explained in the short blurb on the website. My best guess is that all damage taken by Snake will be able to be healed (this is a video game after all) but will leave a lasting scar, eventually creating a tapestry of mistakes or close calls with death unique to you. Maybe death will leave an exceptionally deep scar on Snake to remind you of when and why you failed. In any case, it’s a fascinating tease of what’s to come in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-veterans-announce-copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-and-the-first-from-new-studio-triple-espresso.896787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Triple Espresso, a brand new game development studio consisting of industry veterans, has announced its first title: <em>Copa City</em>. This game takes football management in a new direction, having you control everything about the city hosting the biggest clubs and matches in the world. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> combines the strategic elements of a tycoon simulator with the electric themes of football to create something that feels altogether new and interesting, much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-football-manager-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager</a></em> did when the very first entry was released. Just to be clear, this is soccer for you US folks, meaning you’ll be looking after all the hosting requirements and city management that come with major Premier League games and much from the same sport. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triple Espresso</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> is currently slated for a 2025 release window and is being developed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. During the campaign, you’ll manage real-world cities and six fully licensed football clubs playing in them. The clubs include Arsenal FC, FC Bayern Munchen, and CR Flamengo, so definitely some of the bigger names out there. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Your overarching goal with every match is to help the city gear up for the event and even get excited about it. This includes organizing how roadblocks must be set up, advertising, where fans can sit, and more. It reminds me a lot of the final match Leicester had to play in the Premier League in the 2015/16 season. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">The team was going to win the league regardless of the outcome, but more people watched it and were excited about it and the ensuring victory parade that occurred after than I’ve ever seen before. Everyone was talking about it, but the amount of management that must have gone into organizing every aspect of the match and everything that followed must have been monumental. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">I believe that’s the goal of <em>Copa City</em>: to put you in the shoes of the people working to facilitate that excitement in the best ways possible. You have all the responsibilities that come with keeping people and businesses in the city safe without all the team management, but you’re also rooting for one particular outcome so you can put on a fantastic show. </p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">The game is being developed by veterans from across the industry who have worked on titles such as <em>Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Dying Light 2</em>, and <em>Pure Farming 2018</em>, as well as football experts who have a wealth of knowledge to make the experience feel great for fans of football and strategy games alike. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://copacity.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copa City</a></em> is entering a space that the <em>Football Manager</em> and, to a degree, <em>EA Sports FC</em> have owned for over a decade. It’ll be interesting to see if it resonates with fans and can make a dent where fans love stats and want more management options at their fingertips. </p>
