IKEA just recently posted a TikTok with some very familiar sights and sounds, and it has us hoping for a furniture collaboration soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ikea-collab/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the official TikTok page for IKEA France <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-93JTvzdyqdS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a video</a> two days ago that very much seems to be teasing something Animal Crossing-related. In the video, a very distinctively Animal Crossing leaf floats down from the ceiling of an empty room, before a hand cursor clicks on it and turns it into furniture, cycling through four different types of IKEA furniture (two bookcases in different styles, a dresser, and a couch). The video description, via TikTok's translation from French, reads, "We still don't accept cash bells. #ikea #animalcrossing"</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance/video/7597860813692472608" data-video-id="7597860813692472608"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ikeafrance?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ikeafrance" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ikeafrance</a> On n'accepte toujours pas les clochettes en caisse. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ikea?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="ikea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ikea</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/animalcrossing?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" title="animalcrossing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#animalcrossing</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-IKEA-France-7597860865366412064?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ son original  - IKEA France" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ son original  - IKEA France</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The background music, while not identifiable immediately as any specific Animal Crossing theme, certainly has the correct xylophone and according sounds going. And the sound effects of clicking and cycling between furniture are 100% straight from Animal Crossing. To me, that reads that whatever's going on here at minimum has Nintendo's blessing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/23/screenshot-2026-01-24-09-49-28-1769201445843.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image courtesy of KBABZ</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, IKEA and Nintendo have collaborated on Animal Crossing stuff before.

IKEA has also done proper in-game collaborations with games like The Sims in the past, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to see something like IKEA furniture in Animal Crossing, or Animal Crossing furniture sold at IKEA. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm all on board of this means we get Blåhaj in Animal Crossing, or a real-life Froggy Chair.

    <article>
      <p>I first played mech-based tactics game <em>Phantom Brigade</em> back in 2019 when it was in Early Access on the Epic Games Store, then<a href="https://kotaku.com/phantom-brigade-a-new-turn-based-tactics-game-rules-1845710612?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>I reviewed it</u></a> when it hit 1.0 in 2023. Now here I am, in January 2026, somehow writing about the game <em>again</em>, because it's managed the rare feat of getting a <em>2.0</em> release.</p><p>I thought the 1.0 game was really good! It was a <em>bit </em>thin in parts, but only in the way we've come to expect smaller games from smaller teams to be, so I never saw that as a problem. It was a great game, I had a great time with it, then I got on with my life. I never once thought "man, <em>Phantom Brigade</em> was good in parts, but it really needed some more work".</p><p>So it's been a pleasure reacquainting myself with the game over the last few weeks, as its surprising 2.0 release–<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553540/view/634572213702362190?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which came out in November 2025</u></a>--has banished any notion that this was in any way thin. The team at Brace Yourself Games have spent the last two years fleshing out every corner of this game, so while the time-based tactics stuff is still there and excellent, a lot of the campaign content, from pilots (who now have classes and traits) to improved menus to a much weightier overworld and mission roster, is now vastly improved.</p><p>Some of these tweaks and additions have come from the team, but others have come from implementing player feedback, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/553540/discussions/0/684112192552884369/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>like</u></a>:</p><blockquote>&nbsp;New salvage and debriefing menus, new mission previews and reward generation, reworked workshop and crafting, improved damage logic and prediction, new options and difficulty settings, comprehensive weapon balancing, subsystem reworks and much more!</blockquote><p>If you never heeded anyone's advice to try this game out, and you are in any way into mechs, tactics games and/or the passage of time, you may as well now that it's even better. But even if, like me, you <em>had </em>played the game and liked it, it's a rare pleasure to get to experience a proper 2.0, <em>No Man's Sky</em>-like release like this, so <em>Phantom Brigade's</em> second time around (which is a free update for existing owners) is absolutely worth revisiting.</p><p>(I don't wanna get Steam salesman-y here, but it's also available as part of a bundle with <em>Invisible Inc</em>,<a href="https://kotaku.com/invisible-inc-the-kotaku-review-1703519658?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>one of the greatest video games of all time</u></a>.)</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qd-0TuUuFaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Phantom Brigade 2.0 Free Major Update Trailer"></iframe></figure>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/whiskerwood-city-builder-mice-cats-timberton-factorio-indie-steam-early-access-2000662691</link>
            <guid>1414795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was around 1:45 in the morning, as I was laying down wooden walkways to help little rodents get to work faster, that I realized I was fully hooked by <em>Whiskerwood</em>, a newly released city-builder and resource manager that blends together <em>Timberborn</em>, <em>Factorio</em>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sid-meiers-colonization-is-the-best-4th-of-july-video-g-1600113277">Sid Meier’s Colonization</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Out now on Steam via early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/"><em>Whiskerwood</em> is a top-down real-time city builder</a> that has you leading Whiskers, lowly mouse peasants and workers, as they travel to new lands in the 1700s by order of the rich, powerful Claws, a group of royal cats. After picking a spot to build a dock for incoming ships and a warehouse to store goods, you start harvesting supplies to begin building up a tiny mouse settlement. Your goal isn’t simply to survive, but also to harvest enough resources, including fish, berries, logs, and rock, to pay off your taxes, which are claimed every so often in-game by a royal fleet. As you do, the amount of taxes you have to pay goes up, and wait a minute…I don’t think these Claws are good people!</p>

  <p>Early on, one of your mice rightfully points out that, hey, the Claws provided the mice supplies to build structures that would enrich the cats, but failed to provide much more than that, leaving the Whiskers basically on their own to figure out how to build a town and not all perish in a few days. Once again, not sure these cats can be trusted.</p> <p>This part of <em>Whiskerwood</em> is currently the least developed, with what sounds like plans to allow a self-sufficient colony to cut itself off from the Claws and even revolt. For now, that stuff mostly sits in the background and provides a good reason to harvest more and more supplies.</p>

 <p>While the game’s recreation of 1700s colonization hooked me at first, what kept me around until way too late the first night I played was the easy-to-understand city-building mechanics and smartly designed UI. Doing anything in <em>Whiskerwood</em> rarely takes more than two clicks. Each menu is easy to read, navigate, and close, which isn’t always the case in games like this. <em>Whiskerwood</em> also does a fantastic job, even in early access, of providing players with all the information they need to know about where mice are going, what they need, what’s missing, which resources are low, and so forth.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Minakata Dynamics</figcaption></figure> <p>I especially love the alert banners that appear for important problems, like an injured mouse. Or to let you know that a mouse might have a long trek to the mines from his tiny hovel. You just click on it, and it zips you to the problem, and from there, you’re usually a click away from moving a mouse or tweaking some part of a building.</p> <p>Making that trip shorter or more efficient is a breeze with <em>Whiskerwood’s</em> snappy building and management menus, which feel like they were built by people who understand how vital this stuff is to making a city builder fun. But all of this smart design doesn’t come at the cost of simplification! This is still a complex game that will demand that you create more and more elaborate networks of buildings, conveyors, stairs, transportation, housing, and storage to be able to not only pay your taxes but also survive harsher seasons and weather.</p>

 <p>I’ve only put about five hours into <em>Whiskerwood</em> so far, but based on what I’ve played and the gushing I’ve seen <a href="https://aftermath.site/whiskerwood-review-impressions-pc-city-builder-hooded-horse/">from city builder experts like Luke Plunkett over at <em>Aftermath</em>,</a> I’m excited to keep playing. Hopefully one day my tiny mice will rise up, seize the means of production from the Claws, and gain independence. For now, they’ll need to keep breaking rocks and cutting down trees for those fat cats.</p>

<p>A new job listing shows that Electronic Arts is laying the foundation for the next game in the Mass Effect series.</p>



<p>It has been the better part of a decade since the last release in the Mass Effect series, 2017’s Mass Effect: Andromeda. Now, EA has made a public move to secure the franchise’s direction. A new <a href="https://jobs.ea.com/en_US/careers/JobDetail/Production-Director/212271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> from EA notes that the company is seeking a production director to serve as a leader on the next title in the game series.</p>



<p>EA is hoping the new Mass Effect Production Director has 10+ years of experience on AAA titles, deep ARPG and RPG knowledge, and proven team-building.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a Production Director with a passion for the Mass Effect universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next Mass Effect title. You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-the-current-direction-of-the-mass-effect-ip">The Current Direction of the Mass Effect IP</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In November 2025, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble proclaimed that EA and BioWare remain<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-confirms-next-mass-effect-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> committed exclusively to the series</a> and noted that there are more stories to tell in the universe. It has also been suggested that many believe the next title in the series will be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-moves-some-employees-to-other-ea-projects-while-developing-mass-effect-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make-or-break moment for BioWare</a> after the turbulent development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>







<p>There’s also a TV series in the works at Amazon. However, it has been confirmed that the series will not adapt the original game trilogy and will be an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-trilogy-original-story/">original story set after the events of the third game.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grim dark world of <em>Warhammer 40k</em> it appears that the masters at Games Workshop have sent out their legal arbiters again. This time the arbiters (or as others may call them, lawyers,) have fired off a <em>Void War </em>DMCA, taking down the video game from Steam.&nbsp;</p><p>Released last June, <em>Void War</em> is an <em>FTL</em>-like roguelite game that heavily homages the Games Workshop created <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bc2812a-69f3-4947-89d3-4c79996f4d0f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>. In fact, when I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">wrote about it as part of Steam Next Fest</a> in February 2025 I said that it seemed to have "scrubbed off" references, as in changing names and other elements sometimes called 'filing off the serial numbers'.</p><p>While not a huge success, <em>Void War</em> had done pretty well for itself on Steam, until last night when the game was mysteriously removed from the PC store front. At first there was no comment from the developer, and then a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243800199705595/" rel="nofollow">general post</a> made that they were working with Steam to rectify the situation. Speculation abounded, but this afternoon, they provided a more in-depth response confirming that it was indeed a DMCA takedown.</p><picture>

Their attempts to contact Games Workshop to confirm have so far failed to be replied to. In the meantime, Tundra Interactive is going through the DMCA process and says they will, "share further updates when we have confirmed information."&nbsp;</p><p>We also reached out to Games Workshop to inquire, but they did not immediately respond to our inquiry. In the interim, <em>Void War</em> isn't available on Steam though you can still see their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/" rel="nofollow">forums</a> there. If you want to pick up <em>Void War</em>, it's in early access and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">available on Itch.io</a> for the moment. That version will also provide you with a Steam key if/when this current situation is resolved.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-forza-horizon-6-ps5-delay-launch-fable-reboot-2000662665</link>
            <guid>1414765</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Xbox gave us an idea of when to expect its two biggest games of 2026: <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-everything-we-know-xbox-biggest-map-online-play-ps5-release-date-2000662346"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> will land on May 15, and the long-awaited <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-seamless-open-world-and-is-launching-this-fall-2000662295"><em>Fable</em> reboot</a> will arrive sometime in the fall. But oddly, while <em>Fable</em> is launching on the same (as-yet unknown) day on Xbox and PS5, <em>Horizon 6</em> isn’t. Instead, its PS5 version will arrive sometime after the Xbox release. When pressed on why this was the case, one Xbox exec provided a confusing answer.</p> <p><a href="https://keleops-usa.slack.com/archives/C099JF8RR7T/p1769193061207769">In a new interview with <em>GamesRadar</em></a>, Xbox Game Studios head Craig Duncan told the outlet that he and Xbox have a “pretty simple view” about bringing their games and franchises, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War,</em></a> to more platforms. “We want our games to reach the most players that we can,” explained Duncan. “It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?”</p>

 <p>Okay, sure, we’ve heard this before from Xbox. They want to be on more platforms and give people more ways to play. Fine. But when asked specifically why <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597"><em>Fable</em></a> is launching at the same time on Xbox and PS5, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-game-pass-early-access-price-increase-premium-edition-60-120-2000662606"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> isn’t, Duncan admitted that “sometimes we are inconsistent.”</p> <p>“You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places,” Duncan told the outlet. “Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.”</p>

 <p>According to him, Xbox won’t commit to every future game launching day one on PS5 because the company wants to “maintain optionality.”</p> <p>“If we’re only in a position to release a game on a platform and not have it show up really well? Then I think we wouldn’t do that. I think we would have a conversation internally and go, ‘Hey, unless we can do it really well and do the right thing by those players, then…’ and that’s when you get into conversations of, well, maybe we can ship it afterwards. Because teams are only a set size. We only have a certain amount of…ultimately, it all comes down to resources. Not everything is limitless. So we just want to do the best job, by each platform, by each game.”</p>

 <p>According to Duncan, sometimes games need extra time to get them running on a different platform. And that does sound plausible. But it is very convenient that <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, a super hyped-up sequel to one of Xbox’s biggest hits, isn’t coming to PS5 right away. Meanwhile, <em>Fable</em>, a long-delayed reboot of a franchise that has been MIA for over a decade, is launching on PS5 as well as Xbox. You could theorize that Xbox wants to keep <em>Forza</em> on its platforms, like Xbox Cloud and Game Pass, as exclusives for an extended period of time, and push people to play there. Regardless, it’s clear that the future of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805">Xbox’s multiplatform strategy</a> is kind of all over the place and will likely continue to be that way for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/remedy-defends-epic-games-deal-alan-wake-2/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Remedy's Alan Wake 2</strong> had a great reception when it launched in late October 2023. It received excellent review scores (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a 9 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), many awards (three at TGA 2023: Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, and Best Art Direction), and even became the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-is-remedys-fastest-selling-title-at-1-3-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>fastest-selling game released by the Finnish studio to date</strong></a>, with <strong>over 1.3 million units</strong> sold as of February 2024. However, sales slowed down quickly afterward. As of late November 2024, Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to admit to its investors</a> that the development and marketing costs hadn't yet been fully recovered. That only changed in February 2025, when the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally broke the 2 </a></strong><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-2-million-units-remedy-has-a-new-unannounced-project-in-the-works/" target="_blank"><strong>million-unit mark</strong></a>&nbsp;and began</span> generating royalties for the studio.</p>



<p>Obviously, this relative underperformance for a title that most genre fans agree is very well-made was discussed thoroughly by fans and industry professionals alike. Two of the main factors identified were <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/">th</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2/"> lack of a physical release at launch</a> (which only changed a year later) and, most importantly, the fact that the PC version was and is still only available on the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> rather than <strong>Valve's Steam</strong>, by far the largest game distribution store on the platform. The permanent exclusivity of Alan Wake 2 didn't sit well with some gamers, who to this day refuse to install the Epic Games Launcher to buy and play the game. </p>



<p>The discussion on the subject was suddenly reignited this week by <strong>Larian's</strong> outspoken <strong>Director of Publishing</strong>, <strong>Michael Douse</strong>. It all started <span>with the comments of&nbsp;<strong>New Blood Interactive CEO Dave Oshry</strong>, who noted on social media that </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>giving away a game for free on the Epic Games Store also boosted sales of the same game</span> on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Addressing that claim, Epic Games founder and CEO <strong>Tim Sweeney</strong> <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717884711633121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> that 'gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals', adding with a jab to Gabe Newell and his famous acquisition of a massive yacht that <strong>the Epic Games Store is now '55-60%' of Steam's userbase</strong> and that, unlike Valve, the company is reinvesting some of its revenue into the Free Program to the benefit of both developers and users.</p>



<p>That's when Douse <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went ahead to say</a> that Remedy '<strong>seemingly went into financial crisis</strong>' because of the game's Epic Games Store exclusivity on PC, losing '<strong>potentially hundreds of millions</strong>' by not launching on Steam.</p>



<p><em>I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue.</em></p>



<p><em>Not that they need the money, but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic. Ultimately, the viability of the store sits on their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers, and I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that. The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences.</em></p>



<p>In a surprising twist, Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actually chose to answer Douse directly</a>, outlining that <strong>there would be no game at all without Epic's help</strong> and stressing that <strong>they received a 'very fair' publishing deal</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy. While these complex deals can often take even a year to reach their conclusion, and may not always be fair to the developer, this one was. And it only took months to get done. Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us. Steam or no Steam.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, while Alan Wake 2 would have sold more if it had launched on Steam, it is unlikely that it would have really garnered a large amount of extra sales. The first installment sold a similar amount, after all, and it didn't have that issue. Moreover, it isn't like it's the only Remedy game to suffer this fate. <strong>The studio is known for its portfolio of great games that never quite sold as well as they should have</strong>, with the exception of <strong>Control</strong>, which is, however, in a much more popular genre. If there's anything the studio regrets right now, it is more likely to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-ceo-steps-down-after-9-years-following-fbc-firebreak-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>the disastrous</strong> <strong>FBC: Firebreak</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It was already excellent news for gamers (and for Epic itself) that <strong>a sequel was made at all, which was far from guaranteed</strong>, and even more so that it turned out to be <strong>a fantastic survival horror game</strong>, thus keeping the Remedy Connected Universe going. On that note, a new entry will be released this year: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CONTROL Resonant</a></strong>, a full-fledged action RPG <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a></strong>, making it more likely to turn profitable in a short time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Pokémon Store Was Robbed At Gunpoint, But It’s Only Made Its Community Stronger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this month, Poké Court, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card and collectible shop in the Manhattan Meatpacking District, was holding a community event where fans gathered to decorate top loaders for their cards. The event was a first of its kind for the store, which opened in November. But that’s not why the people there that night will remember it. The event was crashed by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>a group of masked robbers who held the store up at gunpoint</span></a><span>, smashed glass cases and shelves,&nbsp; and stole over $100,000 worth of collector’s merchandise. “They just grabbed whatever they could,” said owner Courtney Chin.</span></p> <p><span>Stories like this have unfortunately become </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>more and more common</span></a><span> as the scalper market has become a quick money-making scheme for people who don’t even care about Pikachu, Charizard, or any of the other monsters in the series. Stores have reported everything from armed robberies and being assaulted with pepper spray to people tunneling into stores like they’re in a heist movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A store in Huntington Beach, California got hit right before the recent Christmas holiday. Thieves reportedly burrowed through some part of the shop’s roof. “It’s hard not to worry with so many other stores being hit,” the owner, Jerry Hernandez, </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>told the </span><i><span>Los Angeles Times</span></i></a><span>. “I feel like once we got hit and some of the other shops got hit it created a snowball effect.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662648">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When I went to Poké Court this week, located on a cobblestone side street close to the Hudson River, the shelves were mostly still empty, but they did have a bouquet of flowers sitting on them next to some of the Pokémon card top loaders fans had come together to decorate. If I hadn’t already known about the smash and grab, there would have been little to suggest Poké Court had been the target of a terrible crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It was the middle of a cold Manhattan January afternoon, and the store still had dozens of customers coming in and out to joyfully buy and open trading card packs at the shop’s bartop. But if you paid attention, there were clues to what had happened. Before I even spoke to anyone in the store, a customer was offering their condolences to the staff, who graciously accepted their kind words. In the corner of the entrance, Chin was putting the store’s new security system through its paces.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>“A world we must defend”</h2> <p><span>Chin started what would become a brick-and-mortar shop in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country out of her second bedroom after getting back into </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting in a “really intense way.” She wanted to create something more “specialized” than your average card shop. Trading cards have become such a lucrative hobby and business that most collectible stores diversify their stock, carrying sports cards alongside the </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> packs people love. Poké Court is meant to be a place where </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans can reliably show up and know the store is dedicated to the franchise they’re obsessed with, and is staffed by people with extensive experience and knowledge about its long and hype-fueled history.</span></p> <p><span>“These are my friends who also grew up having the same core memories and really loving the franchise and thinking about all the values of Pokémon that we really resonate with,” Chin tells me. “We love the idea of community. We love the idea of trust, and even the theme song’s ‘being the very best,’ right? It tries to bring out the best in people, and it teaches you about resilience and hardship. And I think there are a lot of core lessons that my generation really took to heart.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>sellers will go to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>larger community events and card shows</span></a><span>, Chin says that having the brick-and-mortar location makes it less feasible to uproot the shop to do temporary events. But that physical presence also helps anchor the business and foster a local community, one that has weathered the changing, difficult storms of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>post-Covid, scalper-addled chaos</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“When I first started, I used to price things at MSRP or even below,” Chin says. “I would want to have the best prices so people would always come to my shop and buy from me. Once it became all about money, we would have some individuals—I don’t want to assign a label to them—but they would come and just buy everything and then immediately sell it. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a free market. But then they got really creative and they started botting our site. So we would drop something on our site and then we would immediately get flooded with hundreds of orders from the same individuals buying out all of our products. Then we would get an angry response from our actual customers and our regulars and they’re like, ‘You didn’t save anything.’”</span></p> <p><span>In response, Poké Court has had to adjust prices, which Chin acknowledges raises the barrier to entry for some people. But the lengths to which people would go to buy out all of the shop’s stock for cheap and then flip it became “unsavory,” even escalating into shouting matches and fights outside the store.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It really shouldn’t be about the money but unfortunately that’s what everyone focuses on because it’s so attention grabbing,” Chin says. “Then people get excited, they’re like, ‘oh, my collection is now worth $1,000 instead of $100. I’ve made so much money.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp.

Chin was in the store’s back room when Poké Court’s top loader event was wrapping up. Around 40 customers and 14 employees were in the store at the time, including folks who just wanted to hang out for the festivities. Chin knew something was wrong the second she heard the sound of glass shattering. Employees and customers rushed to the back of the store for safety as the robbers went to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662647">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Chin was able to hit the store’s panic button and call the police. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but thousands of dollars worth of vintage and rare merchandise from across the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise’s 30 years was gone. That’s where most reports about what happened at Poké Court end, but that’s not the whole story.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>“Our courage will pull us through”</h2> <p><span>“I thought that our shop would be deserted and everyone would be scared and employees would resign because they feel like this is an unsafe work environment, but it was almost the opposite,” Chin says. “Everyone really bonded together and wanted to stay here longer. After the robbery, everyone could have gone home, which is the rational thing to do, but everyone, we had 50 people here, and they all wanted to stay. They all stood in line and gave their statements to the police, and they all wanted to be here for each other.”</span></p> <p><span>The New York Poké Court community showed up for each other, but as word of the shop’s story spread, Chin says the broader Pokémon community has reached out in support as well. Big content creators have shared the store’s </span><a href="https://thepokecourt.com/products/poke-court-community-support?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnU0K6HAZne1CZRccxo-cJqqgib4qA0IczzxBbERK_Ihk0YJf_IDG8l87qarA_aem_wDNuUu1z2EFKMndQncv8NA"><span>community fund</span></a><span> that’s raised thousands of dollars. Even big names in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> started reaching out </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DThGXC4jJ5P/?hl=en"><span>on social media</span></a><span>. Chin says the store has gotten an influx of job applications, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“They’re like, ‘I want to work for you’ and I’m like, ‘We just got held up. I can’t believe you would want to spend more time in this spot.’ So I think that it’s very encouraging that people are bouncing back even harder than ever. We’re not going to let a robbery stop us.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662649">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The support has gone beyond just people donating money. Some have offered musical performances in-store while others bring in food for staff. The immediate pillow of support has been a “big morale booster” for the team. While the Poké Court has been in headlines over one of the worst things that could have happened to it, Chin wants people to know that the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community is more than just collectors chasing the most valuable cards.</span></p> <p><span>“One of the most common misconceptions is that the Pokémon community is full of people who only are in it for the money or only care about investing or are scalpers,” she says. “You just hear the worst, right? But for better or for worse, this robbery has shown how people can come together in a really positive and genuinely heartwarming way to support total strangers, to support their local card shop, to support all the people who were absolutely traumatized by this experience. I’ve just been floored and humbled and I’m so thankful that there’s this massive community.”</span></p> <p><span>As the shop’s story has spread on social media, neighboring card shops around the state have also been reaching out about the stolen merchandise, verifying certification numbers in case the robbers try to sell what they took. The entire thing has made Chin feel like the shop has a “network of friends” that expands far beyond New York City.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I left Poké Court this week, it was just as full of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans as it’s ever been, though it now has additional security. There was a version of the store’s future where fans stopped showing up to buy and open packs, scared off by the threat of violence over a hobby that’s supposed to be about bringing people together. Instead, the store is bouncing back, thanks in no small part to a community that was never in it for the money to begin with. They were in it for each other and the friends they’ve met along the way through a shared love of Pokémon.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/world-warcraft-midnight-wow-transmog-changes-update-2000662662</link>
            <guid>1414669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Days after hiking up the prices to transmogrify your armor in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/world-of-warcraft"><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i></a><span>, developer Blizzard announced it’s reducing them in half—a decision that came after overwhelming player outrage.</span></p> <p><span>The transmog fiasco started with the launch of the pre-expansion patch for </span><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> on January 20. The patch introduced a plethora of updates to a number of the game’s systems, and the transmog system, which allows players to change the appearance of armor pieces for previously acquired gear without affecting their stats, was one of them. The transmog overhaul ushered in two big problems for the community: the new system is convoluted, and to make matters worse, it’s incredibly expensive. Or used to be, anyway, as Blizzard has already announced it’s dialing the inflation rate back.</span></p> <p><span>“We’re going to lower the cost of outfit creation prices by 50% to bring them more in line with what the prices were prior to the Transmog update,” community manager Linxy </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128/696"><span>wrote on the Blizzard forums</span></a><span> yesterday. “This price reduction is currently under development and should be available within the next day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The change makes sense, as the new system has characters starting with just two outfit slots for their transmog creations. You can unlock more, of course, but initial prices started at 100 gold and ramped up to almost 800,000 gold to unlock all 20 slots on a given character. So, if you’re somebody who juggles five characters at once and you like to engage with the in-game fashion, having 20 slots for all five of them would cost almost 4 million gold. And this is all without considering the costs of changing the individual pieces in said outfits.</span></p> <p><span>Now, all of these prices are being halved. In addition, Linxy said the team is “going to try” to grant one free transmog to all player-characters soon, before patch 12.0.1. This should “hopefully” happen via a hotfix.</span></p>

 <p><span>The free transmog is also part of the response to community complaints. When Blizzard released the pre-expansion patch, all transmogs that were previously applied to gear were removed. As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128"><span>explained</span></a><span> by community manager Kaivax on the forums, this was intentional to reflect the transition from a gear-based to a slot-based system. All previously saved loadouts are still present, converted to Custom Sets as part of the new system. The problem, however, is that it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first transmog to your character, even if you only want to set your appearance back to the way it was before. Kaivax called this “an oversight” on the developers’ part, as players should be able to maintain or reset their existing look without cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>“With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of </span><i><span>Midnight</span></i><span>, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog,” continues the response. “This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs.”</span></p> <h2><b>Pricing isn’t the only problem with the new transmog system</b></h2> <p><span>While the pricing reduction is a welcoming change, it hardly addresses the only qualm that </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> players have with the new transmog system. The community is also complaining about the convoluted UX, as it used to be simpler in the old system, as well as the multiple added steps the latest changes require.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think I’ve spent about half of my gametime playing dress up since transmog has been released as a feature,” reads a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1qj7opk/not_to_be_dramatic_but_im_quitting_over_the_new/"><span>Reddit thread</span></a><span> from a </span><i><span>World of Warcraft </span></i><span>player who says they’re quitting the game. “Now (…) trying to set up anything just fills me with apathy. Why was the icon selection and naming of sets downgraded for the ‘main’ transmog screen? The outdated all-in-one icon selection from classic, without search or prioritizing your outfit’s items is MASSIVELY more annoying than the previous transmog system’s auto-select that just went with the first item’s icon of your outfit. Also, 16 characters limit for outfit names is nonsense.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662666"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662666">©Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This account is far from the only one voicing such complaints. In the replies to an </span><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/transmogrification/everything-about-transmog-ui-appearances"><span>explainer</span></a><span> by </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> enthusiast site </span><i><span>Wowhead</span></i><span>, people have posted multiple questions about the minutiae of the system. “I just opened up WoW and ALL my warriors look ridiculous,” reads one of the comments. “All the gear I’ve put on them over the years is gone and they look like noobs. I have lost over 2K gold trying to figure out the new transmog bs and when I check them out, they’re still in the wrong stuff. I’ve saved, I’ve bought a slot. I’ve only played WoW since it’s inception so yes, I’m older than most but this is ridiculous and it’s enough to make me want to quit the game.”</span></p> <p><span>Those on roleplaying servers are particularly impacted by these issues, as for many of them, transmogrification is particularly important to defining character identity, as well as adding to the immersion of certain events and actions. Say, for example, that your character is wearing a hood or a helmet, and you want to switch out to a scarf when entering a house. In the old system, you could open your inventory bags and select another transmogged item, switching it on the fly. Now, that individual item transmogging is no longer possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-loss-of-an-important-feature-for-roleplayers/2202216"><span>explained by a veteran roleplayer</span></a><span> in the forums, people in these servers are prone to keep flavor items in their possession, such as cloaks to change depending on the weather environment, or a set of white gloves when a character needs to provide medical care for someone.</span></p> <p><span>The use cases are many, but unfortunately, the latest changes to transmogrification have introduced limitations. Instead of selecting an item from your inventory, you would have to pay gold to make a change to your current outfit, only to pay again once you revert it later. Plus, these actions take time, which can interrupt the flow of immersion during active scenes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I am not a coder, I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement a system where certain items are exempt from the outfit that your character is currently wearing, but I implore you Blizzard, please find a way to allow us to make changes to individual outfit slots on the fly without having to engage with the transmog interface and shell out gold every time,” concludes the post from the roleplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> is releasing on March 2. Whether Blizzard decides to roll out more changes based on community feedback remains to be seen.</span></p>

<p>The next Resident Evil remake is coming within the next 18 months. </p>



<p>In a post on social media, NateTheHate reaffirmed that not only is Resident Evil Code: Veronica being remade, but that it’s “deep in development”. He then went on the mention when Capcom is targeting a release.</p>







<p>“Target of release is first half 2027,” <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve heard claims of Code: Veronica being remade. In fact, rumblings about the game have been going on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since at least 2024</a>. Rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-remakes-scheduled-for-2027-2028-respectively-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that the remake</a> of the 26-year-old game will be announced sometime this year ahead of the aforementioned 2027 launch.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica first launched in February 2000, exclusively for the Sega Dreamcast. After that console went under, the game was re-released as Resident Evil Code: Veronica X for the PlayStation 2 (2001) and Nintendo GameCube (2003). It even came to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/46-congress-members-express-serious-concerns-over-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout-ftc/</link>
            <guid>1414654</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> announced that it planned to become a privately owned company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">with the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong> leading a '<strong>Consortium</strong>' of investors in a massive <strong>$55 billion</strong> buyout</a>. The buyout has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">passed the approval of the company's shareholders</a>, with the next and final step being getting the approval of global regulators, including the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). As that process is ongoing, we don't know yet whether the FTC will choose to fight the acquisition or let it pass, but as many as <strong>46 members of the US Congress</strong> don't want the deal to go through without the FTC "<em>thoroughly</em>" looking it over.</p>



<p><a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/laborcaucus.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/letter-to-ftc-on-proposed-acquisition-of-electronic-arts-ea.pdf">In an open letter</a> to the FTC chair, <strong>Andrew Ferguson</strong>, signed by 46 House Democrats led by the Labor Caucus co-chairs, <strong>Steven Horsford</strong>, <strong>Debbie Dingell</strong>, <strong>Mark Pocan</strong>, and <strong>Donald Norcross</strong>, the representatives express their "<em>serious concerns</em>" with the deal, and want it to be "<em>thoroughly reviewed</em>" as it comes under the FTC's purview. </p>



<p>"<em>We are writing to express serious concerns regarding the proposed acquisition of Electronic Arts (EA) by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, and private equity firms<br>Silver Lake and Affinity Partners,</em>" the letter begins. "<em>We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction</em>."</p>



<p>The letter goes on to cite the recent instability of the video game industry, which has suffered tens of thousands of job losses in recent years, EA's contributions to those layoffs, and the massive disconnect between EA's executive leadership and its median worker, highlighted by EA's chief executive officer, <strong>Andrew Wilson</strong>, taking home<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year"> <strong>260 times more</strong> compared to the median EA worker.</a></p>



<p>It noted concerns over the fact that the buyout comes with <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">EA taking on <strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which it says "<em>creates strong incentives for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including <strong>layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closures</strong></em>." The letter also expresses competition-based concerns, saying that the scale of the "<em>cross-ownership</em>" involved, were the deal to go through, "<em>presents risks of self-preferencing and anticompetitive coordination across these sports, sports-related talent, and sports related video game business lines. This could, consequently, restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry.</em>"</p>



<p>The last major point the letter makes is one indicating that this merger, should it be approved, could violate some of the FTC's own antitrust laws regarding mergers that harm workers, suppress wages, and enable dominant firms to reduce labor demands. It then closes by saying, </p>



<p>"<em>We respectfully urge the Commission to conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes. Workers deserve a fair, competitive marketplace where their skills are valued</em>."</p>



<p>These 46 House Democrats are not the first to share these kinds of concerns over the buyout. The $20 billion in debt is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">something several other industry figures have already pointed to as a problem</a>, and that's even before getting into the creative concerns, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">even as EA claims it will "<em>maintain creative control</em>" after the buyout</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/maxis-promises-the-sims-values-remain-unchanged-amidst-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout/"><strong>The Sims</strong> developer <strong>Maxis</strong> made a similar claim earlier this month,</a> saying its values will remain "<em>unchanged</em>" after the acquisition, a claim that players are struggling to believe. There's already precedent for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly impacting creative decisions in <strong>Fatal Fury</strong></a>, which itself is realistically a small matter in the grand scheme of things, since it can be boiled down to the Saudi Arabia PIF allegedly using its influence to put a sports icon it has financial ties to in this new video game it owns. Not the worst thing in the world.</p>



<p>But if the group were to have used its influence for a small, ultimately trivial matter like that, it's understandable that The Sims players would have concerns that core elements to the long-running life sim, like being able to act out whatever lifestyle you want, including ones that are considered criminal offences in Saudi Arabia, would change.</p>



<p>And while we've not yet seen reports of Maxis employees voicing their concerns, anonymously or not, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-devs-reportedly-worried-55-billion-ea-buyout/">employees at EA's <strong>BioWare</strong> have already done so</a>. There's simply no getting around the fact that this deal has a lot of people, inside and outside of EA, seriously concerned.</p>



<p>Of course, these concerns could be all for naught, and the deal could go through, and all of the bad things people fear will happen won't actually happen. We won't know until the deal officially closes, and we won't see that happen until the FTC and other global regulators weigh in on the deal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Queen’s Blood fans, it's time to celebrate. The addictive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a> card game is making a “powered-up” comeback for the final chapter in Square Enix’s remake trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Polygon</u></a> spoke with director Naoki Hamaguchi about the progress of development on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</u></a> and touched on the topic of one of the more popular virtual pastimes of 2024. He says he plans to double down on the card game when its next installment finally launches, promising to “expand” what was seen with its Rebirth launch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi said. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so that we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The director declines to share exactly what a spruced-up version of Queen’s Blood will look like, but it’s easy to imagine an expansion of new cards and new side-quests shaking up the gameplay. However, Hamaguchi’s comments suggest players may be in for a somewhat substantial upgrade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hamaguchi adds that the original Final Fantasy 7 mini-game featuring snowboarding is also coming back for Remake Part 3. He teases that “it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame,” adding that it will be incorporated into the story and its themes, but stops short of providing more details.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy is jam-packed with a variety of mini-games to keep Cloud and company’s fight against Sephiroth from getting too serious, but most fans are just looking forward to seeing how the retelling will finally finish its story. Hamaguchi and the rest of the Square Enix team is far from ready to share a release date, but he says development is at least “coming along very smoothly.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set,” Hamaguchi adds. “So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a round of positive updates for Final Fantasy Remake Part 3, which arrives just shy of the two-year anniversary of the launch of Rebirth.
