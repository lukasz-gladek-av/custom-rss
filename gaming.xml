Activision Blizzard has dropped the Season 14 launch trailer, and it ended with a glimpse of Overwatch 2's next collaboration: Avatar: The Last Airbender.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of Avatar: The Last Airbender is coming to Overwatch 2! ‚¨áÔ∏è‚ú®<br>Join the fun when our latest collaboration arrives in-game on Dec 17 ü§© <a href="https://t.co/Z0HvK17NXv" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Z0HvK17NXv</a></p>  ‚Äî Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1864720158322794691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The image is meant to invoke Avatar Aang, the main character of The Last Airbender. But if this is anything like Overwatch 2's previous collaborations, it will simply be an Aang-inspired costume for one of the game's characters. That's going to arrive on December 17.</p><p>In the meantime, Season 14 is set to premiere on December 10. As seen in the launch trailer below, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-hero-hazard-revealed-playable-this-week/1100-6527866/" data-ref-id="1100-6527866">the new character is named Hazard</a>, and he's a tank hero who is very fast for his size.

Additionally, Season 14 features the return of Winter Wonderland, including Mei's Snowball Offensive and Freezethaw Elimination. But this part of Season 14 will only last until January 6.</p><p>Season 14 will also temporarily bring back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">6v6 player matches</a> as a test.

With that much time passing, we can expect fully formed characters that have been through a lot.</p><p>‚ÄúIt picks up five years later. And so in theory, these are characters who have all lived five years of life and all of the twists and turns that you take in the meantime.‚Äù</p><p><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> leading man Charlie Cox first spoke about these changes during an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/daredevil-born-again-is-a-continuation-of-the-netflix-show-a-lot-of-the-history-follows-on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/tv/news/daredevil-born-again-is-a-continuation-of-the-netflix-show-a-lot-of-the-history-follows-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Empire</em> interview</a></span>, staring that in the new show‚Äôs timeline, ‚ÄúMatt‚Äôs made peace with his role both as a lawyer and a vigilante.‚Äù While this may be a new development for the <em>Daredevil</em> series itself, it won‚Äôt fully be one in Marvel canon. Cox appeared on Marvel‚Äôs <em>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, </em>which takes place in 2023, and also appeared in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> which takes place in late 2024. That would situate the upcoming <em>Daredevil</em> series as a predecessor to those two appearances. </p><p>In those two appearances, we get a sense of this newfound balance of identities. In <em>She-Hulk, </em>we see Cox as lawyer Matt Murdock advising fellow lawyer Jennifer Walters (Tatiana Maslany) to embrace her superhero powers as She-Hulk to exert justice when the law doesn‚Äôt work, showing he‚Äôs come to terms with the duality of his role in the world. He also showed this balance after having sex with her and exhibiting what may be Marvel‚Äôs first superhero walk of shame in full costume. </p><p>The same is true for his appearance in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> when he gave legal advice to Peter Parker and reflexively snatched a brick thrown through Parker‚Äôs window. When Parker, who normally has the quickest reflexes in any room he‚Äôs in, asks how he did that, Murdock again highlighted that balance between lawyer and vigilante by saying his superhuman feat is the product of being a really good lawyer. </p><p>That‚Äôs all well and good, but <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is going to have to show us how it fits within all of the events that have happened in the five years since the Netflix series. We still don‚Äôt know who from the <em>Daredevil</em> universe was affected by Thanos‚Äôs Infinity Gauntlet snap. The series also takes place before the events of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-movie-russo-arcane-avengers-endgame-1851691386?_gl=1*mufm68*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MjMxMDkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-movie-russo-arcane-avengers-endgame-1851691386?_gl=1*mufm68*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDYwMC45MC4xLjE3MzM0MjMxMDkuNjAuMC4w"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a></span>, when everyone who‚Äôd previously been evaporated was brought back. Since the series takes place before Thanos‚Äô genocidal acts were reversed, we at least now know Daredevil survived the blip. </p><p>With <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>situated between two of the biggest moments in MCU history, there‚Äôs potential for plenty of cool easter eggs throughout the series that refer back to that history. Those moments should help give us a sense of time, even if that time is Marvel‚Äôs confusing version of it. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-unveils-hexe-marie-boss-fight-in-crimson-desert/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pearl Abyss has unveiled a brand-new gameplay video from their upcoming open-world action-adventure game, Crimson Desert. This game is not to be confused with the MMORPG Black Desert Online. The video showcases the intense boss fight players will have against Hexe Marie. If you want to see what you'll be up against when fighting Hexe Marie, you can check it out in the combat video below, which is just under seven and a half minutes, showing you all of the frightening moves you'll have to contend with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert ‚Äì Hexe Marie Boss Battle Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrQgbLuIzq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many boss fight videos have been posted on the official Crimson Desert YouTube channel, including videos of <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/">some early gameplay</a> that showcases the environments and exploration that players can expect to experience for themselves.</p>
<p>The battle with Hexe Marie is a little bit different from the other boss fights that have been showcased by Pearl Abyss, as Hexe Marie is a two-phase fight. Not only do players have to fight off against Hexe Marie, but they also have to kill the waves of her summoned minions, which leads to an incredibly intense fight.</p>
<p>Kliff can use ice arrows and explosive arrows to take out the hordes of minions that she summons. While this is just one option, there are many different ways for the player to experiment in battle to create their own strategies to overcome the target.</p>
<p>For those who are just hearing about this game for the first time, Crimson Desert takes place in the huge continent of Pywel and tells the tale of Kliff and his comrades as they go on an extensive journey to fulfill their mission while finding secrets and uncovering new mysteries about their lived-in home world. While the game doesn't have a release date yet, it's set to release simultaneously on PC and consoles when the time comes.</p>
<p>In addition to the fight and the gameplay elements that are being shown in this video, Pearl Abyss has also drawn attention to some of the changes they've made since the first public hands-on demo of the game at Gamescom 2024. This includes updates to the user interface and the target lock system in particular, both of which are essential tools to the player.</p>
<p>For more on Crimson Desert, you can check out <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main/Index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their official website</a>, which includes information about boss fights they've shared previously, as well as the option to sign up to their newsletter for emails when there are new updates.</p>

Then, months after the viral video had faded from most people‚Äôs memories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hawk-tuah-girl-jake-paul-podcast-betr-haliey-welch-1851639848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hawk-tuah-girl-jake-paul-podcast-betr-haliey-welch-1851639848">Welch announced she was doing a podcast</a></span> on Jake Paul‚Äôs sports betting network.

The memecoin launched on December 4 and quickly reached a total market value of $490 million. Just a few hours later, the value of the coin had crashed as people started selling en masse. As of this writing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/exygvxvrvujjryo65vyuhlaccxhwyztkqa7jxqit2tvr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawkcoin‚Äôs market value is hovering around $28 million, a nearly  95 percent drop</a></span>. Yikes.</p><p>A drop that fast has some people speculating that Welch and her team could have purposely inflated the coin, pumping up its value, then dumping it at its peak and making a lot of money in the process. Welch has denied this, saying that she and her team didn‚Äôt inflate the coin‚Äôs value and blamed the crash on snipers.

                <p>The recently concluded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a> animated series on Netflix is one of the best advertisements for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/league-of-legends-review/1900-6415183/" data-ref-id="1900-6415183">League of Legends</a> that Riot Games could have hoped for. But some fans are already voicing their displeasure over aspects from Arcane spilling into the game, particularly with the new look for Viktor.</p><p>The new models debuted on the test servers in November, with implementation in the main game expected to occur next week. Prior to the changes, Viktor's in-game portrayal depicted him as a larger and more imposing figure than the new Viktor character model. The updated version of Viktor is inspired by his portrayal in the show, and he now has a much thinner body shape. Riot Games has already modified the latest designs for Viktor in response to the negative feedback, but that hasn't been enough to settle the issue yet. The following video illustrates some of the differences between the new Viktor skins and the old ones.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHTIrkYHn3Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHTIrkYHn3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After their initial makeovers, the Deathsworn Viktor and Creator Viktor skins were modified to more closely reflect Viktor's previous in-game appearance without fully walking back the changes made to his model. So far, the hardcore Viktor fans--especially the ones who paid for the original skins--don't appear to be satisfied by those adjustments. Subsequently, Riot's Paul Bellezza stated on X/Twitter that the developer is "looking at making some adjustments to Viktor's update based on your feedback."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RiotPabro/status/1864369476852175008" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quick update on Arcane Fractured Jinx and Viktor‚Äôs update:<br>We‚Äôre adding Jinx‚Äôs iconic finale hood to her first form (Hero of Zaun) in Patch 14.24.

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 is a dream for many PlayStation owners. It‚Äôs been too long since Indy graced our screens in computer game form, and it feels like the right moment. Thankfully, we don‚Äôt need to go on a crusade to tell you the status of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle‚Äôs release schedule.</p>



<p>The iconic Indiana Jones jingle applies to almost any situation. Carry the shopping into your house in one go, play the jingle, beat a boss on a game, play the jingle, watch footage of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-full-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>‚Äîyou get the idea. It‚Äôs fair to say Indiana Jones games haven‚Äôt gone down as well as the films, with releases such as The Emperor‚Äôs Tomb and Staff of Kings not living long in the memory.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs time for Indy to have a successful virtual outing‚Äîthat isn‚Äôt a LEGO entry‚Äîand Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 can be the one. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-coming-to-playstation-5">Is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Coming to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Take that doubters! Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is definitely coming to PlayStation 5</strong>, despite initial doubts it would due to Microsoft‚Äôs ownership of Bethesda Softworks.</p>



<p>In September 2020, Microsoft famously purchased Bethesda in a shocking deal worth $7.5 billion. Microsoft effectively owned the rights to a ton of franchises in the blink of an eye: Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, DOOM, and Wolfenstein. Bethesda announced it was working on a new Indiana Jones game several months after the announcement‚Äîleaving PlayStation players in the dark over its release exclusivity.</p>



<p>An agreement was eventually released ensuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is confirmed for PS5</a>. The slight caveat is the Xbox Series X|S and PC get first dibs for a few months, meaning, PS users need to channel some patience. So it‚Äôs not all Temple of Doom and gloom, and even the developer is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-developers-thrilled-game-is-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thrilled the Great Circle is making its way to PS5</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-releasing-on-ps5">When is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Releasing on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>April 2025 is when Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is expected to release on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>The projected Great Circle launch window for PS5 comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge‚Äôs Tom Warren</a>, In a report, they said, ‚ÄúSources familiar with Bethesda‚Äôs plans tell me the company has been targeting an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2025 release for&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;on PS5</a>, but this date could naturally shift depending on development schedules.‚Äù</p>



<p>Obviously, this wording means there could be some changes as we get closer to April 2025. Take the information with a grain of salt‚Äîalthough Tom is a very reliable reporter‚Äîin case Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn‚Äôt release in April 2025.</p>



<hr>



<p>As a PS5 owner, I‚Äôm more than happy to see Indiana Jones and the Great Circle eventually come to the console. Do you think this is better for everyone involved? Let us know in the comments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Longtime Valve watchers likely remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/steam-machines/">Steam Machines</a>, the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">aborted</a>, pre-Steam Deck attempt at crafting a line of third-party gaming PC hardware based around <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/valve-first-version-of-steamos-to-be-released-to-the-masses-on-friday/">an early verison of its Linux-based SteamOS</a>. Now, there are strong signs that Valve is on the verge of launching a similar third-party hardware branding effort under the "Powered by SteamOS" label.</p>
<p>The newest sign of those plans come via <a href="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/steam_brandGuidelines.pdf">newly updated branding guidelines</a> posted by Valve on Wednesday (as noticed by <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamworksDocumentation/compare/d54725a035de...41944930ea8a#diff-5daae83579359a756437d0a949cfce0a729a6857724a1740b2825f45fd0d9292">the trackers at SteamDB</a>). That update includes the first appearance of a new "Powered by SteamOS" logo intended "for hardware running the SteamOS operating system, implemented in close collaboration with Valve."</p>
<p>The document goes on to clarify that the new Powered by SteamOS logo "indicates that a hardware device will run the SteamOS and boot into SteamOS upon powering on the device." That's distinct from the licensed branding for merely "Steam Compatible" devices, which include "non-Valve input peripherals" that have been reviewed by Valve to work with Steam.</p>
<p>The new guidelines replace <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/steamworks_docs/english/Steam_Guidelines_060222.pdf">an older set of branding guidelines</a>, last revised in late 2017, that included detailed instructions for how to use the old "Steam Machines" name and logo on third-party hardware. That branding has been functionally defunct for years, making Valve's apparent need to suddenly update it more than a little suspect.</p>

can be turned on by setting the "Raytracing Quality" option to "Full Reflections + RTGI," and then choosing a quality level under "RTGI Quality." The feature will surely require high-end hardware and impact your frame rate, so Nvidia suggests enabling either DLSS or DLAA to help compensate.</p><p>The Forza series has been utilized by Nvidia many times to show off new graphical technology. Last year, Nvidia added DLSS 3 support to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-adds-dlss-3-support-just-ahead-of-new-dlc-launch/1100-6512760/" data-ref-id="1100-6512760">Forza Horizon 5</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-4-delists-in-december-dlc-delists-today/1100-6524496/" data-ref-id="1100-6524496">Forza Horizon 4 is also being delisted</a> and removed from Game Pass later this month on December 15, so be sure to grab it while you still can.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-review/1900-6418125/" data-ref-id="1900-6418125">Forza Motorsport review</a>, we said, "Forza Motorsport is a triumphant return for the simulation racing series, and it has never been as approachable or rewarding."</p>

As the <em>Kotaku </em>staff rolled into Slack, we shared our respective results, and the stark difference between how some of us consume music got two of our writers reflecting on their music-listening habits. They are both wondering if they just listen to music in bizarre ways, or if it‚Äôs everyone else who is wrong, actually. You be the judge. But also be nice.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-recommend-id="image://4fd1451cf6dc477b050191ea9fee9a93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Sabrina Carpenter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/spotify-wrapped-minutes-listened-top-artists-1851059532">Spotify Wrapped</a></span>. At least, I do the moment I boot up the music-streaming app and see all the statistics and rankings encompassing a year of listening habits. It‚Äôs only when I start seeing other people‚Äôs Wrappeds that I feel like I might be slightly insane. I spend every 12 months wondering what I‚Äôm going to see in the mirror Spotify holds up at the end of the year, and my 2024 wasn‚Äôt particularly surprising in a vacuum. My most played song was Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù because I‚Äôm gay and have immaculate taste. Just how much have I listened to the tune since the <em>Short n‚Äô Sweet </em>singer released it in April? 1582 times.</p><p>Friends, I realize that probably sounds excessive. Literally seconds after I posted about my Spotify Wrapped on social media, I was met with reactions from people gobsmacked by how many times I‚Äôd heard Carpenter singing about the Nintendo Switch (but not actually). Then, as I scrolled through other people‚Äôs Wrapped, I saw the majority of people‚Äôs most-played songs had only been played a couple dozen times over the course of 12 months. On top of that, my overall Spotify usage was in the six figures. I spent 129,053 minutes listening to music on Spotify, about three months of non-stop music in my ears. Once again, this dwarfed most people‚Äôs average play time, which landed around five figures or less.</p><p>These ridiculous statistics require some context. For one, I always have music playing if I‚Äôm not talking to someone, and even then, it‚Äôs probably playing in the background. That means while I‚Äôm writing for this here website, playing non-narrative games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, or commuting through New York City, my Spotify is blasting something into my ears. Again, Spotify Wrapped reminds me not many people operate this way, and I simply don‚Äôt know how the rest of y‚Äôall are white-knuckling life without music. What am I supposed to do, listen to the sounds of NYC traffic jams?</p><p>But my total playtime is probably less surprising than the 1500 listens to ‚ÄúEspresso.‚Äù That can be explained by me listening to songs on repeat for hours on end. Sometimes I‚Äôll listen to a song nonstop for a day or two, then move on to something else, then come back to that song for another stretch of relentless listening. The song of the moment is Coheed &amp; Cambria‚Äôs ‚ÄúSearching For Tomorrow,‚Äù which has had a few of these dedicated windows of repeat listening in the time since the prog rock band released it last month. Is there <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://medium.com/illumination/autism-music-on-repeat-1ac474e184f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possibly something undiagnosed</a></span> underneath there? Could be. But my music-listening habits have always been this way. When I was young, if I didn‚Äôt like a full album I‚Äôd spent money on, I‚Äôd probably have the songs I did like on a loop, and the rise of digital music and streaming services has only exacerbated this approach.</p><p>To be clear, this isn‚Äôt exclusively how I listen to music. But over the years, I‚Äôve always sought out ways to listen to songs on repeat. When I used YouTube as a primary music source, I had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://listenonrepeat.com/?v=Y5WQ6gF-8vA#Wel_e_to_ListenOnRepeat_-_World_s_%231_YouTube_Looper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">external websites open to play songs I was really vibing with on a loop</a></span>. I remember I stopped using Soundcloud as often when they made it impossible to find their repeat button for a brief window of time. Part of it is just my personality. I tend to hyperfixate. Growing up, I used to go see a movie that I enjoyed multiple times in theaters and replay games multiple times without getting tired of them. So it‚Äôs natural that tendency would bleed into how I listen to music as well. But part of it is this job. I start to attach certain feelings or games to specific songs or artists, and will listen to them on repeat so it keeps me in the right headspace. Music is so often an extension of my mood that a song landing in my most-listened-to playlist is as much a statement about how I felt that year as it is about the quality of the song.</p><p>‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù was my go-to gym song for much of the year. Since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moving to NYC</a></span>, I finally made the jump to becoming a gym rat, and I tend to listen to a lot of pop girlies during my workouts because half the reason you go to the gym is to get more confident in how you look. So yeah, I listened to a sexy little pop song half the time because it got me in my groove. Couple that with the song being relatively short (just under three minutes) and it naturally ends up getting a couple dozen plays by the end of the workout. The same goes for Charli XCX and Billie Eilish‚Äôs ‚ÄúGuess‚Äù Remix. Nothing gets me more pumped for cable flys than a bumpin‚Äô pop song. It‚Äôs the same effect metal or hip-hop has on the average straight dude.</p><p>But my top-played artists aren‚Äôt all pop girlies, though Sabrina, Charli, and Chappell Roan all ended up in my top five. Yes, yes, I know I‚Äôm gay, Spotify. Chill. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/coheed-and-cambria-deranged-joke-single-batman-arkham-1851463330">Coheed &amp; Cambria‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Joke‚Äù</a></span> was my second-most-played song, though Spotify won‚Äôt give me a number on how many times it was played. It was the return of my favorite band, and the fact that they managed to end up in my top five artists this year on the back of three singles leading up to their new album next year is a testament to how many times those songs were spun. Jon Bellion, probably my favorite pop artist right now, hasn‚Äôt put out an album for six years, so his new, melancholy single about rediscovering his inner child, ‚ÄúKid Again,‚Äù was on loop for several days as I wrung his soulful vocals out for every last drop.</p><p>Eventually, these songs do make their way out of the rotation, but I have been blessed with the uncanny ability to never truly tire of these songs. I remember friends in high school being frankly kind of shitty to me for being able to listen to songs on a loop in my headphones, as if that had any bearing on their lives. Looking back, it was probably less about them being subjected to a song non-stop than it was the idea that someone listened to music differently. I had earbuds in, what did it matter to them what they were playing?</p><p>Without context, my Spotify Wrapped usually looks insane every year. But looking back at the way I listen to music, I try not to read into it too much. I just know everyone who sees it in passing probably wonders how the hell someone can listen to a funky pop song about Not Coffee hundreds of times without wanting to tear their ears out. And to that I say: If you can‚Äôt still love a song after hearing it dozens, hundreds, or apparently thousands of times, that‚Äôs a skill issue. Sorry. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I‚Äôm gonna go put ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù on for the 1583rd time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spotify</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-recommend-id="image://49bafe836badee97eb854631197a4950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="1920" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Spotify Wrapped graphic featuring an image of Marble Sounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Looking at everyone else‚Äôs Spotify Wrapped makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing it wrong. (If I were being more honest, I‚Äôd say that it makes me feel like everyone else but me is doing it wrong, but I won‚Äôt admit to that.) As <em>Kotaku</em> writers shared their summaries of their most-listened-to songs from 2024 in our Slack, Kenneth reported that he‚Äôd listened to Sabrina Carpenter‚Äôs ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù some 1,582 times. My most played song‚Äî‚ÄúYoung Fathers‚Äù by Typhoon‚Äîhad been streamed by me 17 times.</p><p>If you asked me to sing ‚ÄúYoung Fathers‚Äù by Typhoon, I‚Äôd have genuinely replied, ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I absolutely wouldn‚Äôt have known that was the name of the band, nor even the name of the track, but playing it back, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I really like how this sounds!‚Äù I‚Äôd added it to my Liked Songs playlist (currently 1,622 songs long) and I guess it came up 17 times over the year. I‚Äôve no idea who Typhoon are, if they‚Äôre wonderful progressives championed by the youth, or some problematic bunch of old bastards only liked by actual Nazis. It‚Äôs just a song that made a nice noise, so I listened to it. (I‚Äôve got it on right now, and it‚Äôs a great pop track, with a whole host of catchy riffs, but I‚Äôve never paid attention to the lyrics.)</p><p>According to Spotify, I‚Äôve listened to a total of 5,232 songs this year, by 1,992 different artists. And, apparently, this isn‚Äôt very normal? It kept telling me I was in the top 0.5 percent of various bands‚Äô listenerships, which feels incredibly stalkerish, and confuses me even further given how infrequently I‚Äôd apparently streamed any single track. But it‚Äôs likely because of this width instead of depth that my top five artists included, in fifth place, Eels.</p><p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI love Eels. I loved them in 1996 with Beautiful Freak, a CD I recorded to cassette and then listened to on a loop on my Walkman during a summer spent mowing fields in a Scottish outdoor activity center. I loved Electro-Shock Blues (well, as much as that gut-punch of an album can be loved), and the incredible Daisies of the Galaxy in 2000, and Souljacker in 2002, and then‚Ä¶I drifted off. I hadn‚Äôt listened to them in 20 years! I spent a couple of days listening to a bunch of their more recent albums, stuck a few of the tracks on my Liked Songs list, and that was that. And apparently that made the band my fifth highest choice!</p><p>The rest of the top five isn‚Äôt as surprising to me, even if it reveals that I still just listen to what comic writer and former colleague Kieron Gillen always describes as ‚ÄúJohn Walker music.‚Äù (It‚Äôs a derogatory term.) In first place is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marblesounds.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marblesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marble Sounds</a></span>, and that makes perfect sense. The Belgian singer‚Äôs music is my ‚Äúhappy‚Äù place, something I put on when I need to feel the perpetual ennui of life reflected back to me in beautiful sounds. Second place is The Mountain Goats, and again, the only surprise is that it‚Äôs not first place. Alongside Nick Cave, John Darnielle is my favorite singer, and The Mountain Goats is the band I‚Äôve seen live the most times. If I had to pick only one artist I was allowed to listen to, it‚Äôd be him or Cave, depending on the day. Third is Radical Face, and again, that‚Äôs a go-to artist for me (alongside another Ben Cooper vehicle, Electric President, with Alex Kane), since I discovered him in 2017 via the extraordinary video-EP, ‚ÄúSunnMoonnEclippse.‚Äù</p><p>But from then on, it‚Äôs a free-for-all. There are tracks I am convinced I listened to vastly more often than those listed in my top five songs, including whoever Typhoon are. Like French ‚Äúelectro-swing band‚Äù Caravan Palace‚Äôs incredible ditty ‚ÄúMiracle,‚Äù that despite being five years old I only heard for the first time this year via some TV show.</p><p>Also, I‚Äôm convinced I listened to A House‚Äôs 1994 track ‚ÄúWhy Me‚Äù more than 17 times on the same day a couple of weeks ago. Although, at least the appearance of ‚ÄúA Wave Across A Bay‚Äù in second place for songs represents just how much I‚Äôve listened to Frank Turner this year. If I‚Äôd had to guess, I‚Äôd have assumed it‚Äôd have been the deeply moving song about anxiety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBwxy-JT7Pw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt Been Doing So Well,‚Äù</a></span> or his wonderful song ‚ÄúMiranda,‚Äù about restoring his broken relationship with his dad (the agreed term between them) after she came out as trans.</p><p>Also, where‚Äôs Busdriver? Where‚Äôs Aesop Rock? Where‚Äôs Nick Cave? Where‚Äôs Noname? And the rest of the artists I feel like I put on more often than others?</p><p>OK, I‚Äôm done just crowbarring in favorite songs to make you listen to them‚ÄîI‚Äôll get back to the point‚Ä¶</p><p>As tempting as it is to crown myself as Captain Iconoclastic, having found my own niche of middle-of-the-road middle-aged men to listen to, it leaves me feeling a bit alienated. My wife and son sing along to any song they hear in public, but they‚Äôre all new to me. When Kenneth shared his top five, I genuinely asked who Sabrina Carpenter is. It turns out I know the track ‚ÄúEspresso,‚Äù and have deliberately listened to it a few times as it‚Äôs a great piece of pop, but I had no idea who sang it‚Äîeven though I remember her lackluster performance of it on SNL.</p><p>When I was younger, I‚Äôd have taken dumb pride in this. Ooh, look at me, I don‚Äôt even know the big pop hits, aren‚Äôt I so <em>very interesting</em>. But as I get dangerously close to 50, I realize that, no, I‚Äôm just missing out. Admittedly, this is in large part driven by my wife and son endlessly repeating the same bloody Taylor Swift and Chappell Roan songs, which might be perfectly fantastic, but I‚Äôve involuntarily heard them so many times they‚Äôve become like sandpaper on my brain.</p><p>And I guess it‚Äôs that last part that traps me in my weird situation: I don‚Äôt want to hear the same song a billion times. Kenneth listened to ‚ÄúEspresso‚Äù 1,500 times in a year. That sounds like a punishment to me, and as I already said, I think it‚Äôs a great track! But damn, 30 times and I‚Äôd not want to listen to it again for a good few years. I want something brand new more than I want an old familiar. As soon as something is broadly popular, I hear it even when I don‚Äôt want to, and I begin to resent it. It‚Äôs <em>imposed</em> on me. It‚Äôs fair to say that with 272 monthly listeners on Spotify, another regular favorite, Trouble Books, aren‚Äôt going to be played when I go into the department store. (Listen to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58RFslkOLjQ&amp;pp=ygUYdHJvdWJsZSBib29rcyBncmF2ZWwgcGl0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄúGravel Pit‚Äù</a></span> right now, you bastards.)</p><p>So am I the weirdo? Or is it Kenneth? I like to assume that it‚Äôs probably both of us, given we felt so compelled to worry about it that we wrote this article.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-the-hero-building-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible is a comic famed for its unusually high levels of gore and character mortality. Back in 2021 it got an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/invincible">animated TV treatment</a>, expanding its fan base considerably and opening the door to other spin off products such as this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>. In the show, the protagonists are teenagers, struggling to learn how to use their powers to defend the world after a massacre of older, more experienced superheros. So here, you get to create them from the ground up in Invincible: The Hero-Building Game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What‚Äôs in the Box</h2><div catalogid="cf173c02-dce9-4297-8045-212cb71eef3c" id="209856"><div id="209856" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it‚Äôs very much a board game, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game doesn‚Äôt have much of a board. Instead of anything fold-out, there are three separate boards that sit next to one another, representing three different areas of wherever the scenario you‚Äôre playing takes place. Each has spaces for heroes, villains, minions and civilians. They‚Äôre very basic, presumably so that they work as whatever location you‚Äôre supposed to be in, but they‚Äôre perfectly functional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assuming you like the style of the original Invincible comic, the remainder of the components are much more engaging. There are standees for the four playable heroes, plus Omni-man, lots of civilian and minion tokens, and multiple decks of cards for things like events, villains and hero powers, all resplendent with licensed comic art from Invincible, although the typography on the cards is a little gauche.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from various cardboard and wooden markers, the other components are related directly to the playable heroes and scenarios, with a tracking board for each of these, again festooned in relevant comic art. With all those panels assembled together on the tabletop, your play area begins to look like a comic book in and of itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather than a point-by-point rulebook, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game walks you through the introductory scenario step by step, and then has an addendum for more advanced rules. This is a divisive approach, but it works well here, allowing you to get into the basics of the game with a minimum of fuss. Everyone picks a hero from the available roster of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode and Robot, seeds a bag with a variety of colored cubes, and dives in, working together to save the globe from an alien invasion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three board areas, each one of which has spaces for heroes, villains and a mass of innocent bystanders, who fluctuate between safe and dangerous zones. On your turn you‚Äôll start by drawing three cubes from your bag and assigning them to your hero powers, allowing you to do things like move, attack, or rescue civilians. Colored cubes have to be assigned to matching color powers: yellow is fighting, for instance, while blue tends to be more about rescue and recovery. Black cubes are wild and can be assigned anywhere, but there‚Äôs a catch: you can keep drawing and assigning cubes as long as you like, but if you get more than four black cubes, you‚Äôre exhausted and out of the round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We‚Äôve seen this kind of push-your-luck bag-drawing before in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg</a>, and it‚Äôs really fun. By allowing players to control their own risk, it offers a neat balance of excitement and strategy. But it‚Äôs particularly good here because most hero powers require more than one cube to activate, meaning you‚Äôve got to be incredibly careful about your priorities. If you really, really want to attack this round, it‚Äôs tempting to throw black cubes into your yellow powers, but then yellow cubes drawn are less useful. And on the flip side, if you haven‚Äôt quite filled and activated a power when you close in on that five-cube limit, those you‚Äôve assigned will be wasted unless you risk another draw.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs superpowered swings and roundabouts and the right choice is situational, depending on whether you‚Äôre on the verge of taking out an enemy, or suffering a catastrophic number of civilian deaths. Running it close to the line when there‚Äôs a critical outcome on the line is hugely exciting and, as a bonus, it alleviates the common pitfall of cooperative play where the most experienced player directs the others. It‚Äôs your turn, it‚Äôs your bag, and it‚Äôs up to you how risky you want to play it, then down to fate whether you‚Äôll live up to your character‚Äôs heroics or blow it for the whole team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After all the players have finished drawing cubes and taking actions, it‚Äôs on to the training phase. You‚Äôll each have a hand of five cards representing potential superpowers your teenage hero might learn to manifest. Orange cubes drawn during your turn can be assigned to confidence, which is essentially a currency you can use to buy these cards. This adds a whole new layer of strategy to proceedings as you look for combos between your starting powers, those in your hand and the cubes in your bag, a multi-way mash-up of bag-building and tableau building from an enormous deck of powers, for a colossal amount of variety and strategic flex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as this is, it does leave some thematic question marks hanging over the game. While the heroes do grapple with learning their powers in the comic, the idea that it‚Äôs a revolving door of different abilities they can try on for size and discard feels like a stretch too far. Similarly, while each hero starts with a signature purple power keyed to their abilities ‚Äì Rex Splode can damage all enemies in the vicinity with an explosion, for example ‚Äì there‚Äôs nothing to stop you choosing a roster of entirely unrelated powers to go along with it. You could make Rex, who is selfish and reckless in the source material, a caring, sharing support character with lots of healing and buff powers if you so wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible: The Hero Building Game earns back some thematic brownie points in the villain phase. Here, you draw an event card that has different instructions for villains and their minions, which will see them damaging heroes, killing civilians and using special powers, at least until such time as you do enough damage to them to get them off the board. You may also get a boost from some outside help, or include optional challenges like having to zap back and meet shifts at work to make things even tougher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each scenario has a selection of randomly drawn and scenario-specific enemies that enter play as the game progresses, as well as some thematic special rules. The whole package gives each scenario plenty of thematic heft as well as variety for replay value. In the second scenario, for instance, you‚Äôll face the annoying Doc Seismic, who won‚Äôt enter play until the final round, giving you limited time to defeat him. And in the meantime, you‚Äôll have to watch out for him accumulating damage to Mount Rushmore, which will lose you the game if it takes too much. Other ways you can lose include an excessive civilian death toll, or too many hero knock-outs from enemy damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To try and avoid this fate, you‚Äôve always got the option to fly back to HQ and rest up, recovering some health and your defiance token, a handy option that lets you re-draw cubes if you don‚Äôt like what you pulled. However, doing so takes you away from the frontline, so this is very much robbing Peter to pay Paul, as while you‚Äôre away, your team-mates and civilians will be left to face the punishment. But this is typical of the game, which does a great job of keeping the tension high and making you feel like you‚Äôre stretched too thin, walking a strategic knife-edge between victory and defeat. And this matches the tone of the comic, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XGoe?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVpj4?object_uuid=b8a983c9-a9b2-4db4-b179-108341944395&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Dire Wolf</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 5, 2024 3:51 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Whatever your feelings on the source material, Invincible: The Hero-Building Game is a cut above its cooperative peers in the board gaming world. Despite a few thematic and presentational miss-steps, it generates a fitting emergent narrative for the comics that it‚Äôs based on. Perhaps more importantly, it‚Äôs a compelling challenge, with lots of cool combos to dig for in your quest to save the world again and again, thanks to plenty of variety and optional difficulty tweaks. It even manages to encourage genuine cooperation as you work through tactical plans and bring them to the table, leaving the final risk up to the individual. It's an impressive package, which deserves to build its own heroic niche in the wider world of comic book board games.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-foamstars-next-season-will-be-its-last-but-the-game-will-remain-online<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix has announced the next season of its live service shooter Foamstars will be the last, though the game will remain online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> revealed the Party Goes On season, which begins December 13 and runs until January 17, will be the final season of Foamstars but Square Enix will continue to support the game in a handful of other ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix will introduce "expansions" that will "enhance gameplay, such as the ability to customise shots of each character, and new enhancement elements, such as Prism Gems, all aimed at ensuring players can continue to enjoy the game for the foreseeable future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Foamstars Cup will also be hosted across a series of events named after each character, which presumably means eight separate events since there are eight player characters in the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Foamstars Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, to ensure that new players can fully enjoy Foamstars, previous Season Passes will be made available again," Square Enix said. "Players can switch between Season Passes at any time to proceed along the Season Pass track of your choice and obtain items from past seasons. This will make it possible for players to obtain all the items from each season."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this isn't as disastrous a move as a full shutdown which other triple-A live service games have suffered recently, the removal of seasons certainly doesn't bode well for the future of Foamstars. Square Enix only released the game in February, meaning the dedicated live service support that was seasons will come to end less than one year after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars debuted to a middling reception and Square Enix seemingly hasn't been able to turn interest around. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/foamstars-review">It earned a 6/10 in IGN's review</a>, in which we said: "Foamstars' combat mechanics are unexpectedly engaging, but confounding time-gated modes and aggressive monetization make them harder to enjoy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live service games such as Foamstars have had a rough year, with many falling to reach high levels of engagement. The model is so attractive to publishers as, instead of just making a single payment to buy a game, players are given a continuous stream of purchasing options such as battle passes, season passes, and other microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A live service boom of sorts has occurred in the video game industry as a result of incredibly successful games such as Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys, but many publishers have seemingly fallen short by looking to capitalize immediately instead of building up a dedicated audience first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Foamstars may be included in this list, though others such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League have also fallen flat. The most infamous live service game of the year, however, and perhaps ever, is in PlayStation hero shooter Concord.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It debuted to a tragic 697 peak concurrent players on Steam, a number that made the 12,786 players of the aforementioned Suicide Squad, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">was dubbed a disappointment by Warner Bros. Discovery</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">caused a $200 million hit to revenue</a>, look like a titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony then made the decision to shut down the game less than two weeks after launch</a>, and while some debated a potential return, all hopes were dashed when developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios was shut down a few weeks later</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Far from simply updating the game's visuals and adding some modern quality-of-life features, Blizzard is also taking a look at gameplay balance.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZ2jiW95qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ryZ2jiW95qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Most of the changes in the new <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/warcraft-ii-remastered-patch-notes-101/52999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraft 2: Remastered patch 1.0.1</a> are related to resource costs and ability durations for various units. Archers and Axe Throwers have received some significant changes to their upgrades, which are now faster to research, deal more damage, and cost less gold and (in most cases) lumber to learn. Paladins have received some slight buffs, as have Death Knights.</p><p dir="ltr">One huge change players seem happy with is a nerf to the Ogre Mage's Bloodlust ability, long regarded as overpowered for those playing as the Horde and an ability without a good Alliance alternative. The ability doubles the damage and piercing damage of a selected unit for a set duration, allowing Bloodlusted units to cut through even heavily armored foes with ease.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-patch 1.0.1, Bloodlust has had its duration decreased, its mana cost increased, and had its double-damage buff applied after armor reduction instead of before. The ability will still be extremely valuable, but it's at least not quite as omnipotent as before.</p><p dir="ltr">These balance changes are the first major gameplay updates to the beloved RTS since the arrival of patch 2.02 for the 1999 Battle.net version of Warcraft 2. I wasn't able to find an exact date for when 2.02 released, but given the Battle.net version of Warcraft 2's October 1999 release, it likely came a few months later or sometime in 2000. That makes the Warcraft 2: Remastered balance changes the first for the RTS in roughly 24 or 25 years.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the balance changes, the update additionally re-adds the game's classic Victory/Defeat screens and animations, adds an Alliance menu for online multiplayer, introduces countdowns to matches when waiting in a multiplayer lobby, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Classic game storefront GOG recently announced Blizzard would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-delisted-on-gog-december-13-folllowing-blizzard-remasters/1100-6528156/" data-ref-id="1100-6528156">pulling the non-remastered versions of Warcraft 1 and 2 from sale on December 13</a>. Despite the fact they will soon be delisted, GOG said it would continue to provide tech support for both games to ensure compatibility for future versions of Windows.</p>
