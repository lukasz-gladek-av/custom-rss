<p>As well as the games themselves, <em>CorgiSpace </em>also offers developer diaries to show you how each game was made. Charmingly, Finji says some of these games "can even save progress". Imagine!</p><p>Games you can check out as part of <em>CorgiSpace </em>include run-based puzzler <em>Kuiper Cargo</em>, "mini roguelike" <em>Cave of Cards</em>, and <em>Mole Mole</em>, a sokoban puzzler with an explosive twist.</p><p>It's not just <em>CorgiSpace </em>Finji is announcing, either. If you're interested in making your own micro-style games, the studio is hosting a game jam between today and January 11th. It'll wrap up with a stream in the week of January 19th, during which Finji staffers and guests will play some of the games created as part of the jam.</p><p>If you want to get a sense for what <em>CorgiSpace </em>will play like and what you can expect from the collection, you can check out a trailer here.</p>

Rose <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikerose.bsky.social/post/3m7hr6fuv5c2l" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">points</a> to another review that accuses <em>Little Rocket Lab </em>of featuring "forced politics" and of "force-fe[eding]" the player "DEI nonsense", also pointing to a review for <em>Yes, Your Grace </em>in which the reviewer claims the second part of the game "jam[s] in...DEI crap".</p><p>There are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001374812/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Privacy%20Policy%20Legal%20Accessibility%20Cookies%20Steam%20Subscriber%20Agreement%20%C2%A9%20Valve%20Corporation.%20https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026506561/recommended/2451100/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reviews</a> making similar complaints to the one Rose has flagged as well, with Rose lamenting that "this is where we're at now" with Steam reviews and that the rejection constitutes a confirmation that Valve believes "I don't like Muslims" is "a valid reason to leave a negative review" on a Steam game.</p><p>It's tempting to slap the libertarian label on Valve and call it a day, but recent movements by the company with regards to games on Steam would suggest that isn't the case.</p><p>Recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horses-steam-ban-indie-horror" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a11cd5-8771-4a5c-86ba-ff196e272f59" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie horror game <em>Horses </em>was banned</a> from Steam and no explanation was offered to developer Santa Ragione, and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d619c44-1572-4d4c-9fdf-64af4c3b37db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">not the only horror game with controversial themes</a> to be banned from the platform in recent memory either.</p><figure role="group">

		<p>Skeleton Crew and developer Panic Stations have announced Frog Sqwad, a slapstick physics-based multiplayer game for up to eight players.</p>
<p><iframe title="???? Frog Sqwad ???? Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2BGF12nGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a frog with a sticky tongue, and that’s how you’ll get around and solve puzzles in Frog Sqwad. You’ll swing from pipes, drag giant food through tunnels, catapult friends, grow in size to become a megafrog, and more. Why are you doing this? Why are you and all your buddies in the sewers? That’s because of the Swamp King.</p>
<p>The Swamp King is endlessly hungry, and will demand for more and more food each and every day. You’ll go on runs, trying to earn gold to unlock more physics toys and gadgets, and just try to keep meeting quota.</p>
<p>Frog Sqwad – this is seriously hard to type out and not get letters jumbled up – is the first project from newly founded studio Panic Stations, which has been founded by a clutch of ex-Fall Guys developers who just want to make co-op games.</p>

<p>This game – that’s much easier to type – will be launching in 2026, but wait! You can play it tomorrow! A Steam Playtest will start on 11th December and runs through the weekend.</p>

<p>When Epic Games released Fortnite in July 2017, it didn't know at the time that it was about to change the video game world forever. Of course, it didn't change everything overnight. In fact, it didn't even change things with that initial launch. It wasn't <a href="http://wccftech.com/fortnite-battle-royale-mode-release-standalone-free-next-week/">until the battle royale mode launched a couple of months later in September 2017</a> that the real change started to occur.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2025, and Fortnite has been a phenomenon like no other. Here's everything we know about the battle royale phenomenon turned platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Fortnite was initially released on July 21, 2017, though the mode that made the game famous, its battle royale mode, wouldn't arrive until September 12, 2017. It has always been a free-to-play game, with in-game microtransactions available for players. It was initially available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, though over time<a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ps5-xbox-series-x/"> it has been made available on every current-gen console platform </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">mobile device available</a>. Fortnite is everywhere you want it to be in 2025, with ways to play the game on almost any device you like, no matter its hardware capabilities.</p>



<p>Every premium microtransaction in Fortnite is made with its in-game premium currency called V-Bucks, which can be purchased in bundles of 1,000, 2,800, 5,000, and 13,500. V-Bucks can go on sale and have increased in price in the past, but the current pricing for each bundle is:</p>



<ul>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks=$8.99 USD</li>



<li>2,800 V-Bucks=$22.99 USD</li>



<li>5,000 V-Bucks=$36.99 USD</li>



<li>13,500 V-Bucks=$89.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>In-game skins, battle passes, and premium collaborations will be priced in V-Bucks, and like most live service games that came after Fortnite, V-Bucks can only be purchased in bundles that put you just below being able to acquire a premium skin, or force you to purchase more V-Bucks then you'd need, leaving you with a surplus (though not necessarily enough to buy two premium items).</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Nowadays, it's difficult to put Fortnite into a particular genre, because the reality is, when you throw in Fortnite Creative mode and the Fortnite Islands you can visit, Fortnite is any genre of game you want it to be. It's a racer, a rhythm game, a first-person shooter, a third-person shooter, a platformer. Whatever you want to build, Fortnite can become that.</p>



<p>But to keep things simple, let's stick to the core gameplay modes that made the game as popular as it is. Fortnite is a third-person battle royale shooter, where players are not only managing their weapon loadouts, but building and deconstructing wooden structures for a myriad of gameplay possibilities. Though mostly players build towers for extra cover and an extremely tall sniper's nest. </p>



<p>The storyline, which is there, however extrapolated it is, began with a simple premise. A company called IO created an island connecting every reality;100 players go in, one comes out, and the loop repeats. That also conveniently made it eternally easy for Epic Games to do every collaboration under the sun and get whatever characters you can think of into Fortnite.</p>



<p>That is at least how it started, all the way back in what's now known as Chapter 1, which includes the first eleven seasons, including Season 0. Now, we're all the way in Chapter 7, with each chapter including at least four seasons, if not more, so you can imagine how much has happened.</p>



<p>But the basic premise of Fortnite being set in a battle royale island that connects every reality ever has not changed, and will not change, so long as more characters from franchises you love can be made into Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-chapter-and-season-in-fortnite-so-far">Every Chapter and Season in Fortnite so far </h2>



<p>This section will continuously be updated, because Fortnite is consistently getting new seasons and eventually new chapters. So this list is always only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Like every season before it, Season 1 of Chapter 7 includes a few new things for players to keep in mind. A new island, the addition of Storm Surfing, and most importantly for players, self-revives. The new island, Golden Coast, turns the latest map into a Fortnite version of Hollywood, and features a Quentin Tarantino collaboration <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">that also made history for fans of Tarantino's work, specifically his Kill Bill movies</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Describing the gameplay in Fortnite in 2025 runs into the same problems you have when trying to decide what genre to put the game in. Technically, the gameplay can be a whole host of things because of Fortnite Islands, which let you jump from entirely different kinds of games made within Fortnite, made either by Epic Games, other professional development studios, or just other users. </p>



<p>So, narrowing the scope down to just the core mode that initially put Fortnite on the map, Fortnite is a third-person battle royale action game/shooter, where players compete to be the last one standing out of 100 other competitors. You'll drop into a large map, search for loot to arm yourself, and (in the original build mode) gather resources like Wood, Stone, or Metal, to build structures that can help give you an advantage over other players with additional verticality and give you cover from opposing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Fortnite is famously not a very taxing game to run, no matter what hardware you have at your disposal. Technically speaking, with services like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Amazon Luna, and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, you can play Fortnite on any device that can connect to those services.</p>



<p>If you have the hardware for it, then you can push Fortnite pretty far, as it supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-rtx-dlss-and-reflex-on-thursday-september-17th/">ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex</a>. But part of its appeal, particularly with its visual language, is that Fortnite doesn't need to be played on top-of-the-line hardware to look fairly decent and run at a solid frame rate.</p>



<p>On Windows, here are the official technical specifications from the game's listing on the Epic Games Store:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended - Epic Quality Preset</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit version 1703</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Core i3-3225 3.3 GHz</td><td>Core i5-7300U 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen 3 3300U</td><td>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700x</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8GB </td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Intel HD 4000 / AMD Radeon Vega 8</td><td>NVIDIA GTX 960 / AMD R9 280 or equivalent DX11 GPU</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>100+ GB available (SSD strongly recommended)</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Fortnite is not available on Mac, though you can still play it on a Mac through the aforementioned cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications for Fortnite on Android devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor</li>



<li>Android OS 10.0 or higher</li>



<li>Minimum 4GB of RAM</li>



<li>GPU:
<ul>
<li>Adreno 530 or higher</li>



<li>Mali-G71 MP20</li>



<li>Mali-G72 MP12 or higher</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For iOS users, Fortnite is compatible with your device so long as you have at least 4GB of RAM and are running iOS 17.6.1 or higher. As a standard rule, iPhone 11 or higher models are compatible, save for the iPhone SE Generation 2 phones (iPhone SE 2020), which come with only 3GB of RAM.</p>

After the original source code was donated by Oberth’s family to the Video Game History Foundation, the game was rebuilt in partnership with Mega Cat Studios. and Incredible Technologies agreed to donate the rights to the Video Game History Foundation to preserve the game intellectual property and aid the charity’s fundraising for its work within the videogames industry. Through a collective effort rooted in passion and altruism, <em>Xcavator</em> is now finished, staying true to Oberth’s original vision, using the same tools that would’ve been used to fully develop the title in 1991.</p><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>CorgiSpace has been revealed by Canabalt creator Adam “Atomic” Saltsman, a collection of original Pico-8 sized games that have “short legs” on purpose. It’s available now from Steam and itch.io.</p>
<p><iframe title="CorgiSpace | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaH_5CDT7Vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been at Finji for a good long while and helped create larger games such as Night in the Woods and Tunic, Adam Atomic felt like getting back to smaller experiences, and started to create little quirky games based off quick and funny ideas.</p>
<p>There’s more than a dozen games in the collection, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat Dreams – a soulslike where you have to dodge roll everywhere</li>
<li>Dust Settlers – a tetris-like where you’re terraforming planets</li>
<li>Skeleton Gelatin – a metroidvania with no upgrades or jumping</li>
<li>Prince of Prussia – a game where you’re stabbing Nazis, but in a fun way</li>
<li>Vampire vs. Pope Army</li>
<li>Dust Bunny – Eat all the dust</li>
<li>Dermis – Shoot asteroid and save the Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more beyond that.</p>

<p>You should be able to explore each game in under an hour, but some of them with –&nbsp;<em>gasp –&nbsp;</em>save your progress!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funktronic Labs has revealed Scramble Knights Royale, a game that essentially blends together the Zelda-like adventure genre with the battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scramble Knights Royale - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMWryL7--F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game start you off with a steam boat that chuffs around the battle island, and when you choose to depart, you’ll surf on the back of a turtle to make it to land. From there, you’ll do all the Zelda-like things of grabbing loot, delving into dungeons and fighting bosses. That rewards you with better gear, secondary abilities, blacksmith upgrades and more.</p>
<p>It will eventually come to a head where you face off against the other players that have done the same in other parts of the world. Will you have grabbed enough upgrades and abilities to beat them?</p>
<p>Scramble Knights Royale has a claymation art style to go with the top-down view of the world, which looks delightful. The game is obviously online, but there’s also local split-screen, so you can team up on the same system. That’s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The game is still deep in development, but if this piqued your interest, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379350/Scramble_Knights_Royale/">ask to join the Steam Playtest</a> from its store page.</p>

            <p>
I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.

            <title><![CDATA[Light Up The Town Is The Perfect Cozy Christmas Lights Simulator]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213</link>
            <guid>1378852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652227">©Meadow Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Light Up the Town’</em>s decorating controls are finicky at times, but mostly work great and let you quickly cover areas in lights and other decorations, like presents, candy canes, and more. I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has been confirmed to show up at the 2025 Game Awards. Season 5.5 is right around the corner, and there’s plenty that could be revealed for the game’s future. </p>



<p>The latest playable character for Marvel Rivals has just been teased, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-rogues-vanguard-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue is set to join the fray</a>. It’s the third consecutive season that a new vanguard has been added into the mix, but that doesn’t stop fans from wanting to know more about the future of the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-will-be-at-the-game-awards">Marvel Rivals Will Be At The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Geoff Keighley, who shared a promotional image featuring Jeff the Land Shark sitting in a theatre seat marked with both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> branding. The artwork is loaded with personality, featuring Blade looking unimpressed in the background, Emma Frost sitting casually beside Jeff, and Gambit and Rogue sharing a kiss behind them—a playful nod to both the game’s tone and its growing roster.</p>







<p>What Marvel Rivals will actually showcase remains a mystery. Keighley’s only caption was a teasing “Tomorrow,” leaving fans to speculate wildly. The safest bet is a deeper look at the upcoming Season 5.5, but given NetEase’s recent momentum, it wouldn’t be surprising if they have a bigger reveal planned.</p>



<p>Fans will have to tune in to the Game Awards live to find out the truth for themselves. Do you have any theories about how Marvel Rivals could showcase at the Game Awards?

Even the least expensive power station - the compact R600 - boasts a LiFePO4 battery that lasts at least 10 years before you even need to start worrying about battery degradation. Other features include both AC outlets and USB ports, solar panel hookups, and smart app functionaliy.

There's plenty of games here with Switch 2 upgrades also, and a lot are either free or included with Nintendo Switch Online. Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild are big ones, with their Switch 2 enhancements locked behind a $10 pass per game or included in Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has practically been remade thanks to a free Nintendo Switch 2 update, although I don't think Game Freak would have got away with a paid update thanks to the goodwill lost on S&amp;Vs Switch 1 performance issues. We now get a smooth 60 FPS which clocks at 4K when docked, more Pokémon appear on screen and it's a pleasure to play. The dull textures still remain, but it's the fix we were looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games like Super Mario Wonder will be getting new content and a Switch 2 performance / visual upgrade in January also. Other games will generally run and load a little better, so it's well worth having a look through and checking which titles you're missing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushie Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomy actually came up with a product to rival Squishmallows when it comes to feathersoft huggage plushies, and I'm a big fan of Mocchi Moochi.

Both of these builds are going to kill it when it comes to high frame rate 4K gaming, and I simply don't think the extra $350 is worth it for the extra gains of a Core Ultra 9 285K CPU.

Behind her, though, is Astarion, voiced by Neil Newbon, with 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. And behind him is Shadowheart, with 12 hours, 25 minutes, and 26 seconds. The smallest amount of dialogue is a many-way tie between numerous NPCs that all have only one second of dialogue, including four different Mind Flayer NPCs. In total, the game contains 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds of spoken voice lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every voice actor is catalogued in here, including small lines by random NPCs and even cut dialogue. One mystery that's arisen, per Everwhite-moonlight, is who exactly voices which Giant Rat NPC in the game. "There are four instances of a character named 'Giant Rat,' and there are four actors credited to have played 'Giant Rat.' I have separated the Giant Rat UIDs and could tell they are played by four different people, but I don't know which one is which." Those actors are Akbar Kurtha, Joseph Capp, Leemore Marrett Jr., and Sean Baker. Now we just have to sort out which actor is which rat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Baldur's Gate 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fun bit that's surfaced from this is that Larian Studios actually didn't know how much dialogue, time-wise, was in the game. On Twitter/X, Larian boss Swen Vincke shared the news about the finding, saying, "We weren’t really keeping track which I think was for the better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke did, however, know the word count of the game's script, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals">as we learned back in 2024</a>, saying that Baldur's Gate 3 has triple the word count of The Lord of the Rings, and its cutscene runtime is twice as long as HBO's Game of Thrones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn’t already heard, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing">a weird, spiky monolith in the Mojave Desert</a>. Adorned with a massive eye-like orb and a legion of demonic creatures, it’s a hint at something due to be revealed as part of The Game Awards 2025. And, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">the registration of a few new trademarks</a>, it seems like we already have the answer as to what it is: a brand new game from Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios called “Divinity”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are one of the millions of players who first learned of Larian through the gargantuan success of Baldur’s Gate 3, then the word Divinity may not mean much to you. Fans of the studio, however, will tell you that BG3’s success is rooted in Divinity, a series of six games that Larian worked on almost exclusively between 2002 and 2017. <em><strong>If</strong></em> this monolith and trademark leak really do point towards Divinity, then the Belgian studio is returning to its original fantasy universe… and likely bringing a whole new fanbase along with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If such a currently-very-much-hypothetical game would mark your first foray into the Divinity universe, then you may want a quick primer on what to expect. Let us be your guide to Divinity, and be the first to (very pre-emptively) say…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Welcome to Rivellon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-blogroll-1765383245117.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Baldur’s Gate takes place in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting of the Forgotten Realms, Divinity has its own rich, original setting: the world of Rivellon. There are broad similarities between the two; both are rooted in Tolkienesque fantasy tropes, with classically styled medieval landscapes and locations. There are multiple races; like in D&amp;D, you can expect to meet humans, elves, dwarves, lizard-like beings, and the living dead. Magic is commonplace in Rivellon, although sorcery is considered more dangerous and is more heavily regulated there than it is on D&amp;D’s Sword Coast.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Baldur’s Gate, Divinity also features a number of more esoteric elements, from steampunk to sci-fi and beyond, that make its world a little quirkier than the lands explored in more traditional fantasy like The Lord of the Rings. Rivellon can also often be a very silly place, and the influence of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels has frequently been felt in Divinity’s writing. In fact, Terry’s daughter, Rhianna Pratchett, even wrote a tie-in novella for the second game. But that’s not to say Rivellon is frivolous – there’s a deep vein of fascinating lore that has been mined over the series’ six installments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Rivellon is the stage for stories similar to those you enjoyed in Baldur’s Gate 3, but is beholden only to Larian’s rules, rather than those set by the owners of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Wizards of the Coast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Divinity?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-2-1765383400580.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity is an RPG series, but its evolution has been far from usual. Take a quick look at each of the six games, and you’ll find at least four different approaches. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, the very first game in the series, and its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-divinity">Beyond Divinity</a>, are Diablo-influenced action RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-ii-ego-draconis">Divinity 2: Ego Draconis</a>, meanwhile, is a third-person RPG that feels a <em>little </em>closer to the likes of Dragon Age and The Witcher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-dragon-commander">Divinity: Dragon Commander</a> is a <em>slightly</em> Total War-flavoured strategy game, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin">Original Sin</a> duology – the most recent games in the series – are classic-style RPGs that bear the most resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3. Larian has experimented wildly over the years, and so there’s no clear indication as to what format the next game in the series will use (although considering the success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the sensible bet would be on something similar).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unusual element is its approach to the timeline. While Rivellon does have a coherent history and storylines that are threaded across the series, each game is set years (sometimes even centuries) apart, meaning each one is something of a standalone experience. Similar to how Baldur's Gate 3 demands no experience of the series but has plenty of nods to the two earlier games, you can play Divinity: Original Sin 2 without any experience of its predecessors. I suspect any future game in the series would continue this tradition, especially since Larian now has a legion of new fans who are unfamiliar with the studio’s previous work. If the leaked trademark is to be believed, this new project is simply called “Divinity” – a name that has likely been chosen since it comes with no suggestion that you need to have played multiple other games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Does “Divinity” Mean?  </h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-logo-1765383966045.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Divinity logo, trademarked ahead of The Game Awards 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity’s name is drawn from its foundational lore. Thousands of years before the events of Divine Divinity, the first game in the series, Rivellon’s ruling body, the Council of Seven, sacrificed themselves to defend the realm from evil wizards. The “Divine Order” was established in remembrance and assigned to pass on their knowledge to the next generations.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the events of Divine Divinity, a prophecy tells of a messiah who will protect Rivellon from the next existential threat, a demon called Chaos. That messiah, it turns out, is you, and you ascend to become Lucian the Divine – a character that goes on to make appearances in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis and Divinity: Original Sin 2. The concept of the Divine is frequently explored in the stories, although it’s not the central focus of each and every game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Similar is Divinity to Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-os2-screen-1765383448435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the series has changed so much over its lifetime, most of the Divinity series is actually pretty different from what Larian created with Baldur’s Gate 3. However, the Original Sin duology is very clearly the blueprint for BG3. These are isometric RPGs set across multiple regions, with tactical turn-based combat and a similar “hands-off” approach to quest design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both are worth playing, Original Sin 2 is by far the most accomplished, both in terms of gameplay depth and narrative strength. It is where Larian pioneered the “origin story” characters that would later become the heroes of Baldur’s Gate 3, and Rivellon’s answer to the likes of Astarion, Gale, and Shadowheart are just as brilliantly written. It’s also the game in which the studio established “tags”, the system that provides character-specific dialogue options to help you better roleplay your specific race or class. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the Original Sin duology’s most lauded system is its elemental effects – cast a rain spell to make something wet, and then use a lightning ability to conduct electricity through that sodden surface. Tip over an oil barrel to create a puddle, and then shoot a flaming arrow into it to create a blaze. Stab an enemy, freeze their blood, and watch them slip on their own icy innards. Much of this elemental interplay made it into Baldur’s Gate 3, but it’s much more pronounced in Original Sin. Expect at least a quarter of your battles to result in arena-wide bonfires. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Play the Divinity Games in Order</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-dragon-commander-1765383513679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the timeline gaps that separate the Divinity games mean there are no strictly <em>direct</em> sequels, and you can more or less play them in any order you choose. If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 and are looking to learn more about Divinity, I’d only truly recommend playing Original Sin 2, which is widely regarded as the best in the series. Initially a PC exclusive, it is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and even iPad. But if you really do want to delve into the lore and explore the entire timeline, this is how you’d need to tackle the series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Dragon Commander (2013)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A grand strategy game set thousands of years prior to the events of the RPGs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin (2014)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG with turn-based combat, set 1000 years before the original game, focused on a pair of “Source Hunters” tracking down dangerous magic users.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divine Divinity (2002)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Diablo-like ARPG that chronicles the ascension of Lucian the Divine.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beyond Divinity (2004)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The ARPG sequel to Divine Divinity, set 20 years later, tells the story of one of Lucian’s servants, who has been soulbound to an evil Death Knight. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG that’s a sequel to Original Sin in terms of game design, but takes place after the original two games and deals with an outbreak of “Voidwoken” monsters in Rivellon. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity 2: Ego Draconis (2009)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A 3D action RPG set decades after Lucian’s ascension, during an era when the Divine’s adoptive son has become a tyrant, in which you play as a knight who can transform into a dragon.  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/big-hops-launches-january-12-2026-for-ps5-switch-and-pc</link>
            <guid>1378822</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>v<strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Big Hops</em> is a 3D platformer, action adventure with deep movement, fresh frog-tongue gameplay, where you can grow veggies to build paths forward!</p><p>You’ll play as Hop, a young frog who’s been kidnapped from home by a trickster spirit called Diss. He has a mysterious, important mission and needs your help, but you just want to get back to your family… After a bit of searching, a wiry old Raccoon offers to build you a way home if you can find a few Airship Parts. To build your Airship, you’ll need to:</p><ul><li>Infiltrate the Gulley Gang’s Hideout at the edge of a vast Red Desert.</li><li>Become a Bucko and save DrillCO’s Rigs Workers out on the Open Ocean.</li><li>Sneak past <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a> cultists by spelunking under a Shattered Mountain.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Each World offers a self contained story. You’ll meet a huge cast of characters, learn the conflicts of each world, and hopefully find some way to help. Will that help be altruistic or is it all selfish to get those sweet, sweet Airship Parts? Why did Diss really kidnap you? What’s the purpose behind the Dark Drips he keeps asking you to collect? And if you collect them all, will Diss really let you go home?</p><p>You’ll need to play for yourself to answer all these questions, so consider backing to help us finish BIG HOPS strong! Next let’s talk about gameplay.</p><p>Character designs by Steven Sugar (background designer for <em>Steven Universe</em> and <em>Owl House</em>).</p><p><strong>Frog Parkour</strong></p><p>Movement is king in <em>Big Hops</em> and our kit goes deep. You can roll, dive, crouch jump, wall run, free climb, swim, belly slide, walk tightropes, pole swing, grind rails, ride minecarts and more. Everyone knows a great platformer starts with a great player controller and Hops’ stacks up against the best-of-the-best.</p><p>You’ll feel inspiration from <em>Mario</em>, <em>Sonic Adventure,</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Hat in Time</em>, and more. And that’s all just Hop’s basic moveset—-from there we’ve added a ton of froggy flavor and ways to build your own paths forward.</p><p><strong>Tongue Gameplay</strong></p><p>The core-mechanic in <em>Big Hops</em> is Hop’s versatile frog tongue! It’s cute, goofy, and adds a surprising amount of freshness to this action-puzzle-platformer</p><p>Your tongue is how you interact. Use your tongue to pull items to your hands, hookshot up walls, and tongue-swing your way to ridiculous speeds.</p><p>Doors, switches, corks, plungers, flowers, flingers, levers, and lick-picking are all quick work thanks to Hop’s tongue. You’ll keep finding novel, goofy tongue interactions even over 10 hours into your playthrough.</p><p><strong>Veggie Creativity</strong></p><p>Deep movement and tongue-gameplay give BIG HOPS legs and a fresh flavor, but the real magic is using powerful Veggies to build your own paths through levels</p><p>You’ll find new types of Veggies as you explore and each has a unique effect when you throw it down in the world. Let’s look at some examples:</p><ul><li>Mushrooms become bounce pads to help clear hard jumps.</li><li>Acorns can grow vines around walls and ceilings to help you climb farther.</li><li>Balloons make temporary platforms and can stack to get serious height.</li><li>Oil Balls create hookshot points you can bounce off without losing speed.</li><li>Apples let you place your own tongue swinging points anywhere.</li><li>Cacti launch tightropes you can use to cross big gaps.</li></ul><p>Since you can only hold one item at a time, Hop has a handy Backpack! As you play, you’ll discover new Veggies and unlock more Backpack Slots to store them. You can open the Backpack any time, and using it in a stressful moment will slow down time so you can plan your next moves.</p><p><strong>Collectibles</strong></p><p>Collectibles are a genre staple and there are lots in BIG HOPS! We’ve worked hard to give them all gameplay uses, so you never feel like you’re just checking off boxes</p><ul><li>Earn Dark Drips to help with Diss’ mysterious mission and unlock secrets.</li><li>Collect Dark Bits to earn gameplay modifying Trinkets for your backpack.</li><li>Buy Veggies and upgrade your Backpack, Wallet, and more at Drilson’s Depot.</li><li>Buy outfits, hats, and dyes to customize Hop’s look at Odette’s Outfitters.</li><li>Find and Identify real Bugs to fill your collection in Bugsy’s Conservatory.</li><li>Uncover Blueprints to build totally normal and not-at-all busted Gadgets.</li><li>Find <a title="Games > Mixtape [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mixtape">Mixtape</a>s to play on in-game on your Boombox or Hop-man.</li></ul><p>Equipping Trinkets means decorating your Backpack!</p><p><strong>Big Adventure</strong></p><p>Something we’re proud of is how many different areas there are in <em>Big Hops</em>. As you explore the four main Worlds (Forest, Desert, Ocean, and Mountain), expect a lot of surprising offshoots like the Boneyard, Bucko Cove, Hydro Plant, and Gulley Gang HQ. All these different places to explore really make it feel like you’re on a grand adventure!</p><p><strong>Inspirations</strong></p><p>I [Chris Wade] started <em>Big Hops</em> in 2019 (6 years ago!!!) with a single goal of modernizing the 3D platformer genre. The design trend at the time of giving players real freedom and creativity in games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, and <em>Rimworld</em> was so inspiring. Selfishly and jealously, I wanted to see emergent gameplay in my favorite genre.</p><p>Since then, <em>Big Hops</em> has become a maximalist game and taken on many more ideas and inspirations. Its mechanics, story, vibes, and humor draw on so many games and TV shows stretching back 40 years. <em>Mario</em> (<em>64</em>, <em>Odyssey</em>, <em>Sunshine</em>, and <em>Galaxy</em>) and <em>Zelda</em> (<em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Wind Waker</em>, and <em>Ocarina of Time</em>) have both been huge influences. We also spend a lot of time talking about <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, <em>Spelunky</em>, <em><a title="Series > Kingdom Hearts [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, <em>Psychonauts</em>, <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <em>Spongebob</em>, and <em>Steven Universe</em>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/big-hops-launches-january-12-2026-for-ps5-switch-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to <em>Beastro</em>! In this charming fusion of fantasy adventure, not all heroes wield swords… Some prefer the spoon. And, sometimes to save the world you’ve got to start with a really good meal.</p><p>Palo Pori is a beautiful and peaceful village of artisans and tastemakers. Beyond the village’s protective wall, darkness has begun to stir. Ravenous monsters have claimed the land and threaten to sink their teeth into this final morsel of hope and happiness.</p><p>Play as Panko, a young, talented chef, helping to run the local eatery. When Panko’s teacher goes missing, a mysterious visitor arrives with warnings of the dangers beyond the wall. It’s up to Panko to step up and take over the restaurant and tend to the ingredients and patrons. But that’s not all, Panko also finds himself serving the Caretakers, brave adventurers, sent to save the world. In this adventure, preserving peace starts in the kitchen!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>From Town to Table</strong></p><p>In Palo Pori, fresh is best! Gather ingredients and resources, care for animals and grow your own fruit and veg to build up your very own cozy town to table restaurant. Forage for wild herbs and unlock new seeds to grow to expand your meals.</p><p><strong>Serving Your Community</strong></p><p>Chop, flip, and sizzle your way through mouthwatering mini-games as you whip up delightful dishes for the townsfolk. Good food is always better with company, so work hard to improve your <a title="Genres > Cooking [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> and experiment with ingredients, to keep your patrons happy.</p><p>Tailor your restaurant to the tastes of your community, develop new meals, progress your know how through a skill tree and adjust the decor to increase your restaurant’s appeal.</p><p><strong>Feed the Caretakers</strong></p><p>You’ll also need to feed the hungry Caretakers; these brave denizens of the land will venture out into the wilds to fight the ravenous monsters threatening the peace of Palo Pori. Each Caretaker hails from their own flavour region, affecting their own tastes and preferences: some like it bitter, some like it sweet and some are just looking to fulfil their craving of the day! Craft thoughtful meals and balance the flavour profiles to boost their spirits, sharpen their skills, and unlock new abilities. Because let’s face it… Who can save the world on an empty stomach?</p><p><strong>Delicious Deck Building</strong></p><p>Now it’s time to put your meal to the test! This is where taste meets tactics. The dishes you serve will build your Caretaker’s deck – each ingredient unlocking a card. And once they’ve eaten, they’ll venture into the wilds to fight the monsters. Upon their return, they’ll recount their journey and play out their battles through a charming puppet theatre sequence. They might even bring you back some MONSTEROUS ingredients from their ventures. Fight the monsters in turn-based deck building combat, inspired by traditional trick-taking card games. Outplay the monsters, by matching their flavour magic or neutralising it with a balancing card. Add an enhancing card to power up your moves!

Over the course of 90-plus levels, Astro Bot makes brilliant use of the DualSense's adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, touch panel, gyro controls, and built-in speaker. From a mechanical perspective, Astro Bot is arguably the most inventive and playful 3D platformer ever made.</p><p>Astro Bot also doubles as a celebration of all things PlayStation. You'll meet little robots themed around other PlayStation heroes and heroines, including Ratchet, Rivet, Kratos, Atreus, Aloy, Nathan Drake, Sly Cooper, Jak, Crash Bandicoot, and many more. Some of the levels are even themed around different franchises and implement mechanics from those games.</p><p>Astro Bot earned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">9/10 in GameSpot's review</a> and won GOTY at last year's Game Awards.</p></div>                      </div><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D5SM3K4Q,B095T8C99C,B0F19GPDW3,B0C7WQRCPB,B08QFWWJ8K,B0BPMTJJ6D,B0CGXZQ4CD,B08XNRM6QN,B09SW6GCGL,B0CTVK7GBM,B0CJGPSXG4,B0CPYSPHR1,B0B3QWRQL8,B0CP4DCK45,B08FC5TTBF,B08QFPS48J,B09Z7JZW4P,B09RDRYF8L,B0CK4VWNYL,B0DX42RXMS,B0DD8TMP2Y,B0B61YDF5V,B09N848WMD,B08FC64CNF,B08JHQ4NBB,B0DWYP2PXP,B08QFZCGVJ,B098G34GBT,B08NX8F4W1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Holiday 2025 Game Deals</a></h2><p>PlayStation's Holiday Sale features a bunch of other notable game deals, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Astro+Bot+Game+Deal+Restocked+At+Amazon+-+Get+The+PS5+Platformer+For+Best+Price+Yet&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A34&amp;fnarticle_id=6536386&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-games%2Fratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-playstation-5-best-exclusive-game-deal-holiday-2025%2F1100-6536386%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> for $30, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Death Stranding 2</a> for $50, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Astro+Bot+Game+Deal+Restocked+At+Amazon+-+Get+The+PS5+Platformer+For+Best+Price+Yet&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+10%3A55%3A34&amp;fnarticle_id=6536386&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGod-of-War-Ragnar-k-Standard-Edition-Playstation-5-Physical%2F1336533270%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-playstation-5-best-exclusive-game-deal-holiday-2025%2F1100-6536386%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War: Ragnarok</a> for only $20, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> for $30.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now, Sandfall Interactive stands poised to make The Game Awards history. Last month, the studio broke The Game Awards' record for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-nominees-ranked-by-how-many-nominations-they-received/2900-7267/" data-ref-id="2900-7267">most award nominations</a>, earning a whopping 13, including Game of the Year. Earlier this year, I spoke with the studio's creative director, Guillaume Broche, who said the team was in "disbelief" about how the game has been received; it stands to reason that this sentiment has only grown with the game's tremendous success.</p><p dir="ltr">Broche also shared a bit of a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, explaining how there were "a lot of arguments" about the game's ending, why the team opted for minimal user interface, and how many people are still unaware of the game's biggest inspiration.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Firstly, I'd love to know: What is the atmosphere of the studio following the </strong><strong>game's tremendous success?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Broche: </strong>I think a lot of us are still in disbelief with how the game’s launched and how fans have embraced it. Every day we say to each other, "Is this real?" or, "Can you believe that?" when we see another milestone reached or that our favorite game developer or studio reached out and congratulated us. It's all really overwhelming in a way, and we’re super grateful for everyone for their faith and support.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>As I played through Expedition 33, it felt to me like the team took a "less is more" approach to creating the game. There are few UI elements on the screen and oftentimes, the character's expressions and what they don't say are just as impactful as what they do. That said, I'd like to hear in your own words about your design philosophies and principles, if you could elaborate on them.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We always wanted to tell a story that felt realistic and grounded. Of course, we have fantasy elements in the story, but at its core it’s a fundamentally human story. And in that story we wanted to have subtle, realistic interactions and emotions--which is why there’s a certain "less is more" feeling, like you say. It just makes the game feel more "real" in our eyes, or at least easier to engage with and relate to. Not every interaction in real life is a perfectly written, theatrical conversation--sometimes it’s just a look, or subtle moments of quietness, that have the most impact.</p><p dir="ltr">For the UI, we also wanted to have that same grounded approach to exploration. We trust the player to find their way through our levels, to understand our systems, and to engage with the world in the way we intended. We took some inspirations from games we grew up with in that sense, avoiding bloating our game with systems and designs that ultimately don’t improve the main game experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've found that Clair Obscur is phenomenal in working within shades of grey and every character feels deeply human. As such, reflecting on the game's ethics and big decisions are both interesting and challenging. Do you believe there truly is a true or "good" ending to the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That’s something we've had a lot of arguments about in the team too! I think your reaction to the endings, and which one is the "good" ending, is super subjective and related to your own personal experiences in real life. And I think that’s a strength of our writing and story--kudos to our Lead Writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, and our amazing mocap and voice actors for their performances--sometimes there is no clear "good" or "bad" choice in life that everyone will be happy with, and living within the grey, and those complex choices, are what makes us real people. Ultimately, what matters is your own interpretation of the ending and of the story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Many sites have been quick to note Legend of Dragoon, the Final Fantasy series, and even From Software titles as games that Clair Obscur has seemingly drawn inspiration from, but are there any other works that inspired you that you want to talk about?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Actually, I didn’t play Legend of Dragoon before coming up with the QTEs (quick-time events) during skills. I learnt later that a game did something similar! There are also other inspirations like the Persona series, but also action games like Devil May Cry and Nier.</p><p dir="ltr">One major inspiration is a French novel called La Horde du Contrevent. It tells the story of a group of explorers--or an expedition--travelling across the world to find the source of the supernatural wind that sweeps across the world. Their tale, and the human stories of the team and their discoveries as they travel the world, were also an inspiration for us as we developed a story of our own expeditioners traveling across the world. I’d recommend that anyone who’s a fan of our story picks up this book, but I don’t think it’s been translated into English fully since it’s so densely written with so much nuance in the French language. So I guess maybe fans should learn French, and then read the novel!</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Whether Clair Obscur will break the record currently held by The Last of Us: Part II and take home more than seven awards from The Game Awards remains to be seen. However, with 13 nominations and a Game of the Year award on the line, it's certainly worth tuning in to see what happens. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-game-awards/" data-ref-id="5000-616839">The Game Awards</a> airs tomorrow, December 11, at 9:30 PM ET / 6:30 PM PT.</p>

            <p>The Game Awards may be one of the biggest events of the year, but I have just as much excitement from the indie event that precedes it, Day of the Devs. Seeing such innovative games from a wide range of indie developers makes me optimistic about the future of the industry, and this year was no exception. If you missed the latest showcase, here's a recap of every game shown in order of appearance.</p>
