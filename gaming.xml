		<p>Ah, Monster Hunter. It’s everybody’s favourite game series about hunting monsters, and then chopping off the useful bits to turn into even sharper and hardier stuff to hunt some more monsters. It’s a loop that’s been working for two decades, and we’re still not tired of it, or the spectacular menagerie of toothy antagonists. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/07/monster-hunter-stories-review/">Monster Hunter Stories</a> certainly has elements of the mainline series, but it’s safe to say that it’s a slightly different proposition.</p>
<p>Originally a tentpole 3DS title, back when Capcom was certain that the 3DS was the perfect home for the Monster Hunter series, Stories takes the beloved franchise and turns it into a turn-based JRPG, with bright, colourful graphics, and equally bright and colourful characters. As the Monster Hunter series has grown increasingly important to the company, it’s little surprise to find both Monster Hunter Stories and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/07/monster-hunter-stories-2-switch-review-pc-wings-of-ruin/">its sequel</a> finally being ported to the PlayStation, while the first game also arrives on PC and Nintendo Switch for the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PC, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5rgFruN1bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Stories was, and is, a welcoming and easy-going introduction to the world of Monster Hunter. Instead of slaying the iconic beasts, here you’re more focused on forming a bond of friendship, riding them around the landscape and then utilising their special moves in turn-based combat. It’s like a How to Train Your Dragon RPG, but with more teeth.</p>
<p>There’s three different kind of attack: Power, Speed, and Technical. Much like Fire Emblem’s fabled weapon triangle, each type of move is stronger against one of the others, and choosing the correct type is the key to a successful battle. Each time you make a successful attack, you also build up your meter, allowing you to ‘Ride-On’ and hop on your Monstie, before unleashing a hugely powerful attack.</p>


<p>Successfully winning a battle will see a cavalcade of parts and bits shorn from that monster, and it’s here that the classic Monster Hunter loop comes into play, with parts accrued from battle then being crafted into new equipment to head back into battle with.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Stories certainly looks better than it ever has, with both its previous 3DS and mobile outings utterly trounced by the capability of the PS4, let alone the PS5. However, there are some clear signs that this is a fairly straightforward remaster, with some suspiciously low-res textures here and there, and a frame rate that somehow doesn’t feel as smooth as it should.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Stories 2 is a match for the PC release, which in turn thoroughly trounced the somewhat disappointing performance of the Nintendo Switch version. It’s smoother, more modern, and expands the story and world in a meaningful way – where the original game feels a little outdated at times, that’s never the case with its sequel.</p>
<p>The great thing about Monster Hunter Stories is the way it opens up the world of Monster Hunter to a different demographic, and younger gamers will find a lot to love in its primary coloured take on the creature-centric series. If they’re wrapped up in it all, there’s also the accompanying anime which follows the storyline of the first game, and expands on some of the ideas and characters in a more well-rounded way.</p>

<p>Given how popular Monster Hunter has become it’s gratifying that fans of the series can now experience these enjoyable outings wherever they game – well, unless you’re an Xbox gamer. Where the original game is showing its age, both games weave a tale that’s well worth diving into, especially while fans wait for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

If you have been waiting patiently for the PlayStation 5 release date for vampiric survival game V Rising, I have some fang-tastic news for you to sink your teeth into. 
</p>
<p>
Developer Stunlock Studios announced V Rising will make its way to Sony's console next month, on 11th June. That being said (and as is becoming increasingly common these days), if you choose to pre-order one of the game's bundles, you will be able to get five days of early access.
</p>
<p>
But before I get into all that, you can check out V Rising's PS5 trailer below. 
</p>
<figure>

<p>
On its PlayStation debut, V Rising will give a fresh wave of players the chance to embody a newly-awakened vampire, before setting about constructing an appropriately gothic not-so-humble-abode to live in. Oh, and there are of course bosses that need to be slain. 57 of them, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
The PS5 version of V Rising will have DualSense controller support, as well as a number of UI improvements. As for the editions and bundles, there is the standard edition of V Rising, which is retailing for £32.99 on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-0000000000000001">PlayStation Store</a>. This version gives you the base game.
</p>
<p>
Then, there is the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-CASTLEVANIABUNDL">V Rising Legacy of Castlevania Edition</a>, which will set you back £49.99. As you may have surmised, this edition comes with the base game as well as Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack. It will also give you five days of early access.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, there is the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0775-PPSA16262_00-VRCOMPLETEBUNDLE">V Rising Complete Edition</a>, costing £79.99. This edition includes both the base game and the Legacy of Castlevania Premium Pack, but also adds the following three packs into the mix: Sinister Evolution Pack, Dracula's Relics Pack and Eldest Bloodline Pack. As with the Legacy of Castlevania Edition, this chap will also provide those who pre-order with five days of early access. 
</p>
<p>
If you are a PlayStation Plus member, you will get a 10 percent pre-order discount on all editions of V Rising.

Following two years in early access on PC, V Rising released in full earlier this month. Soon after, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/v-rising-hits-100000-concurrent-players-on-steam">breached 100,000 concurrent players on Steam for the first time</a> since it was released as an early access back in 2022.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-the-ps4-remaster.876186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-stories-preview-exploring-ps4-remaster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> has had an interesting journey over the years. Having begun its life as a Nintendo 3DS title and later smartphone platforms, <em>Stories </em>marked a shift in priorities for the series by going all in on a more traditional JRPG aesthetic.&nbsp; Whilst other entries focused more on action such as the fairly recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-rise-review"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a>, <em>Stories</em> instead settles back on a turn-based battle system and monster collecting.</p>

<p>Now eight years later, Capcom is keen on reviving <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> for some more modern platforms – specifically, PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4. We had a chance to check out the HD port in an early preview and go hands-on with some early parts of the game.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Stories </em>opens up as one might expect from any RPG – a fancy cutscene sets the mood, there’s some character and monster introduction, and a glimpse of the colorful world to eventually explore. There’s then a shift to the real-time graphics and my first impression is that everything is very colorful and eye-catching.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=pvHTp4eG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518212840.jpg?itok=HrHjUWAz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
For a remaster, Capcom has done well to keep everything bright and cheery, despite the obvious limitations brought about by 3DS game design. This is immediately evident upon controlling a character – areas aren’t very big and tend to guide you down a linear path toward a marked objective. Not that there’s anything wrong with that – in fact I did appreciate that the game was telling me where to go.</p>

<p>After a short introduction, your character meets up with two characters known as Cheval and Lilia, who are searching for an egg. From here, you’re tasked with customizing your player avatar of sorts, and that includes selecting their gender as well as a limited number of hair, eye, skin color, and even voice options. You can even name them, if you’d like, or select a generated name to continue along the story.</p>

<p>The egg the group finds turns out to be a young Rathalos – named Ratha of course – who decides your character is their parent. Things seem well and good until you go back to the village of Hakum and a tragedy takes place killing others, including your new monster friend.</p>

<p>There’s a time skip and it’s from here that<em> Monster Hunter Stories</em> really gets going. With the threat of a sickness known as the Black Blight still around, you’ll be taking up a Kinship rite and a crystal in order to collect monsters and become what is known as a Rider.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=YVjHWvT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518213841.jpg?itok=9AG1Ac4e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
With the monster hunting and capturing element now in play and a key element of the game, the player character leaves the village, encounters new characters, and ventures further into the mystery of the Blight corrupting the land.</p>

<p>While the narrative is front and center, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does eventually get you to the battle and other systems after some lengthy exposition. Hoisting up the traditional JRPG mantle means the main system is turn-based, or each party member and enemy take turns attacking after abilities are selected from a menu without a time limit.</p>

<p>Your created character has a bit of flexibility when it comes to their turn as attacks are divided into three types: Power, Technical, and Speed. Each of these types of attacks comes with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, use a Speed attack if an enemy is striking at you with a Power ability.</p>

<p>A cut-in scene known as a Head-to-Head when the enemy is targeting the attacking character. The attack type that is stronger in these situations will win out, or if they’re the same, you will end the turn in a draw. The other examples of attack strengths include Power being stronger than Technical, and Technical over Speed. It’s important to keep these elements of sorts in mind during battle so you can chase those bonuses.</p>

<p>Battles can also be mixed up with a number of weapon types such as a great sword, or a hammer. There are also different skills and, of course, the monster collecting aspect to consider in customization.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=ff2W7JY0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories_20240518222521.jpg?itok=G4sYmoJK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
Beyond the single-player aspect, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> lets you play around in multiplayer matches online, so there’s a lot to play around with here for anyone looking to get their turn-based itch.</p>

<p>Circling back around to the visual side of things, it’s important to remember that yes, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is a remaster of a game that was originally developed for a handheld system. It’s because of that that the models are rather simplistic, even for an anime cel-shaded style.</p>

<p>There’s also not a lot of environmental detail or animations going on. Most of the dialogue scenes are in a sort of visual novel side-by-side style, although there are some traditional cutscenes and multiple CG cutscenes included. All of these have been upconverted from their original resolution to fit an HD output, although the CG scenes haven't been redone to compensate for more pixels.</p>

<p>Otherwise, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> is voiced in both English and Japanese, or if you want you can choose the original version’s voice track. I was even surprised the player character does have some canned lines and isn’t completely a silent protagonist. Despite other limitations, this does add a lot to the overall presentation.</p>

<p>Despite its origins on Nintendo 3DS, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> does at least deserve its time in the sun. With its sequel out now on Nintendo Switch and PC, this remaster release looks to provide fans or even newcomers with a chance to experience the <em>Stories</em> series all on the same platforms. And for PS4 players, it’s just the beginning with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-stories-2-review">sequel</a> dropping simultaneously on June 14, 2024.</p>

<p id="uXTcnn">D&amp;D’s multiverse is extremely vast and complicated, and <em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> seems to fill a much-needed gap to help both newcomers and long-time players make sense of its fantastical realms. Featuring artwork pulled from 50 years of sourcebooks and adventures, each chapter of this illustrated guide takes a close look at one of the many worlds, planes, and settings in the D&amp;D multiverse — from the beloved plane of Mystara, to the perilous Shadowfell, to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23308644/dnd-spelljammer-review-losers">Spelljammer</a>’s boundless Astral Sea. </p>
<p id="afzuL8">But this is no dry, matter-of-fact history book. Instead, readers will explore these settings through the narration of the archmage Mordenkainen, who shares his personal experiences of these locations and thoughts on the legendary characters who’ve lived there. Readers will dive deep into Mordenkainen’s beloved home of Greyhawk (the default setting for the soon to be released 2024 revision of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067481/dnd-dungeons-dragons-onednd-delay-2024-rules-refresh-players-handbook-dmg-release-date-price"><em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em></a>), and learn how his belief in the Balance influences his run-ins with creatures across the multiverse.</p>
<p id="hVSw1b"><em>Worlds &amp; Realms</em> also features original stories by Jasmine Bhullar, Geoffrey Golden, Jody Houser and Eric Campbell, and Jaleigh Johnson.</p>
<p id="hpywYG">Polygon has an exclusive first look inside <em>Worlds &amp; Realms </em>below, revealing 22 of the book’s 368 pages.

<p id="VhYWI8"><strong>Adam Lee: </strong>There’s a place within my mind that is reserved for childhood memories, which are of a different quality than other memories. This image lives within that space. I remember looking at it with my little kid imagination, each detail providing stories in my mind.</p>
<p id="5cjwbr">Even before I knew how to play D&amp;D or even what it was, I was making stories just looking at the art on the box. Erol Otus’ art is so mythic and perfect for capturing the vibe of D&amp;D in the 80’s.</p>

<p id="cQ2rBq">I want to say that it took a lot of time, staring at the blank page in artistic agony, crumpling page after page, before the first words came for the introduction.</p>
<p id="DIq6xj">But I became (my version) of Mordenkainen fairly quickly and his voice and his intentions were apparent. I had spent some time thinking about the world from his perspective while working on D&amp;D, so I wasn’t working from zero, but he flowed onto the page and there were times I had to write fast to keep up.</p>
<p id="9ANxqB">As always, amazing art inspires the imagination. When I first saw this piece come in after being commissioned, I felt like it revealed another dimension of the master mage.</p>

<p id="oHaeRN">One of the things about writing from the perspective of an archmage is to find out what actually strikes them as important. What do they notice? When their world is so fantastical, what compels them to look deeper?</p>
<p id="1bF2RT">Here’s a person who wields the power of magic, who has traveled across the multiverse, who has fought interdimensional monsters, and has dined with angelic beings. Why not leave humanity behind for all the splendor of a host of extreme and otherworldly experiences?</p>
<p id="wAdTNH">I wanted to shine a light on the value of humanity through the eyes of Mordenkainen. For some reason, he didn’t join the heavenly host, nor did he become a demigod, or a tyrant on some high mountain peak. He became a protector of the multiverse.</p>
<p id="CKpQ89">I think there’s something about humanity that he’s immensely curious about. There’s something sacred within each being. A mystery beyond mere magic.</p>

<p id="oCeCvH">To get a chance to write about Greyhawk from the point of view of Mordenkainen was an experience that (at times) was not unlike this illustration. But that’s the adventure of life. I never know what is going to come out of the forest.</p>

<p id="qvqdIr">Figuring out how to write this book — a combination of lore and story — was something that I thought about a lot.</p>
<p id="oVXWHT">I wanted to talk about the worlds and share the existing lore, but I also wanted to bring something new to it, something never before revealed so that no matter what your experience was with D&amp;D, you were going to find out new and interesting stuff.</p>
<p id="02QM3g">Writing from the point of view of Mordenkainen allowed me to stretch outside of canon lore to allow for a bit of wizardly speculation which I found to be exciting — I was on an adventure with Mordenkainen as he investigated his own mind and the mysteries of the multiverse.</p>

<p id="dvPC6p">Long before I worked on D&amp;D as a professional, I was a player and a fan of these worlds, and I had my own opinions about them.</p>
<p id="nAvO4R">While working on D&amp;D, I had a chance to dive into many of the worlds at varying depths, but usually from a very agnostic point of view — we set the stage of the adventure and described the world for the Dungeon Master to interpret as they will. The players would experience the story and then form their own opinions.</p>
<p id="v4enMj">When I played the character of Mordenkainen for this book, I got to write from his POV. After a while, I began to have different opinions of the worlds as seen through his eyes. The most surprising reaction to any of these worlds was his reaction to Krynn.</p>
<p id="fDWeEB">I must say, I learned a lot from seeing Krynn through his eyes.</p>

<p id="NwlU1W">When writing anything for D&amp;D, I am always thinking about a DM getting a great idea for a one shot or a character for their campaign. I’m always in “modular mode” where I know that any chunk of what I am writing can be taken out and put into someone’s game.</p>
<p id="PJGxcD">I wish when I go into the great beyond that I can sit in front of a cosmic TV and watch how many snippets of my silly writing made it into games or made people smile or laugh. Hopefully, I’d be watching for a long time. That would bring me great joy.</p>

<p id="49Zvs3">Revisiting Ravenloft for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22745128/dungeons-dragons-best-campaign-curse-of-strahd-horror-beginners"><em>Curse of Strahd</em></a> was one of my favorite times working on D&amp;D. We dealt with so many questions about the nature of evil, the story of Strahd, and the metaphysics of Barovia.</p>
<p id="Enczzh">It was, ironically, great fun to live in Barovia, walk with the people, explore the domain, and write a few locations that were certain to be disturbing.</p>

<p id="jYpYCY">Every version of D&amp;D has its take on the legendary monsters and villains of D&amp;D. For <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/9/2/9242155/out-of-the-abyss-into-the-underdark"><em>Out of the Abyss</em></a> we got the treat of revisiting all the superstar demon lords and do the 5th edition version of them to continue that creative legacy.</p>
<p id="V5NFv5">For me, D&amp;D is as much a visual experience as it is a written one, and the images from the game’s earliest of days to now have an iconic stature in my mind and are forever imprinted in my memory.</p>

<p id="4PkZBK">Throughout Mordenkainen’s journey, the Balance is what keeps him grounded, and potentially keeps him sane, as he explores the multiverse, encountering all manner of fantastical beings and bizarre entities.</p>
<p id="GFnkYp">The multiverse is a bewildering place, and without a purpose, it can become as confusing as a hall of mirrors. But through it all, Mordenkainen follows the beacon of the Balance like the string that allowed Theseus to navigate the labyrinth, slay the Minotaur, and emerge alive and victorious. </p>

The 11-minute video is mostly just gameplay of the mods in action, which turns the player into a full-blown Mandalorian, complete with jetpack and badass armor. A climactic action sequence shows the player fighting against Imperial soldiers and even an AT-ST, a large mechanical war machine on two legs. The most impressive part of the overhaul is just how extensive it is: Walking through the game world completely transports the player to a galaxy far far away, with NPCs now Imperial officers and rebels who are populating areas emblazoned with factions’ insignia from the franchise, and signs written in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/three-months-of-prep-made-our-star-wars-galaxys-edge-t-1838364921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/three-months-of-prep-made-our-star-wars-galaxys-edge-t-1838364921">Aurebesh</a></span>, <em>Star Wars</em>’ in-universe language, added throughout.

They stress that (as with any modding process) the load order is crucial to get right, and you can follow along in the video to help avoid any issues.</p><p>DeityVengy points out that all the mods shown in their list aren’t actually turned on for the gameplay shown during the video, as some more experimental mods break things and prevent you from having a smooth gameplay experience. The overhaul mostly relies on pre-existing mods like <em>Star Wars</em> Replacer, with DeityVengy creating a custom HUD for the experience including weapon icons accurate to the modded guns. The full list of mods and the custom files are all linked in the video for players eager to try it out for themselves.

The memo reads as follows:</p><p>“Tesla is updating the gaming computer in your Model X and your vehicle is no longer capable of playing Steam games. All other entertainment and app functionalities are unaffected.”</p><p>While saying “you can play video games in your car” is the kind of “we’re living in the future” nonsense big tech corporations want to tout when they’re trying to sell you something, I can’t get past that cars are death traps that do not need a million bells and whistles, when safety and ease of use are still so demonstrably short of where they should be.</p><p>Tesla’s Steam app doesn’t let you play games while the car is in motion, which was at least a bare minimum safety measure in this situation. But it also makes me wonder what was the imagined use case of this. I could see someone making the argument that maybe kids want to play games while their parents drive them somewhere, but if the app only works in park, it just seems like the most inconvenient way to play your games. If you can afford a Tesla, get yourself a Steam Deck.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It was a couple of days ago that Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, narrowed down the release window for Grand Theft Auto 6. Instead of ‘2025’, we’re now looking at a ‘Fall 2025’ launch window. In a follow-up statement, Zelnick met the community on transparent ground and acknowledged that delays can happen, but the reason the company pushed out the Fall 2025 window is because they are ‘highly confident in that timing’. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-have-faith">Have Faith</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in Fall 2025, and Take-Two is highly confident it’ll hit that timeframe. It’s not expected that there will be any delays, especially considering GTA 6 has likely been in development for the better part of a decade, but never say never.</p>



<p>Since being revealed by Rockstar Games in December 2023, GTA 6 has dominated newsfeeds worldwide. Every tidbit of information generates more hype, with the most recent topic of discussion being the matter of who is voicing the protagonist(s). There continues to be an immense sense of anticipation around GTA 6, and that won’t dissipate until it’s in the hands of gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the full interview with CNBC, in which Zelnick makes his comments about the launch window:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>There are expectations that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be ‘the most important release’ in entertainment history. It’ll likely be the fastest-selling game ever made, and it’s easy to see the open-world epic pulling north of $1 billion in a single day.</p>

<p>A new claim regarding Black Myth: Wukong is giving some new insight into what players could expect to experience when it launches in August. This comes from leaker Lunatic Ignus <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">on Tw</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1792541397192528213">tter</a>.</p>



<p>According to Ignus, Black Myth: Wukong features “around 160 enemy types” and “80+ bosses”. They go on to say that the game will have New Game+ at launch as well as multiple endings to experience. </p>



<p>“The game is slightly easier than soulsborne games,” they added.</p>



<p>As always, take the latest claims with a grain of salt until it’s either confirmed by the developer or independently verified by Insider Gaming.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong releases August 20 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It’s latest trailer was on Sunday, giving players a new look at the game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GameSpot parent company Fandom has released its fourth annual Inside Gaming report, and one of the key takeaways is that personal expression within games is increasingly important to players. The Inside Gaming report is based on data from Fandom's 350 million monthly unique visitors, 45 million pages of content, and 250,000 wikis.</p><p dir="ltr">The report found that the main reason people play games is to unwind and relieve stress (54%), but a close second was "creation, imagination, and self-expression" (46%). This is up 10% from 2023, demonstrating a growing trend. Within games, the top five in-game customization players seek out to express themselves include character personalization (76%), Gamertags and usernames (48%), communication (35%), signatures and emblems (31%), and emotions and gestures (30%).</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876" data-ratio="0.81330868761553" data-width="1082" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304876"></a><figcaption>Why do you play games?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304876-screenshot2024-05-17at3.22.15pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The report also found that there is a significant gap between how people express themselves in real life versus online. 80% of respondents said their "gamer personality" is different than their real-life personality. And then 64% said it's easier to be themselves online rather than in person.</p><p dir="ltr">The Inside Gaming report went on to say that 60% of people believe self-expression in gaming is more important than ever before, with the study specifically calling out titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox for offering extensive options to personalize their characters. Anyone who has played those games knows very well the depth and scope of what kinds of items, skins, and other in-game wares players can acquire to deck their character out as they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the report touched on how 64% of respondents said gaming communities represent "vital safe spaces" where they feel free to express themselves, unlike how they might be able to in real life.</p><p dir="ltr">"From character customization to cosplay and content creation, video games have empowered gamers to explore, express and enhance their identity--nearly two thirds of gamers claim it’s easier to be themselves with a controller in their hands," Fandom CMO Stephanie Fried said. "With the growing significance of gaming as a means for self-expression and personal evolution, it's crucial for brands to connect to these motivators to help players bring their gaming personas to life in the real world."</p><p dir="ltr">For more, <a href="https://about.fandom.com/press#_ga=2.10852339.69101175.1716216011-135910388.1674143870" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">check out the full study</a>.</p>

You can now download or watch the latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast, offering you a quick dive into the biggest stories  from the past week.
</p>
<p>
This week, we discuss the news from Sony regarding retired CEO Jim Ryan's replacement. Or rather, replacements. Plural. We reflect on the benefits of having long-serving execs like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-names-hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-as-its-new-ceos">Herman Hulst and Hideaki Nishino in charge of PlayStation</a>, as well as the challenges they face and the platform holder's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-focus-on-engagement-time-over-units-sold-makes-sense-for-playstation-opinion">increased focus on player engagement over units sold</a>.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss the Stop Killing Games campaign, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-government-responds-to-stop-killing-games-campaign">the UK government's response to it</a>, and the wider shift we see in both the games industry and entertainment in general that is reflected by the rise of such a campaign. Brendan dives even deeper into this issue in the latest <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/disgraceful-degradation-this-week-in-business">This Week In Business</a>.

 <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">Now, I’m wondering whether the concept of irradiated birds that are invisible, indestructible, and silent is actually more of an issue than them just not being in the game at all.

This means you can wander the wastelands of Boston City assuredly confident that birds do not, in fact, exist.*</p>

            <p>
Free-to-play platform fighter MultiVersus has confirmed the inclusion of Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th and Agent Smith from The Matrix, ahead of the game going live (again) next week, on 28th May.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros' take on Super Smash Bros originally launched in early access last summer, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">offline for the past 11 months</a> while it was upgraded to Unreal Engine 5. 
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus will arrive next week compatible with cross-platform and cross-progression play for PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. (No Nintendo support is a surprise, but at this point, it's probably best just to wait for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.)

<p>
27 unique <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">characters are playable in MultiVersus</a>, taking from a rollcall of Warner Bros-owned franchises (and characters not already snapped up by Fortnite). 
</p>
<p>
The roster includes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Joker from DC Comics, Finn and Jake from Adventure Time, Gizmo and Stripe from Gremlins, Bugs Bunny, Marvin the Martian and Taz from Looney Tunes, LeBron James from Space Jam, Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, Shaggy and Velma from Scooby-Doo (but not actually Scooby-Doo himself), Rick and Morty from Rick and Morty, the Iron Giant from The Iron Giant, plus Tom and Jerry. 
</p>
<p>
As for the game's newest arrivals, Jason Voorhees will be available at launch, when Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy begins. Agent Smith will then debut later in the season.
</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-wants-always-on-game-success-for-dc-game-of-thrones">Warner Bros said it wanted "always on success" for its biggest franchises</a>, four of which (DC, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat) are valued at worth a billion dollars each. Live service games such as MultiVersus are designed to provide just this, with Warner Bros saying it wanted to make "sure we get as much engagement and time with fans as possible".</p>

<p>On April 18, Warhorse Studios lifted the lid on Kingdom Come: Deliverance II in the most epic way possible. With a stunning reveal trailer and a lengthy showcase that was equal parts explorative and regal, ‘KCDII’ was uncovered in full, filling fans worldwide with an immense sense of anticipation and excitement. It’s the direct follow-up to 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it has been in development for quite a while.</p>



<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of catching up with and interviewing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisistommckay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom McKay</a>, the instantly recognisable actor and white-hot talent behind Henry of Skalitz, the lead in both Kingdom Come: Deliverance and the sequel, which is due to be released later this year. </p>



<p>This is what I’ve dubbed ‘Becoming Henry’.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-road-to-kingdom-come">On The Road To Kingdom Come</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a stunning open-world game that’s rooted in realism. There is attention to detail in everything, from the period-accurate combat mechanics to the survival elements that make the game challenging. It’s even set in a real-world location that was painstakingly researched by what was once a very small team – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/warhorsestudios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warhorse Studios</a>. </p>



<p>I’ve come to learn that the studio has expanded massively since the first game, and it’s now backed by PLAION. In my chat with Tom McKay, I was eager to rewind and learn how he came across the role in the first place, given that Kingdom Come: Deliverance was the first (and still the only) game franchise McKay has worked on.</p>



<p><strong>McKay:</strong> ‘<em>It comes through the same channels as most of your acting work, and more and more in a way that I think is good and exciting, the worlds are kind of blending. Historically, they were very separate beasts, and a lot of TV, film, and theatre actors wouldn’t necessarily move between gaming and vice versa, but that’s happening more and more and there are lots of brilliant, big names doing it. </em></p>



<p><em>It was very much the same way that I would audition for any other job, and then I went out to Prague in like 2016 to meet everybody and do essentially a final audition, and that was it. Then they offered me the job. I don’t think anybody at that point, certainly not me, thought we’d be having this conversation eight years later – but the second game is so anticipated and I think that is absolutely brilliant.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m biased, but I’m seeing a lot of the work that the guys have done at Warhorse and it is completely mindblowing. It’s not just the kind of next level from the last game, it’s like fifty levels up from there, I think.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-the-transition">The Transition</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I was interested to learn about the ‘switch’ between Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. It’s a different world to the one that existed several years ago when the first game was being pieced together, and that’s something that McKay confirmed as he broke down the intricacies of playing Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The biggest technical difference was the facial capture. We didn’t do live facial capture for the motion capture the first time around, and this time we did. We had big head cams, which make you look like stag beetles, which are technically challenging in a way – intimate scenes and fight scenes are more challenging because you can’t get that close to each other.&nbsp;In terms of suits and the studio – we were in a different studio but it felt very similar.</em></p>



<p><em>In terms of extracurricular training, there isn’t a tonne. Most of us have done a basic level to get us to a good enough level, but when it becomes stunts, <strong>it becomes stunts</strong>, like it would on any other production. In terms of weaponry, we’ve got loads of photos and we’ll show them at various points, but the actual weapons are just hilarious, like polystyrene. That’s how they’re supposed to look, that’s how they look in every other motion capture studio, but they don’t look like the kind of beautiful, ornate, intimidating weapons you’ll see.</em>‘</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that the voice acting portion of the production had wrapped up after a whopping 500 hours of studio time. Not being familiar with how that worked from an acting perspective, I engaged McKay with a question about the process:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘The first chapter of our involvement is the motion capture. We finished about two years ago, and on this occasion, it was two big chunks of roughly about six or seven weeks each. Those were separated by a period of maybe about four or five months. That was very much the kind of first brick in the wall from the acting perspective. From a developmental perspective, there’s a huge amount of work and a huge amount of people heavily involved well before any of us actors turn up. That was the same for the first time, it was even more so the case for this game because it’s much bigger. We’re relatively late to the party in that respect.</em></p>



<p><em>The guys at Warhorse were very considerate about everything, but particularly about sort of ‘vocal stamina’ because there were so many lines for Henry. Anything the player can say in any iteration of the game has to be recorded, which is why it’s such a huge volume of material. I had to do eight-hour sessions, whereas most actors would do four-hour sessions because it’s more manageable vocally, but in terms of just getting through it, we realised that the only way we’d hit the targets and the deadlines was to just do eight-hour days. We started with the more vocally smooth stuff and then if there was any intense barking or anything like that, that was at the end of the day. And actually, the last day was about an hour of just absolute full-on screaming and yelling.’</em></p>



<p>Naturally, McKay couldn’t reveal any details about the game, but he did mention that the core ‘feel’ of the product is relatively the same as the first title:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘I’m not going to speak too much about that because I’m not sure how much I’m allowed to say. I’m very much understood from all the feedback that the realistic element was key and a big part of its USP and it’s what made it harder but my understanding is that it’s what made it really enjoyable. My understanding is that the very realistic element, the immersive element, is still very much the heart of this game.</em>‘</p>



<h2 id="h-deliverance">Deliverance</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is reportedly ‘at least twice the size’ of the first game, both in terms of the map space available and the overall scope of the project. It’s an ambitious undertaking that is much more technically advanced than the first game, which was made evident by the stunning trailer that Warhorse Studios showcased little more than a month ago. </p>



<p>McKay confirmed he’d never played the first game as he ‘isn’t a massive gamer’, but he pledged to give Kingdom Come: Deliverance II a shot:</p>



<p><strong>McKay: </strong><em>‘Most of the staff I know very well on a personal level now, we’ve become very good friends, because you would never work with a team like this for that length of time at those close quarters in any other game. I see more consistently just by being in the office what’s being executed day in, and day out, and it’s absolutely mindblowing. Yeah, I will definitely be playing this game. In terms of my technical ability to play it well, that’s another matter.’</em></p>



<p>It isn’t yet known when Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released, but we’ve been given a window of 2024 – so within a few months, we’ll be back and in control of Henry of Skalitz, continuing the vast adventure that was kicked off way back in 2018.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 13 Combat Tips For Baldur’s Gate 3</p>
      </div>
<p>The new team in Warsaw joins Larian's existing studios in Ghent, Barcelona, Dublin, Guildford, Quebec, and Kuala Lumpur. There are <a href="https://larian.com/careers/location/warsaw?location=warsaw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">numerous open positions available at the Warsaw office</a> across a variety of disciplines.</p><p>The announcement of Larian Studios Warsaw comes just days after Activision announced the opening of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-announces-new-studio-making-all-new-franchise/1100-6523503/" data-ref-id="1100-6523503">new studio Elsewhere Entertainment, which is also based in Warsaw.</a> Other gaming companies with offices in Warsaw include CD Projekt and 11 Bit.</p><p>Larian has not announced its next game, but it will not be another Dungeons &amp; Dragons title. Larian is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">moving beyond the fantasy series and creating something new</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">Hasbro has said it intends to do more with Baldur's Gate in the gaming landscape.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not what we were made for," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian boss Swen Vincke said about making Baldur's Gate 4</a>. "That's literally the opposite of what Larian is about. We want to do big, new things. We don't want to rehash the thing that we've done already."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">Speaking to GameSpot</a>, Vincke explained that Larian's next game won't actually be the company's super-ambitious "very big RPG," but will be a step toward realizing it.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there is some tech that we don't have yet," Vincke said. "And I don't know what the specs are on the next-gen [of gaming systems] yet, but I hope that it's going to bring us closer."</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Immersive sims are an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/weekly-kusoge-die-hard-nes-immersive-sim-retro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">odd and exceedingly specific niche</a> that some players just don’t feel like dealing with, <em>but</em> those who enjoy them play all of them. If you’re a fan, too, then you’ll be thrilled to hear that <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s next major update is coming very, very soon. Kind of!</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">More specifically, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-is-a-fun-blend-of-survival-horror-and-immersive-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gloomwood</em> is an Early Access ImSim</a> that’s going through a slow and meticulous production process headed by the developer Dillon Rogers. The game’s next major update, titled ‘The Underport’ had been slated for mid-2024 for some time at this point, but plans have now changed, and the chunk of content featured in it was so substantial that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/6009568738059053793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it had to be sliced in half</a>. The Underport is now, therefore, <em>two</em> updates instead of one, and its first half, titled ‘The Power Station’ is coming later this month.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dillon Rogers</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-gloomwood-s-power-station-level-is-coming-this-month-the-hive-is-on-the-horizon" data-injectable="false">Gloomwood’s Power Station level is coming this month, The Hive is on the horizon</h2> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><em>Gloomwood</em> first launched via Steam Early Access in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gloomwood-early-access-august-16-trailer-pc-new-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 2022</a>, and the game has been iterating upon its immersive sim core ever since. While the fact that the Underport has bifurcated into two separate releases is a bit sad, the flip side of the equation is that we’ll soon have a sizeable new chunk of <em>Gloomwood</em> goodness to tide us over. A fair trade, I’d say.</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">At this time, we don’t know when the second half of the Underport, now known as ‘The Hive’ might be coming out. Presumably, it’s still slated for 2024, but we’ll need to wait and see what Rogers has to say on that front.</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">The bit that we do know for a fact, though, is that <em>Gloomwood</em> still has a fairly long and storied road ahead of it. As per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1150760/view/4182228661134367002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous bit of news about the Underdark update</a>, Rogers intends to focus on the aptly titled Research Update after all of its content comes out: “[Research] will allow the doctor to take body parts from enemies back to the lab at the lighthouse in order to study them and gain new abilities.” Fun!</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">After the Research Update, Rogers explained his team will be working on the ‘Bank’ level, which is due to introduce a high-tech section of the city, which is a wholly different brand of excitement, all things considered.</p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="false">So, it’s slow going, but <em>Gloomwood</em>‘s been nothing short of great so far, and ImSim fans are used to waiting anyway. Especially now, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio behind the legendary <em>Prey</em></a> sadly about to close down. For those who’d like to play <em>Gloomwood</em> in its 1.0 form, all I can say is – stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-is-the-perfect-place-for-a-modern-take-on-assassins-creed-assassins-vs-templars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-is-the-perfect-place-for-a-modern-take-on-assassins-creed-assassins-vs-templars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="358" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In Ubisoft’s <em>XDefiant</em>, factions from across the publisher’s various video game franchises battle it out for supremacy using equipment and abilities unique to them based on the way they behave in their respective properties. But I’ve noticed a shocking lack of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> factions, and I think they’d work incredibly well. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Since the original <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the Assassins/Hidden Ones and Templars/The Order of the Ancients have been battling it out for control over Pieces of Eden and, in the greater scheme of things, the world. While the sci-fi elements of these Pieces of Eden give someone the power to influence the world, these factions have been fighting on a much more grounded level for centuries. </p> <figure data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">Each game sees those who are part of or who work with both factions use weapons from the current time period to head into battle against one another or strike on a much more personal level. Even the iconic Hidden Blades are melee weapons that are ever so slightly altered over time to provide an advantage for that period or the protagonist wielding them. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">The one aspect that many other fans and I think we don’t see enough of in the series is the modern-day Assassins and Templars going head-to-head. There are scenes where Templars are allegedly storming a building, or Assassins are coming to help, but we don’t often see the weapons they use or their tactics. <em>XDefiant</em> could change this. </p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-all-factions-and-their-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faction in <em>XDefiant</em></a> exists in roughly the same time period. For example, <em>The Division</em>‘s Cleaners and <em>Far Cry 6</em>‘s Libertad are arguably on the low-tech end of the scale, while Echelon, the Phantoms, and DedSec all use high-tech equipment, but they’re all balanced when it comes to weapons and abilities so none of them has a clear advantage. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">This means you can play as a guerrilla fighter with equipment held together with duct tape, hopes, dreams, and something sticky from the side of the road against modern-day ninjas who can become invisible. Each faction feels like it’s been pulled directly from its setting without being altered too much, and they feel as though they fit with their own lore but also bring the lore of their own games together. </p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">With <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, we have two factions to choose from. The Assassins are definitely the more interesting of the two, so that’s the one I’d like to see implemented most. While they’d need guns to stand a chance in any match, they could follow Echelon and specialize in smaller, quieter weapons but double down on abilities and gear. </p> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="805" data-injectable="true">For example, smoke grenades would provide a fantastic cover to get in close to enemies, especially if an altered camouflage can be used to hide them in their own smoke. From there, Assassins could use a stylized modern Hidden Blade to kill enemies, with a silenced pistol for close encounters that go wrong. At most, this faction should have a mid-range weapon, but it would need to be close-range focused to make the most of the Hidden Blade. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">As for the Templars, they specialize in control, so a faction that somehow dominates the battlefield would be best. I imagine them using advanced weaponry, including sniper rifles, to give them an advantage no matter where they are. I also think that abilities that buff damage when surrounded by enemies would feel right because they’ve always attempted to topple civilizations in groups from within. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">What would tie these factions together well are powerful abilities that mirror one another. For example, the Templars could have deployable spawn points for their allies, and Assassins could have an ability that draws their teammates to them and protects them as they approach, like Ezio whistling for backup before a kill. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft could use dozens of potential abilities to bring<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> into the <em>XDefiant</em> universe, and I believe it would do a great job of it. Regardless of how they work, I know I would be incredibly excited to see and play around as a modern-day Assassin and/or Templar. </p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">That aspect of the universe feels like the best storyline in a good novel, the one that’s told through a few pages every three chapters or so and ends up being the only reason you finish the book. I always desperately want to see a fight between an Assassin with a laser-edged Hidden Blade and a Templar with a high-tech sword in each game, but we never quite get to it. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="false">I can understand developers wanting to keep that sort of thing out of a series that’s based on history, but <em>XDefiant</em> brings factions to life like never before. Just like how history is the playground for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>XDefiant</em> could be the perfect playground for Assassins and Templars if Ubisoft is willing to take a leap of faith and throw them in. </p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> fans were delighted to see Rebirth Island return to <em>Warzone</em> in April 2024, but now fans are wondering if it will leave, and when it could disappear if true. That’s why we’ve put together everything we know about <em>Warzone</em>‘s Rebirth Island and its possible exit. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Rebirth Island made its triumphant return to <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s battle royale on April 3, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-are-demanding-changes-to-sick-joke-rebirth-island-audio/">despite issues with audio</a>, has been welcomed back with open arms. However, some players fear that <em>Warzone</em>‘s map rotation system will mean that it will disappear for months at a time, leaving us unable to play it. </p> <figure data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Rebirth Island is only back, but it could disappear again.

 <h2 id="h-is-rebirth-island-going-to-leave-warzone" data-injectable="false">Is <em>Rebirth Island </em>going to leave <em>Warzone</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false">While it hasn’t been confirmed by Activision yet, <strong>we do expect that Rebirth Island will be included in the <em>Warzone</em> map rotation system.</strong> </p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">That means it could be swapped out for Fortune’s Keep, Ashika Island, or Vondel. This process also sees modes moved in and out of rotation, with Solo, Duos, Trios, and Quads all on the chopping list. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">When could Rebirth Island leave <em>Warzone</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">We don’t know for sure, but we know that Rebirth Island won’t leave until at least May 23, when the next rotation is set to be announced. <strong>The most likely</strong> scenario is that it exits the game on May 29 when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone</em> Season 4</a> starts, but we’ll be sure to update this article when we get official confirmation. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">Don’t panic when it does eventually exit though, as the rotation system means it’s very likely to return before the next <em>CoD</em> game releases in autumn 2024. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to run Rebirth Island before the rumored return of Verdansk, that’s for sure. </p>

  <p id="I8gmhm">A good board game has a lot of layers to it. Narrative layers surround and define a board game’s storyline, while mechanical layers govern the moment-to-moment action. More complex games have a rich strategic layer, with players trying to outfox each other over multiple turns or games. There’s always a social layer as well, which can be as simple as gathering people together to play, or as nuanced as the communication and negotiation skills required to excel at <em>Catan</em>. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24091734/life-in-reterra-eric-lang-interview"><em>Life in Reterra</em></a>, a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games">board game</a> designed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Eric M. Lang</a> and Ken Gruhl with art by <a href="https://mendolaart.com/artists/hugo-cuellar/">Hugo Cuellar</a>, has a layer that many other games don’t — a creative layer. That makes it one of the year’s most interesting new titles.</p>

<p id="G257dd"><em>Life in Reterra</em> posits a far future where urban centers have been taken back by nature, and where notions of humanity’s past exist only as artifacts. It’s up to players to rebuild those cities as they see fit. The art style reflects that conceit well, with brightly colored tiles filled with different biomes as well as the occasional relic, like a smartphone. Players score points for organizing these biomes into contiguous sections, filling the table in front of them with green spaces, deserts, and cheerful lakes or streams.</p>
<p id="qAv3Ys">But the land itself is only the game’s first layer. As players place those tiles, they must constantly consider their orientation in order to create the largest and most valuable biomes that they can, but also to create the foundations needed to place specially shaped buildings on top. And it’s in the placement of these buildings that the game begins to show its true potential.</p>
<p id="cJEjm5">The buildings in <em>Life in Reterra</em> are organized into three different sets, each more complex than the last. In the game’s “starter set,” gardens are worth additional points, but only if you have the largest segment of contiguous terrain on the table. Schools are worth extra points for each different type of relic that you have on the board, and so on. There are three sets in all, presenting a total of 30 different buildings inside the box.</p>

<p id="OAhcCO">Beyond the starter set, the manual for <em>Life in Reterra</em> includes just four more “curated building sets.” The Unfriendly Neighbors Set is confrontational, with players using buildings in ways that dramatically impact the other players at the table. The Peace &amp; Quiet Set, has very very little interaction between players. Meanwhile, the Popularity Contest Set sits somewhere in between. In this way, the game’s mechanical layer can be swapped out at will. Once you make it deep enough into the manual, <em>Life in Reterra</em> becomes something of a platform, a system capable of being different games for different audiences at different times.</p>
<p id="4bZBp5">And then, on the 14th page of the manual, <em>Life in Reterra </em>does something remarkable: It asks players to curate their own sets of buildings to play with. “My Building Sets” reads the two-page spread, revealing a blank worksheet with room for four new ways to play that players can create all on their own.</p>
<p id="P7hNGX">With this final creative layer, <em>Life in Reterra</em> invites players to become designers themselves. The manual, as expertly written as it is, vanishes into the background to become merely a point of reference. The rules are there to facilitate play, not to dictate what the nature of that play should be. In the end, it’s up to individuals to make their own fun, rebuilding the game to meet their needs even as they rebuild the land itself. It’s a bold move — especially for a game targeted at mass market retailers.</p>
<p id="Z5xcKJ">At the same time that Lang, Gruhl, and publisher Hasbro have brought their multi-layered, open-ended design to the toy aisles at Target, they have also elected to bring some of high-end board gaming’s boutique fit and finish as well. <em>Life in Reterra</em> isn’t just a cheap box of cardboard bits and plastic movers. The cards are hefty with a nice linen finish, the wooden meeples are screen-printed, the elegant manual saddle-stitched, and all of the components are stored inside modular plastic trays with transparent lids. Cracking it open, this game looks and feels like something you’d get in the mail after a successful Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p id="u4lsVb"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24091734/life-in-reterra-eric-lang-interview">When I interviewed Lang earlier this year</a>, he called <em>Life in Reterra </em>a “lifestyle game.” At the time, I took that to mean a game that would welcome novices into the larger board gaming hobby and encourage them to make board games a part of their lives. But something more like the opposite is true. <em>Life in Reterra</em> is an incredibly solid and resilient design, which like a collectible card game can be mixed and remixed into multiple different experiences. It is also a game that respects the player’s time, and a physical product that’s built to last. For that reason alone it’s found a permanent place in our home — not in the closet or on a shelf, but right in the middle of the coffee table.</p>
<p id="VnI7Ez">Now, mixed in with all the other urgent detritus of our modern lives — remote controls and smartphones, chewed-up pencils, junk mail, and half-finished homework — is our family’s new favorite board game. <em>Life in Reterra</em> has become something that we return to on a weekly basis, and even when we’re not playing, sometimes we just daydream about the building sets we might come up with for the next go-around.</p>
<p id="rH1MdH"><em>Life in Reterra</em> hasn’t changed our family’s lifestyle, but it has managed to worm its way into it. I think it might easily find a place in your home, too. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-arena-breakout-infinite-release-date-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>If you were one of the lucky few—or many, considering they were handing out beta keys like candy—then you’re likely pretty excited about the Arena Breakout Infinite release date, right? It plays like a free-to-play shooter but with a lot more complexity that should entice casual players from Escape From Tarkov. Being F2P certainly helps, too. So, when’s it coming out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-arena-breakout-infinite-release-date">When is the Arena Breakout Infinite Release Date?</h2>



<p>As of right now, we don’t know the official release date for Arena Breakout Infinite. The studio is still working through the closed beta period, which they said they’ll extend. It’ll likely run until some point this week, around May 22. As for an actual release date for the full version of the game, no one knows just yet.</p>



<p>Considering how well-optimized the beta experience felt from a gameplay perspective, I don’t imagine it’ll take long to iron out any bugs and tweak gameplay mechanics and loadouts. Developer Morefun Studios genuinely wants to compete with many of the big-name extraction shooters, namely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-full-of-cheaters-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov</a>, and they’re seemingly willing to put in the work.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arena-breakout-infinite-like-escape-from-tarkov">Is Arena Breakout Infinite Like Escape From Tarkov?</h2>



<p>In many ways, yeah, Arena Breakout Infinite is quite similar to Escape From Tarkov. It’s an extraction shooter, albeit with a bit more casual playstyle, that heavily focuses on action and loot, like the latter. </p>



<p>Straight off the bat, Arena Breakout Infinite introduces a tutorial that guides you through many of the key systems, including how to properly prepare for a raid with the inventory and loadout mechanics. It’s a useful tooltip that should help many new players find their footing.</p>



<p>Secondly, the overall combat feels more fluid and action-oriented. Whereas Escape From Tarkov is more realistic and hardcore, which can alienate many first-person shooter fans who want something more accessible.</p>



<p>I think both will have their place in the gaming sphere. Arena Breakout Infinite, being free-to-play and casual-friendly, will entice newcomers to the extraction shooter genre. Escape From Tarkov, on the other hand, caters to more hardcore players who enjoy the complexity and realism.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Larian Studios confirmed that it is opening a seventh studio located in Warsaw. </p>



<p>Larian plans to reveal more about Larian Studios Warsaw, including job openings, during the Digital Dragons event beginning today. The devs appear very interested in adding new talent to the Warsaw studio.</p>



<p>Larian Studios explains that it’s the right time to grow the team “with two very ambitious RPGs now starting development.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>*obtains condition Enlarged*</p><p>With two very ambitious RPGs now starting development, what better way to see our visions realised than by growing the team and opening a 7th studio in the heart of Poland’s lively gaming scene!</p><p>Welcome, Larian Studios Warsaw! <a href="https://t.co/hpm2aMdQmy">pic.twitter.com/hpm2aMdQmy</a></p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1792495491256664211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> it began work on two new games last April in a community post. However, the devs consistently make it clear they are not planning to develop new material for Baldur’s Gate.</p>



<p>Despite the enormous success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the devs confirmed they will not work on DLC or a sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a GDC panel</a>. </p>



<p>This will surely disappoint fans of the popular RPG. However, Hasbro did announce in April that it’s still interested in making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-4-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another Baldur’s Gate game</a>, even without Larian. In an interview, Hasbro’s Eugene Evans added that “we’re going to take our time and find the right partner.”</p>



<p>Larian Studios Warsaw will likely work on original IP, and the new studio marks a major opportunity as the industry continues to face layoffs. </p>



<p>Both large and small developers, such as Mighty Kingdom, recently reduced employees. Last month, GTA 6 publisher Take-Two announced it would lay off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5% of its workforce</a> and cancel anticipated games.</p>

The Camerata methodically ripped the city of Cloudbank of not just key citizens, but also character and grace. As protagonist Red cruises through the fading streets of Cloudbank, she witnesses how her surroundings lose color, progressively matching the Camerata's attire. Yet, despite the odds, Transistor reminds us of the importance of latching onto mundanity, and what represents us.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the first examples you encounter is the work of Amelia Garbur, an associate editor who covers the slow decay of Cloudbank. The story of Transistor is told in snippets, emphasizing environmental cues and bite-sized details for you to piece together what transpired in a disappearing district or inside a room before your arrival. Therein come the OVC Terminals, which are posted across the city and offer either surveys or news reported by Garbur, informing the citizens of the latest developments outside their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Incident at the Empty Set," reads a headline detailing the events that transpired at the venue where Red was attacked. "Postponed: Hammers vs. Clientele," says another later that day, indicating that the two popular sports teams won't be playing after all. Toward the evening, "Traverson Hall Is Gone" marks a poignant beginning of the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the citizens you encounter are either soon-to-be or already deceased. Red, using the namesake sword that was originally held by the Camerata, is able to retrieve a fragment of theirs and take them inside. Mechanically, doing so gives you a new ability to mix and match during combat. But this process also adds them to a database, providing information about who they were and what influential role they had in the city.</p><p dir="ltr">Garbur is one of the few characters who avoids this digitization. Instead, her work speaks for herself, right until the bitter end. "As I stand here on the eastern perimeter awaiting the inevitable, I am surrounded by my community, and I am at peace," reads the entry for "Farewell to Cloudbank."</p><div tabindex="0"

href="https://futurism.com/sports-illustrated-ai-generated-writers" rel="nofollow ">Futurism</a> reported on a series of articles in Sports Illustrated that were written by fake writers, their personal information and their work being AI-generated. Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/18/23798164/gizmodo-ai-g-o-bot-stories-jalopnik-av-club-peter-kafka-media-column" rel="nofollow ">resistance from staff</a> under its suite, G/O Media <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots" rel="nofollow ">rolled out AI tools</a> in mid 2023, which quickly proved to just churn <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ai-articles-disinformation-future-g-o-media-rcna95944" rel="nofollow ">factually inaccurate pieces</a>. Others like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cnet-published-ai-generated-stories-then-its-staff-pushed-back/" rel="nofollow ">CNET</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/buzzfeed-ai-creators-news-shut-down-1235483607/" rel="nofollow ">BuzzFeed</a>, the latter shuttering its news division in the process, followed suit. The integrity of the reporters doing the work every day was compromised for the sake of producing articles en masse, even when readers would quickly notice incongruences, as well as a simple lack of human touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The seemingly imposing push for AI extends beyond journalism. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2024/05/13/microsoft-announces-the-largest-investment-to-date-in-france-to-accelerate-the-adoption-of-ai-skilling-and-innovation/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft</a> recently announced a 4 billion euro investment in cloud and AI infrastructure. If you've been trying to search for something on Google and received a garbled response, it's possible that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/13/google-ai-search-io-sge/">it wasn't written by a human being</a> at all. From dating apps like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ai-personas-are-future-dating-bumble-founder-says-many-arent-buying-rcna151738" rel="nofollow ">Bumble</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">voice acting</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-with-ai/1100-6520074/">development tools</a> for video games, CEOs and corporations are betting on a future where they can further automate not only jobs, but our everyday lives, despite the proven <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/22/ai-jobs-humans-cost-mit-study/" rel="nofollow ">monetary</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24066646/ai-electricity-energy-watts-generative-consumption" rel="nofollow ">environmental</a> costs, workers' livelihoods notwithstanding.</p><p dir="ltr">Sadly, AI also goes hand in hand with deep fakes, which are digitally generated images or videos that mimic the likeness of a real person, whether it is their image or their voice. During the Met Gala, images of artists like Rihanna and Katy Perry went viral, despite being fake. In Arizona, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/08/arizona-election-workers-trained-with-deepfakes-prepare-2024/">workers are being trained</a> to prepare themselves for misleading images ahead of the 2024 elections. In March, New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/aoc-deepfakes-defiance-act-1234979373/" rel="nofollow ">announced</a> she's co-leading the <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/defiance_act_of_2024.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Defiance Act of 2024</a>, which would allow <a href="https://www.vox.com/24145522/ai-deepfake-apps-teens-ban-laws" rel="nofollow ">victims of deep-fake</a> creations to sue the people behind them.</p><p dir="ltr">The dystopian future depicted in Transistor isn't filled with one-on-one premonitions of our current reality. Yet, the parallels hit too close to home for comfort. There's an enemy type that "attacks" Red by taking pictures of her. During New Game Plus, one of the bosses sings a corrupted, digitized rendition of the song that was played during the fight originally, mimicking Red's voice. Witnessing Cloudbank being consumed by a rampant and uniform process resonates with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/05/arts/video-games-internet.html">digital homogenization</a>, and how human interactions are being diminished by the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/first-gen-social-media-users-have-nowhere-to-go/" rel="nofollow ">online spaces</a> we inhabit.</p><p dir="ltr">Revisiting these themes through a modern-day lens can leave us with a defeated feeling. But the central message of Transistor is one of hope, not despair, reminding us that the human touch can be mimicked, but never replaced.</p><p dir="ltr">Red leaves the sword outside a restroom before entering, being playful while maintaining a now begone boundary with his partner, who's stuck inside of the weapon. Further into the story, she uses one of the OVC Terminals to communicate with her companion, if only for a brief moment, twisting the original purpose of leaving a comment under an article. Even without her voice, she can't stop herself from humming over the heart-soothing songs that play in the background throughout her entire journey, refusing to abandon her artistic spirit.</p><p dir="ltr">As companies continue to be hellbent on attempting to replace human identities, obsessed with the idea of succumbing to a reality forged by algorithms and faux tech revolutions, Transistor remains inspiring 10 years later. It's comforting to know that the silk in Red's dress remains silk until the bitter end, despite the attempts to imitate her liking. There's a special solace in knowing she's reading news from an actual human being, even as the city collapses around her.</p>

Figma toys are some of the best when it comes to striking a pose, as they have an incredible range of articulation, plenty of accessories, and fantastic detail. Legend of Zelda fans can choose from two Link figures to add to their collection, as the standard version and the DX edition are both up for preorder. Amazon initially sold out of its preorders for the standard and DX versions of the figure, but the standard edition is back in stock for $70. The figure doesn't release until next summer, but you won't be charged for your preorder at Amazon until your order ships.</p><ul><li><strong>Amazon</strong><ul><li><a

figures feature the same overall design--a colorful and sharp sculpt from the talented hands of Shinji Koshinuma at Max Factory--and you can essentially make Link do any pose you want thanks to the wealth of joints on this figure. Want him to glide around your room, kneel on a rock to survey the land around him, or have him swing the Master Sword around to clear the space around him? You can do just that and more with this Figma figure.</p><p>Both figures come with three faces you can easily swap in or out--smiling, neutral, and shouting faces--a Master Sword, Hylian Shield, Hylian hood, and a base to pose Link on. The DX version comes with many extras, including a paraglider, rocket, rocket effect parts, Construct bow, arrows, Ascend ability effect parts, traveler's shield, rock hammer, and King Rauru's right arm. These are expected to ship out in 2025, but if you're looking for some other Legend of Zelda figures to help you pass the time, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+legend+of+zelda+figma&amp;crid=RWTCB7SFCJ67" rel="nofollow ">there are several options</a>.</p><p>The new Tears of the Kingdom Link figure isn't the only premium Zelda collectible on the horizon. Bandai Namco's Tamashii Nations collectible brand is releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-master-sword-replica-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6523376/" data-ref-id="1100-6523376">a beautiful replica of the Master Sword</a> later this year.

                <p dir="ltr">In what capacity remains to be seen, but Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare Season 4 will see mecha from Gundam appear in the game. A new teaser shows the shadow of one of the giant robots appearing on a building.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Call of Duty account <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1792238845557133808" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter) teased the Gundam crossover. Along with the short 10-second clip, the post says: "It's time for the shadows to rise up" with an emoji of crossed swords.

                <p>Take-Two recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is now targeting a release in Fall 2025, and CEO Strauss Zelnick is pretty sure the game will make it out on time.</p><p>"There is slippage in the industry, and we're not immune from that. However, we narrowed the timing [of GTA 6] because we are highly confident in that timing," he told CNBC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4KEJAdVXzo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r4KEJAdVXzo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previously, GTA VI was set for release at an unspecified point in 2025. It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games release gets delayed</a>, so it's possible GTA VI might slip, as Zelnick mentioned was possible.</p><p>Zelnick also recently talked about how GTA VI's release date <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">"probably doesn't matter"</a> given the immense hype for it. However, he acknowledged that releasing in the fall--when people spend lots of money on gifts for the holidays--is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">advantageous for GTA VI.</a></p><p>In the CNBC interview, Zelnick was pressed to say more about what makes GTA VI a step up over GTA V. He declined to get into specifics but noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">the trailer</a>, released in December, teases a lot of what is "new and different" for GTA VI.</p><p>Zelnick also talked about how Rockstar's aim is to make GTA VI a game that <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1792239837098996117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"no one has ever seen before."</a> He added, "Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do."</p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was described as "Trailer 1," so fans are expecting to see another trailer at some point in the future. There continue to be many unanswered questions about GTA VI, one of which is what will happen to GTA Online when the new game comes out.

            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 maker Larian Studios has announced that it will be opening a new expansion in Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>The new office joins the developer's locations in Quebec, Dublin, Guildford, Barcelona, Ghent, and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Larian intends to expand its current 24-development cycle and ramp up development on its next titles with the addition of its seventh studio.</p>
<p>The game maker said that Larian Studios Warsaw "is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency."</p>
<p>"We're a very bottom-up company, so I'm eager to see what new things they'll bring us. I think it'll work really well," said Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-after-baldurs-gate-3-we-have-ambitions-to-make-really-good-rpgs-and-thats-sufficient">GamesIndustry.biz spoke with Swen Vincke on Baldur's Gate 3, moving on from the RPG and sustainability within the industry</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-are-joining-the-joker-in-multiversus-first-proper-season/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-are-joining-the-joker-in-multiversus-first-proper-season<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="344" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It seems Player First Games is pulling out all the stops to convince people to give <em>MultiVersus</em> another chance when it re-launches. Aside from everyone’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mark-hamill-set-to-voice-the-joker-in-his-multiversus-roster-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favourite clown criminal the Joker joining the roster</a>, a new launch trailer has confirmed two more additions: <em>Friday the 13th</em>‘s Jason Voorhees and <em>The Matrix</em>‘s Agent Smith.</p> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Jason’s inclusion had leaked over the weekend, but Agent Smith certainly took me by surprise. Given the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-new-multiversus-joker-trailer-has-basically-confirmed-the-powerpuff-girls-are-on-their-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent teases for The Powerpuff Girls</a>, I’d have thought they’d be the next character reveal. Despite those three seeming like a guarantee, Player First Games has only confirmed Joker, Jason, and Agent Smith for <em>Multiversus</em>‘ first proper season of content, now titled Puns &amp; Villainy. Joker and Jason will be available at launch on May 28, while Agent Smith is only said to be releasing later into the season.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Launch Trailer &quot;Stars Collide. Pies Fly.&quot;" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qX5AUVIAg_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="679" data-current-count="979" data-injectable="true">The trailer doesn’t show how either Jason or Smith will play; in fact, it doesn’t have any gameplay at all and is another aggressive reminder of how many Warner Bros. IPs are being represented. The whole thing is still rather amusing (particularly Velma from <em>Scooby-Doo</em> using speech bubbles to fight Bugs Bunny and the Joker), and I can’t help but get a little hyped seeing Joker summon Jason and Smith to his side as he sits on the Iron Throne from <em>Game of Thrones</em>. The game is also meant to be getting Banana Guard from Adventure Time, as confirmed in <a href="https://youtu.be/sT1zXiYqcfA?si=huLHYDHJkaf8tuqR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a trailer from last week</a>, but there’s no mention of whether they’re part of season one as well.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">It’s not just new characters, though. Recently, Player First confirmed there’ll be PvE content for all the solo players in the form of Rift Mode. Rifts are essentially different types of challenges that follow a specific theme, and they’re not always traditional battles. Some fights will have modifiers, like infinite jumping, and there’ll be minigames and boss battles too.</p> <p data-characters="775" data-current-count="1174" data-injectable="false">All in all, <em>MultiVersus </em>seems to be doing everything right to try and curry back favour after it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-beta-officially-offline-to-return-early-2024-but-for-whom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unceremoniously went offline last year</a>. What’s important is what comes after launch. Having a bunch of new characters and additional modes is great for enticing players, but it’ll need to keep up a steady stream of content that keeps those players invested. I’m especially curious to see how often new characters will be rolled out. While it’s important not to keep fans waiting too long for them, having three or four in one season alone almost feels like too much at once, and risks making each new addition feel not as special. This is only the first season, though, so maybe Player First is starting big and will dial it back with subsequent seasons.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-reveals-jason-voorhees-and-agent-smith-in-new-trailer.875664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-jason-agent-smith<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros' crossover platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>has gained two more characters, and they're both iconic movie villains who should send a shiver up the spine of even the most stalwart hero.</p>

<p>In a new trailer released earlier today, Warner Bros and developer Player First Games revealed that&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th&nbsp;</em>slasher Jason Voorhees and&nbsp;<em>The Matrix</em>'s Agent Smith will both be playable in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</p>

<p>They're introduced in the trailer as The Joker's accomplices; the Clown Prince of Crime, voiced once again by Mark Hamill, says he usually works alone, but he'll "make an exception" in this instance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-jason-agent-smith-the-joker.jpg?itok=lKxcPDLt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-jason-agent-smith-the-joker.jpg?itok=7WYr9Ri2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wouldn't want to come across these three in a dark alley. Or a well-lit one, come to that.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't get to see much more of either Jason or Agent Smith, so we don't know how they'll play just yet, but Jason looks positively massive, so expect a juggernaut-style moveset from him.</p>

<p>If Agent Smith's portrayal is anything like it is in the movies, we can expect anything from martial arts through to fighting with an army of clones from him. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Jason and Agent Smith are the two latest characters to be revealed for&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>since its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">full relaunch was announced back in March</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scheduled for May,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>1.0 will include a host of changes, including new characters and stages, a shift to Unreal Engine 5, and rebuilt netcode that should improve the game's online stability a tad.</p>




<p><em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-leaks-prove-true-as-wb-unveils-platform-fighter">revealed in 2021</a>, then subsequently released in beta the following year. Following its initial launch, the game's roster expanded to include characters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-multiversus-update-adds-rick-sanchez-xp-nerf">Rick Sanchez</a>, his nephew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-season-1-patch-notes-includes-morty-release-date">Morty</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-adam-multiversus-patch-changes-hierarchy-of-power">Black Adam</a>.</p>

<p>Other characters confirmed for the game's 1.0 release include The Joker and, um,&nbsp;<em>Adventure Time</em>'s <a href="https://x.com/multiversus/status/1791514032932814886" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana Guard</a>.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>also includes stages based on locations from&nbsp;<em>The Powerpuff Girls&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dexter's Laboratory</em>, so characters from those shows seem like a sure thing at this point.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/multiversus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/multiversus/9ndkxxbl90gf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on May 28th. It'll be free-to-play, so make sure to download it and check it out if you're looking for a distinctly Warner Bros-themed take on&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>mastermind and legendary auteur Hideo Kojima has revealed that the filming and recording process for the upcoming sequel is complete.</p>

<p>In a recent radio interview (via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202405/5569" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu</a>, with thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2-filming-completed-according-to-hideo-kojima/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> for additional reporting), Kojima said that the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>development team has finished recording and filming scenes with the game's cast.</p>

<p>That cast includes returning stars like Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, and Troy Baker, as well as new additions like&nbsp;<em>Mad Max: Fury Road&nbsp;</em>director George Miller and actress Elle Fanning.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-filming-completed-moon.jpg?itok=vYjVuHDt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-filming-completed-moon.jpg?itok=54tgvcmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kojima Productions has finished filming and recording on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Kojima, now that filming and recording are complete,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will enter what he calls an "adjustment phase", during which gameplay mechanics will be tightened up and scene transitions will be refined.</p>

<p>Kojima says this phase of the game's development will last for about a year. It's important to stress that this doesn't mean&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>will launch in May next year; there may well be more work to do after this "adjustment phase" before the game is ready for release.</p>

<p>However, this does indicate that production on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>seems to be progressing smoothly, which, given a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">spate</a> of recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delays</a>&nbsp;in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed">industry</a>, is pretty impressive.</p>

<p>In the radio interview, Kojima also says that the recent&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>trailer, which was released during January's PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-january-2024-recap-heck-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">State of Play showcase</a>, was intended to showcase what the game would inherit from its predecessor and what connections the characters would share.</p>

<p>You can take another look at that trailer below, just in case you missed it the first time around.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is the upcoming sequel to 2019's open-world "walking simulator" (ahem)&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>.</p>

<p>The game was officially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">revealed during The Game Awards in 2022</a>, having already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-confirmed-by-norman-reedus">confirmed by returning star Norman Reedus</a>, who will once again play Sam Porter-Bridges in the sequel.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, Hideo Kojima is also preparing to expand his new franchise into the world of cinema thanks to an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24">movie collaboration with celebrated indie house A24</a>.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>is currently slated for launch on PS5 sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more info on this one.</p>

			<p>Today, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios announced the opening of a new office in Warsaw, Poland. Swen Vincke, CEO of Larian Studios, said:</p>
<p><em>Visiting GIC last year confirmed what I'd been thinking for a while - there's a lot of talent here and a lot of devs who think like us. On top of that, many of them want to work on RPGs, so it's a match made in heaven. Our plan for the Polish studio is very simple. Build a team that can work on our two - very ambitious - new RPGs and enjoy the fruits of their labor. We're a very bottom up company so I'm eager to see what new things they'll bring us. I think it'll work really well.</em></p>
<p>Ula Jach, Head of Studio, stated:</p>
<p><em>The decision to open a permanent studio in Warsaw shows how serious we are about encouraging creativity, collaboration, and innovation in the heart of Poland's lively gaming scene. We're thrilled for the opportunity to collaborate with the abundant talent and expertise of the region, especially considering Poland's strong reputation as a hub for RPG and gaming enthusiasts.</em></p>
<p>The studio website adds:</p>
<p><em>Larian Studios set up base in one of the greatest RPG development hubs in the world - Poland, where we opened our doors in the historic city of Warsaw. Like its sister studios across the globe, Larian Studios Warsaw is dedicated to fostering an environment where developers can thrive creatively and reclaim their agency. Systems-heavy RPGs need best-in-class developers, that’s why we've put the people who build those systems at the center of our culture.</em></p>
<p><em>As the team ramps up development on our next games, we’re excited to meet talented programmers, RPG designers, writers, and more who are local to Poland or interested in relocating. The studio’s location in the heart of Poland offers everything that you might want to enjoy: mountains, the sea, lakes, rivers, national parks, and even a desert. And it even provides direct flight access to many European destinations, connecting us to our sister studios across Europe, North America, and Asia.</em></p>
<p>The Warsaw office is Larian Studios' seventh, joining Ghent, Dublin, Guildford, Barcelona, Kuala Lumpur, and Quebec. There are currently seven open positions for this office, as you can read <a href="https://larian.com/careers/location/warsaw?location=warsaw&amp;mc_cid=ade0eaf425&amp;mc_eid=22f0f6c8d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Larian Studios recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it is not going to make Baldur's Gate 3 DLC or Baldur's Gate 4. It is instead going to do its own thing <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the two original projects</a> mentioned in the statements above. Interestingly, CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-ceo-has-a-lot-of-respect-for-bethesda-is-trying-not-to-grow-his-studio-too-much/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a while ago he was resisting the studio's push to grow - looks like he lost that fight.</p>

(Shout-out to my home town of Guildford, the most mediocre place in all of England.) It’s downright peculiar that Larian is only making two games, given its scale, but it hasn’t announced the two games it’s working on, (though one of them is <em>obviously</em> a new <em>Divinity</em>), so it’s not like there’s a reason to fudge that number.</p><figure id="" data-id="aea19fb2409f6d1c50b888b0c1aec6d1" data-recommend-id="image://aea19fb2409f6d1c50b888b0c1aec6d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2383" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My Baldur's Gate 3 character looking striking against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="My Baldur's Gate 3 character looking striking against a red background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Larian Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aea19fb2409f6d1c50b888b0c1aec6d1" data-recommend-id="image://aea19fb2409f6d1c50b888b0c1aec6d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2383" data-height="1340" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My Baldur's Gate 3 character looking striking against a red background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The company’s success is even more impressive when you remember that its earliest three games, the <em>Divine Divinity</em> series, were pretty average. Not many game studios can build an empire on 6s and 7s, but then in 2014, Larian blew everyone’s expectations out of the water with the surprise brilliance of <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em>, a prequel to 2002's original <em>Divine Divinity</em>, and thus—counterintuitively—a fresh start. The Kickstarter-funded project was made for a budget of only €4 million ($4.3m), and was a big success. But nothing compared to its 2017 sequel, which earned $2 million from Kickstarter, and a protracted Early Access development that would shape how Larian approached <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><p>The fantasy threequel picked up where a now pretty bereft BioWare left off and had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a reported budget</a></span> of $100,000,000—more than 20 times the money behind <em>DOS.</em> Larian is obviously now an apocalyptically different company. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/baldurs-gate-3-revenue-microtransactions-trends-video-games-fortnite-hogwarts-legacy-2024-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/baldurs-gate-3-revenue-microtransactions-trends-video-games-fortnite-hogwarts-legacy-2024-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s reported</a></span> that <em>BG3</em> made over $650 million in 2023 alone, recovering its budget with half a billion to spare. Even assuming hefty chunks went to the Forgotten Realms license owners, Hasbro, you can see why Larian would be looking for ways to expand.<br></p><p>We know that neither of the projects the company says it’s currently working on has anything to do with the Forgotten Realms, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">Vincke having made that clear at 2024's GDC</a></span>, but assuming one is a <em>Divinity</em> sequel, that leaves open the exciting idea that there could be a new, completely original IP in the works. With no publisher above Larian pulling its strings, and no shareholders to demand numbers go up, it’s one of very few studios in a position to take such a risk, and clearly possesses the talent to deliver.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-destroyed-arkane-austin-but-the-studios-soul-is-indestructible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>15 minutes into Prey, the 2017 sci-fi thriller crafted by Arkane Austin, protagonist Morgan Yu shatters their apartment window with a wrench. As hundreds of glass shards fall away, a newly revealed truth changes Morgan’s life forever. This genuinely shocking, perspective-pivoting opening is one of the most incredible introductions to a game world ever made. </p><p>Seven days into May 2024, Microsoft took up its own metaphorical wrench and shattered Arkane Austin. A veteran of immersive sims – those first-person, highly interactive games where RPG, simulation, and action systems interlock – it was one of the casualties of Xbox’s brutal dismemberment of Bethesda Softworks. </p><p>This is a heartbreaking situation. Staff laid off from Arkane Austin have been thrown into the toughest conditions the games industry has ever seen. But, if you’ll permit me to search for the light in this darkness, the soul of the studio has already proven itself incredibly resilient. This is not the first time that financials and parent companies have dictated the course of the immersive sim in Austin, Texas. Despite multiple hardships, the genre always finds a way to survive in this city.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/dishonored-brigmore-witches-dlc-1716202277783.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dishonored's Brigmore Witches DLC doubled down on the strange and eldritch.</figcaption></figure></output><p>First, let’s reflect on what has been taken. The messy and misguided co-op shooter Redfall may be Arkane Austin’s most recent release, but the studio is built on a rich history of single-player innovation. It crafted two timeless classics: the eldritch stealth sim Dishonored (built cooperatively with Arkane’s surviving Lyon studio) and Prey, a modern day reinterpretation of the brilliant System Shock. And according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, before Microsoft’s guillotine fell, Arkane Austin was already drawing up the blueprints for a new single-player game that drew on the team’s proven skills.  </p><p>It’s impossible to know what that game would be, but if Dishonored and Prey are evidence of anything, then we’ve lost something with incredible potential. Dishonored demonstrates Arkane Austin’s talent for deeply interactive game worlds that respect and reflect player experimentation. Prey’s sprawling space station, meanwhile, is testament to the team’s vision when it comes to environment and campaign structure. Its roguelike DLC Mooncrash, with its overlapping stories of five protagonists, allows for inspired use of a single space depending on both who you play as and the order that you play their stories in. Both games also showcase Arkane’s unrivalled art design and fierce, anti-injustice narrative prowess – strengths even Redfall benefits from.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arkane Austin's soul is a community; a growing collective of immersive sim designers that have endured success and hardship in the city of Austin for three decades. </p></div><p>Arkane Austin's approach to game design was genuinely beautiful – an elegance matched by few other studios. And, in a drive for soulless corporate number counting, Microsoft has destroyed it. </p><p>In Microsoft’s own multi-part documentary Power On: The Story of Xbox, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-lionhead-studios-mistake">segment discussing the company’s woeful mistreatment of Lionhead Studios</a> saw Phil Spencer say “You acquire a studio for what they’re great at now, and your job is to help them accelerate how they do what they do, not them accelerate what you do.” </p><p>You’d assume, then, that Xbox would want to foster Arkane Austin. To help it overcome the failure of Redfall and resume – to quote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Xbox’s own Matt Booty</a> – “making impactful and innovative games”. But if a highly profitable corporation worth over <em>$3 trillion</em> has no interest in absorbing one mistake and finding a way to shepherd its artists to success, then one thing is clear: that promise to help studios “accelerate” what they’re good at is empty. </p><p>Arkane Austin may be gone, but the people still remain. And that brings me back to the studio’s soul. That soul is a community; a growing collective of immersive sim designers that have endured success and hardship in the city of Austin for close to three decades.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/redfall-1716202705586.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Redfall's online and open world ambitions may have faltered, but its art never did. </figcaption></figure></output><p>The city’s link to immersive sims began in 1995. Looking Glass Studios, the East coast-based creator of the genre’s formative trio – Ultima Underworld, System Shock, and Thief – tasked System Shock producer Warren Spector with opening a new office in Austin, Texas. But while Looking Glass’ games proved critical hits, financial difficulties eventually saw the company collapse in 2000. The design language it established proved indestructible, though, and had already fled the nest. </p><p>Spector had been coaxed away by John Romero, the rockstar designer of Doom. Recently fired by id Software, Romero had set up his own studio, Ion Storm, and he wanted Spector to take charge of the Austin office to make, well, pretty much whatever he wanted. That project was the landmark immersive sim Deus Ex. Hired to help Spector craft this conspiracy thriller were designers Harvey Smith, Steve Powers, Monte Martinez, and Ricardo Bare.</p><p>This new Austin studio didn’t just keep the immersive sim recipe alive. When Looking Glass collapsed, Ion Storm’s parent company, Eidos Interactive, secured the rights to Thief and helped Spector relocate many former Looking Glass staff to his Austin studio to continue work on the franchise. But this second home for the immersive sim wasn’t to last. In 2005, financial struggles at Eidos doomed Ion Storm to the same fate as its spiritual predecessor. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Good art transcends board room statistics. And against all odds, the immersive sim has always found a way to bloom in Austin. </p></div><p>The demise of Ion Storm could have been the end of the road for the immersive sim community in Austin. Even worse, the genre was endangered. Few other studios were interested in making this style of game. One that was, however, was Arkane. A French studio founded by Raphaël Colantonio, its first title, Arx Fatalis, was a love letter to Ultima Underworld. And in 2006 Arkane expanded into the US. Austin was an obvious choice.  </p><p>Arkane Austin became a rally point to reunite key members of the Ion Storm team. Colantonio hired Harvey Smith as co-creative director, and he was soon followed by Powers, Martinez, and Bare. Once again, the city of Austin had another studio in which to foster and grow the creativity and ingenuity that began at Looking Glass Studios. </p><p>Thanks to Arkane’s two-studio system, the immersive sim mindset that made its home in Austin now extends across continents. Over at the thankfully unscathed Arkane Lyon, visionaries such as Dinga Bakaba, Sébastien Mitton, and Dana Nightingale are keeping the genre’s values alive, despite many of them not having direct ties back to Ion Storm or Looking Glass. Meanwhile, Raphaël Colantonio’s new company, WolfEye Studios (set up in 2019 following his departure from Arkane after directing Prey) is staffed by a variety of immersive sim veterans, including Monte Martinez, as well as enthusiastic newcomers. And beyond these headline developers, a multitude of indie games inspired by Arkane’s lineage, such as Gloomwood and Ctrl Alt Ego, are adding new voices to the fold. The genre endures because good art transcends board room statistics. </p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="de" dir="ltr">Arkane Austin 2017 <a href="https://t.co/zDCB2vUitI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zDCB2vUitI</a></p>— Raphael Colantonio (@rafcolantonio) <a href="https://twitter.com/rafcolantonio/status/1792044354736902289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what of Austin and its long-surviving immersive sim community? Harvey Smith, Steve Powers, and Ricardo Bare, creatives who have seen the city’s studios live and die, were all at Arkane Austin the day that Microsoft’s destruction order came through. Things are, admittedly, different this time. Arkane Austin’s shuttering wasn’t because of the so-called “immersive sim curse” of the genre being doomed to commercial failure. When a <em>$3 trillion</em> corporation won’t even support a studio whose game is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore">a success “in all key measurements and expectations”</a>, then it’s not about money. It’s sadly just cultural vandalism by capitalism, which is something of a new hurdle for immersive sims to navigate.</p><p>But, as I said earlier, good art transcends board room statistics. And against all odds, the immersive sim has always found a way to bloom in Austin. In a thread of thoughts <a href="https://x.com/Harvey1966/status/1788155208997970260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on X/Twitter</a>, Harvey Smith wrote “part of me is also wondering about team size, the role of certain types of creative groups, the role of bigger companies, etc. Maybe there is a sweet spot for the types of games I am driven to make in terms of team size?” Finding that sweet spot might be the first step to whatever comes next.</p><p>We can’t ignore that 2024 is the worst time for video game creatives in history, and Arkane Austin’s former staff face an uphill battle that can’t be solved with simple faith in the genre’s resilience. Nonetheless, the soul of Arkane Austin has roots that have been proven to be seemingly indestructible. And history does have a knack of repeating itself. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. <br>Header art: Fred Augis, Arkane Studios / Bethesda</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Warner Bros. and Player First Games announced they would be adding iconic Batman villain The Joker to the MultiVersus roster when it relaunches on May 28. Today, two more villainous additions--Friday The 13th's Jason Voorhees and The Matrix's Agent Smith--were revealed via a new launch trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer highlights matchups between previously featured members of the roster, like Finn from Adventure Time teaming with Velma from Scooby Doo and Wonder Woman doing battle with alternate versions of herself. The scene then shifts to the throne room from Game of Thrones, where The Joker taunts the heroes flanked by Jason and Agent Smith.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Jason Voorhees is making his second-ever guest appearance in a fighting game, after he featured as a downloadable character in 2015's Mortal Kombat X. Agent Smith, meanwhile, has only featured in four video games total since the debut of The Matrix, with the most recent being a cameo appearance in Lego Dimensions as part of the Lego Batman Movie pack.</p><p dir="ltr">After being removed from online stores for nearly a year, MultiVersus will return with a completely revamped fighting system, new rollback netcode, a reworked economy and more. Along with the three new characters, two new stages--one set in Townsville from The Powerpuff Girls, the other in Dexter's Laboratory--will be part of the rotation, as well as a new PvE mode with branching paths and themed events.</p><p dir="ltr">MultiVersus will launch as a free-to-play title for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on May 28.</p>

Games have released the launch trailer for its upcoming platform fighter, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, seemingly revealing&nbsp;<em>Friday the 13th's&nbsp;</em>Jason Voorhees and <i>The Matrix's&nbsp;</i>Agent Smith as new roster additions. This trailer arrives just a few weeks after we learned <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/11/multiversus-is-back-in-action-this-may">MultiVersus finally (re)launches next week</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After roughly two minutes of MultiVersus hijinks with various characters from the game, the Joker, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-joker-voiced-by-mark-hamill-joins-multiversus">which we recently learned is joining the game with a voice by Mark Hamill</a>, is seen sitting on&nbsp;the Iron Throne of&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones&nbsp;</em>fame. Then, mysteriously, Jason and Agent Smith appear beside him, likely alluding to them joining the launch day roster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the MultiVersus launch trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/serve-taskmaster-at-home-when-taskmaster-vr-releases-this-june<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How comfortable are you with the destruction of hundreds of eggs and melons? Will you be able to make mundane household objects do mildly impressive things? We'll all have a chance when <em>Taskmaster VR</em> releases on June 13th.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/i-become-bit-more-annoying-alex-horne-talks-taskmaster-vr">Check out our interview with Alex Horne about making Taskmaster VR</a></em>.</p>

<p>A quick rundown for those unfamiliar with the show:&nbsp;<em>Taskmaster </em>sees five people compete in a series of oddball tasks -- like painting a horse while riding a horse --&nbsp; with no real idea how their performance may be judged. The Taskmaster views their attempts to complete a task and makes judgement on who did best and worst.</p>

<p>We'll soon have the opportunity to experience that ourselves, including the scorn or admiration from The Taskmaster himself, Lord Greg Davies. Of course, his trusty assistance Alex Horne will be featured heavily throughout the game as well.</p>

<p>Much like the show, the game will be structured around "episodes" of tasks over the course of a series to determine an overall winner.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Beyond these handcrafted tasks, by both the dev team at Scallywag Arcade with the help of Alex Horne, we can all make our own tasks, too. When the game first releases, you can set up tasks anywhere in or outside the Taskmaster house with all sorts of objects.</p>

<p>The task creation tools will only expand further as well, with the team at Scallywag stating they have big plans to expand the feature after the game's release.</p>

<p>In a release they said they want to add "enhanced sharing, more interactive objects and locations, crafting - and more" while asking the community to help identify what they want to see in the game.</p>

<p>Along with the release date, you can now <a href="https://scallywag.drawandcode.com/taskmaster/">pre-order <em>Taskmaster VR</em></a> if you wish.</p>

<p><em>Taskmaster VR</em> will be coming to Meta Quest and SteamVR. No word on if or when it may come to PlayStation VR at some point in the future</p>
