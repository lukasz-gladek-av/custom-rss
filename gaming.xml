		<p>A second closed beta for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls has been announced and it launches December 5, 2025 at midnight Pacific Time. It will run until December 7 at 11:59 PM. On the 5th and 6th of December you will be able to battle both online and with CPU opponents, with this being reduced to online only on the 7th of&nbsp; December.</p>
<p>You should be able to<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/"> sign up for the closed beta here.</a></p>

<p>The six playable characters from the first beta, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Ms Marvel, Storm, Captain America and Star-Lord, will be joined by Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Two new stages, Savage Land and the X-Mansion have been added to the beta. You will also be able to use the communal space and spectate games.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback received from the previous closed beta, we’ve implemented numerous improvements, including balance adjustments, performance optimizations, visual enhancements, and user experience upgrades. More details will be shared as we get closer to the beta test,” explains Kazuto Sekine, Game Director and Lead Battle Designer.</p>

<p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Soulsis a tag fighter but it is pushing the boundary to be a 4v4 system. There are different ways to approach it. You can use one fighter with the other three in the team being assists, or swap through each character to work out the different styles that they have.</p>
<p>The game is a big collaboration between Sony, Marvel and Arc System Works, who have developed some of the most celebrated fighting games of the past decade including Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dragon Ball FighterZ, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote,&nbsp;“By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</p>

		<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have revealed a DLC expansion for Elden Ring: Nightreign,and it’s coming out soon. Really soon. Elden Ring: Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows will launch on 4th December 2025. That’s less than a month away!</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Forsaken Hollows will bring additional Nightfarers, Bosses and more into the multiplayer spin-off to one of FromSoftware’s most beloved games.</p>
<p>The update will introduce the Scholar and the Undertaker as two new playable Nightfarers. They’re described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar</strong> –&nbsp;An academic who walks the Lands Between. Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.</li>
<li><strong>Undertaker –</strong>&nbsp;An abbess who was mandated to slay the Nightlord. Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two new bosses will also feature in this DLC expansion, and there will be the new area of The Great Hollow, which adds a cavity to explore under Limveld. This includes exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers from forgotten peoples, and crystals and have a life-draining miasma that you’ll probably want to avoid.</p>

<p>Those that pre-order the DLC will receive a digital artbook and mini soundtrack as downloadable apps, though these were previously available as part of the Deluxe Edition and Deluxe Upgrade Pack. In fact, The Forsaken Hollows DLC is included for those who bought the Collectors Edition or Deluxe Edition of Nightreign.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign didn’t gather quite the same level of acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

			<p>Just as the community <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">was bemoaning the lack of post-launch support</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a> that new DLC is coming to Elden Ring Nightreign, and it'll arrive before the end of the year. The new expansion, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>This paid DLC expansion adds a few new features to the game, with two new playable Nightfarers to players to try out, two new bosses that FromSoftware is currently being quite tight-lipped about, and what sounds like a new area to explore within Limveld.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are called the Scholar and the Undertaker. The Scholar is described as "<em>boasting impressive arcane levels,</em>" and gains "<em>incredible advantages through battlefield observation</em>," while the Undertaker features "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>."</p>



<p>It's not exactly an in-depth description of either character's kit, but it's seemingly all we get for now. We'll definitely learn more the closer we get to the DLC's launch.</p>



<p>As far as the new bosses, all FromSoftware marketing representative Miku Watanabe has to say in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation Blog post</a> is: "<em>Players will confront two new bosses tormenting Limveld</em>." So, it seems like the new bosses also go in the category of, 'things we'll learn about later.'</p>



<p>Lastly, the DLC also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that has opened up in Limveld that players will get to explore in the new DLC, described as a place that is "<em>strewn with exotic ruins and temples; sacred towers denoting the remains of an ancient people; and crystals that exude a cursed, life-draining miasma</em>."</p>



<p>The DLC will be available for $15 USD, though if you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Nightreign, then you'll just get the DLC added to your library when it arrives on December 4, 2025. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to learn more about the DLC.</p>

<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls got a new trailer during today’s State of Play Japan. In it, the second closed beta was announced, alongside who’ll be included.</p>







<p>Revealed in June, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-tokon-ps5-closed-beta-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fighter from ARC System Works</a>, creators of Guilty Gear, teams up with the superheroes of Marvel. Many have already gotten their hands on it with the closed beta and at EVO. Given ARC System Works’ track record, it’s safe to say it’ll be one to watch. Now, thanks to today’s State of Play, we have a bit more information on when the next chance to play will be.</p>



<h2 id="h-second-closed-beta-for-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-coming-december-5th-7th-2025">Second Closed Beta for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls Coming December 5th-7th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, seen above, we get a look at some new gameplay of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We see new stages, including the X-Mansion with some familiar faces. Most importantly, we see a new closed beta announced for PlayStation 5. The beta will occur from December 5th through December 7th and run all 72-hours. New characters not in the first beta include Spider-Man and Ghost Rider.</p>



<p>Via <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-2-arrives-dec-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the PlayStation Blog</a>, the beta will be open to all who participated in the first one. Furthermore, those who expressed interest but didn’t get in will now be considered for this one. As for the schedule, on&nbsp;December 5 and 6, CPU battles and online matches will be available, with&nbsp;December 7 being only online battles.</p>



<p>The roster, for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls includes Iron Man, Captain America, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Storm, Ghost Rider, and Doctor Doom. More characters are expected to join before the game’s 2026 release. There are a ton of heroes to choose from, so the possibilities are somewhat infinite. Still, it’ll be exciting to see how ARC System Works approaches these characters and how they may differ from other Marvel fighting titles.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>'s new major DLC update has finally been revealed. Titled The Forsaken Hollows, the DLC was announced during tonight's Sony State of Play livestream through a new trailer.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is set to release on 4th December. In the trailer, we see footage of some familiar characters, before revealing additional bosses on the way. That includes the iconic Artorias from Dark Souls - much requested by players - as well as the Dancing Lion from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion, and a field boss version of the Gladius Nightlord.</p>
<p>Then there are the new playable characters. The first is the Scholar, an academic with impressive arcane levels who "gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation". The other is the Undertaker, an abbess with strength and faith skills who "sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency". There's also a new Shifting Earth event called The Great Hollow, featuring exotic temples, the remains of an ancient people, and crystals exuding a cursed life-draining miasma - it looks similar to the Ancient Ruins of Rauh from Shadow of the Erdtree. And who are those holy knights with golden spears?</p>

            <p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is getting another closed beta, this time with two new stages as well as Ghost Rider and Spider-Man playable. It'll be available starting the 5th of December, and will run interrupted for 72-hours.</p>
<p>To participate in this beta, eager players will have to sign up at the PlayStation beta website just like in the first closed beta test. This closed beta test will also feature the lobby system, which will allow beta testers to run around a large social space between matches.</p>
<p>In the new gameplay trailer released alongside the beta announced, we see both Ghost Rider and Spider-Man in-action, including a few glimpses at special moves and super attacks which are awfully tantalising. You can watch the announcement yourself below!</p>

<p>This appears to be a similar build to what was playable at Evo France, though that public build was limited only to the two new characters. The uninterrupted nature of this second beta test may seem an odd note, but that's because the first closed beta was broken up into separate testing periods.</p><p>This proved to be a major point of frustration for early players, and so it seems as though Arc System Works and Sony has listened to feedback and provided an opportunity for eager fighting game fans to really grind the game out next month.</p>
<p>If you fancy it, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">Eurogamer's Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls preview</a> here for an idea of what the game is like, and whether or not you should be excited. In it, the game is described as: "a visual carnival, a celebration of comic books, movement, and wall-to-wall action".</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/gran-turismo-7-power-pack-adds-24-hour-races-alongside-spec-iii-update/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kaznori Yamauchi made a brief appearance during the State of Play Japan stream with a key announcement for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>. With the GT7 Spec III coming out on 4th December, Polyphony Digital has also prepared a new Power Pack DLC to go alongside.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gran Turismo 7 - Power Pack Add-On Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkAuyjsfmuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack is a premium DLC that’s all about bringing fully fledged endurance racing to the popular sim racer for the first time.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big bundle, which will include in its bundle of content:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 new races across 20 themed categories, inspired by global automotive and motorsport traditions.</li>
<li>24-hour endurance racing for players who crave the ultimate test of skill and stamina.</li>
<li>Full race weekends: Practice, qualify, and compete in the main event for a true racing simulation.</li>
<li>Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0 AI for intense, tail-to-nose battles that push your limits.</li>
<li>Includes 5,000,000 in-game Credits</li>
</ul>
<p>This is really for the endurance racing lovers, with a wide array of races that will include country-inspired circuits and some of the most legendary endurance racing events – the 24hrs of Le Mans no doubt included in that, but I’m hoping for a 24hr of Lemons event as well.. Gran Turismo Sophy 3.0 will aim to offer the most taxing AI racing challenge and competition possible through this.</p>

<p>While the Spec 3 update will be free for all players of GT7, the Power Pack will be paid DLC. Pricing has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that full-on 24-hour races have featured as part of a Gran Turismo game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/11/24/review-gran-turismo-5/">GT5</a> you could race a full 24 hour race yourself, and put your B-Spec AI drivers into the mixer for some progression while you’re not actively playing the game, but endurance racing provides different challenges for the racing AI, pit stop strategies and more.</p>
<p>Of course, we’d have loved to have seen longer form racing included in GT7 from the off – it’s often a bit of an afterthought, given the demands i puts on both players, game designers, and testers – but Polyphony should be credited with consistently updating and expanding their games with free content, new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Spec 3 will be a big update for the 2022 racer, with the following new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 new tracks (Yas Marina Circuit, Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve)</li>
<li>8 new cars</li>
<li>‘Dunlop’ tyres</li>
<li>Data Logger</li>
<li>Collector Level cap increased</li>
<li>Unlimited car invitations in Brand Central</li>
<li>Enhanced Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>New opening movie</li>
<li>New Menu Book ‘Seasonal Menu’</li>
<li>New events in ‘Circuit Experience’</li>
<li>New Curations in ‘Scapes’</li>
<li>Improvements to online races</li>
</ul>

<p>The remake of this horror classic will, of course, bring enhanced visuals, as well as some gameplay tweaks, so you can now have greater control of the integral camera in the game, able to zoom and focus with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As one of the big announcements to kick off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event,</a> Koei Tecmo announced that Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake, a remake of the classic entry into the Fatal Frame franchise, will arrive on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch 2 this coming March 12, 2026.</p>



<p>A new trailer for the remake was showcased during the live stream event, which concluded with a reveal of the game's release date. It's the latest re-release in the Fatal Frame series after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/fatal-frame-mask-of-the-lunar-eclipse-release-date/"> remaster for Fatal Frame: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>.</p>



<p>A post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/fatal-frame-ii-crimson-butterfly-remake-launches-march-12/">PlayStation Blog</a> that went live shortly after the trailer premiered delved into the main characters in the game and an overview of the game's story, but unfortunately did not go into too much detail about what is being upgraded in this remake. </p>



<p>"<em>Every element has been enhanced — from graphics and sound to controls. The texture of each character’s skin and clothing has been meticulously refined, while the setting of Minakami Village has been beautifully reimagined with striking contrasts of light and shadow to create an atmosphere that is both haunting and lifelike</em>," writes Makoto Shibata, director of the Fatal Frame series at Koei Tecmo.</p>

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in late October</a>, Bethesda released Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition yesterday for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X, as a way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original launch. </p>



<p>This new version of the critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic open world roleplaying game includes all the six official DLCs released by Bethesda Game Studios (Far Harbor, Automatron, Nuka-World, Contraptions Workshop, Vault-Tec Workshop and Wasteland Workshop), as well as over 150 Creation Club items, including new quests, companions, armors, weapons, skins, player homes, and objects to add to the Settlements system. Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, which will launch next year for Nintendo Switch 2, is priced at $59.99 for new users, $39.99 for those upgrading from the original game, and $19.99 for those upgrading from the Game of the Year edition.</p>

<p>However, just like with <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> four years ago, this new edition breaks many essential mods that users had based their modlists around. The main reason is that F4SE, the equivalent of SKSE, an extender upon which many mods are based, no longer works (until its creators update it).</p>



<p>And just like with Skyrim Anniversary Edition, modders have quickly come up with a method to revert Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition to the previous version of the game (v1.10.984), thus preventing the breaking of your precious mods.</p>



<p>The first to post a guide on how to do that was Nexus Mods user ocramuias (in the comments section of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this page</a>). Here's an abridged version of that guide:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the Steam console by pressing Win + R and pasting <strong>steam://open/console</strong></li>



<li>Run the following command inside the Steam console: <strong>download_depot 377160 377162 5698952341602575696</strong></li>



<li>This forces Steam to download the Fallout4.exe file (38 MB in size) from the previous build, version 1.10.984, which was originally released on May 13, 2024. When the download is complete, open the folder shown in the console log. This can usually be found in <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\content\app_377160\depot_377162</strong></li>



<li>Once there, you must back up your current executable. Navigate to your game's installation directory (for example, <strong>C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout 4</strong>), and rename the existing Fallout4.exe to Fallout4_111137.exe. Now, copy the previously downloaded file into that folder and replace the existing .exe file.</li>



<li>At this point, it's time to disable automatic updates for Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition. You can do that in Steam &gt; Library &gt; Fallout 4 &gt; Properties &gt; Updates &gt; set "Only update this game when I launch it". From now on, you'll always have to launch the game through <strong>f4se_loader.exe</strong> rather than Steam.</li>



<li>Also, set Fallout4.exe to Read-only by right-clicking with the mouse and going to Properties. This will prevent Steam from overwriting it.</li>
</ol>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

              <p>A highly advanced AI-powered robot took a tumble in Russia during a technology presentation. Unfortunately for the robot and its creators, the fall happened while the <em>Rocky</em> theme song played, and it was all recorded and shared online.</p> <p>On November 11, <a href="https://unn.ua/en/news/in-russia-the-first-humanoid-robot-fell-at-a-presentation-it-was-covered-from-the-audience">AIdol showcased some AI-powered autonomous robots</a> at the Yarovit Hall Congress Center in Moscow. <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">Photos from the event</a> posted by the <em>Moscow City News Agency</em> show that the company had a few different robots on hand for the event, letting people get up close to them, take selfies, and <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063641">even kiss the creepy-looking bots</a>.</p>

 <p>However, at some point during the event, one of the robots was presented on stage and began to walk like someone who had had one too many drinks. Just a few moments later, <a href="https://www.mskagency.ru/photobank/1063636">the bot crashed forward</a> onto the floor, leaving broken bits of plastic and metal on the ground. After the fall, someone tried to use a black curtain to cover up what had happened, but the curtain was twisted up, and it took far too long to hide the situation. While all of this happened, inexplicably, it sounds like the <em>Rocky</em> theme song was playing in the background.

This is top-tier comedy. In fact, it was so funny that I wasn’t sure it was real. I mean, there was that <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/12/13/hi-tech-robot-on-russian-state-tv-turns-out-to-be-a-fraud/">fake robot back in 2018</a> in Russia that turned out to be a man in a suit. Perhaps this was fake, too? But looking around, it does seem like this event happened and was covered by a news agency in Moscow.&nbsp; This is all a bit embarrassing for the folks involved, but at least the robot never stepped on a Lego and <a href="https://b1.mskagency.ru/c/1119897.jpg">screamed in pain…oh no!</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155047/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>In 2021, publisher Skybound Games put out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a> on PC and Mac (later on mobile and PSVR2), which offered an innovative control mechanic in which you primarily interacted with the game through eye movement and blinks. Alongside this cool gimmick, Before Your Eyes was lauded for its gripping emotional story, quickly turning it into an indie favourite that garnered a passionate following.</p>
<p>Now, the developers at GoodbyeWorld Games have created a spiritual sequel called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, which both builds on some of the themes of its predecessor and introduces some cool ideas of its own. Though it currently lacks the eye control feature on Switch 2 (a Camera update is planned "sometime after launch"), it still proves a worthwhile narrative experience.</p>
<p>Goodnight Universe places you in the role of Isaac, an infant with the mind of a grown man and psychic powers, born to an unremarkable and ordinary nuclear family. Isaac can babble and cry and do all the things that a normal baby can do, but every now and then he causes a little chaos by flexing his psionic abilities in ways that confuse, frighten, and delight those around him who haven’t caught on and believe that Isaac is simply just a ‘normal’ baby.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160467/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet there’s, of course, the lingering mystery of <em>why</em> Isaac can do these things, and the plot naturally thickens once he catches the attention of the Aio Corporation, a tech company which seems to have some understanding of Isaac’s powers and has its own agenda for how to utilise them.</p>
<p>While the twists throughout the relatively brief (~four-hour) narrative are certainly intriguing, this is ultimately a soulful and heartwarming tale about the importance of family and the finite nature of time. As Isaac narrates his experience, you’re getting a first-row seat to all the ups and downs of ordinary family life, and not all of it is pretty.</p>
<p>In one instance, you’re witnessing a wholesome interaction between Isaac’s sister, Cleo, and his dad, while in another you’re tuning in to his dad’s private thoughts while he reads a bedtime story and learning of various insecurities and concerns he struggles with as the family's main provider. Domestic life can be messy in so many beautiful ways, and Goodnight Universe does a great job of showcasing this while keeping things interesting with the goofy antics of its primary protagonist.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160470/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are some key moments in which you can express yourself and choose <em>slightly</em> diverging routes for a given scene, this is a largely linear tale that plays out somewhat like an interactive Pixar movie. Every now and then, you’ll get to choose something — such as whether Isaac responds with happiness or sadness to what another character said or did — and this leads to a few unique lines of dialogue, but there aren’t any bigger moments that lead to completely separate paths and different routes.</p>
<p>Some may be disappointed by this, but I appreciated the single-minded nature of the narrative, as it allows you to more easily immerse yourself, rather than keep stepping out to determine which route might be more interesting.</p>
<p>Gameplay follows the structure of a simple point-and-click adventure game in which you primarily scan the environment for the next interactable object or person needed to move the scene forward. Sometimes you’re given a neat checklist to follow with multiple objectives, while others you must intuit what’s next based on what the characters are doing.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160475/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Isaac can read minds and manipulate objects from afar, leading to all sorts of mischief as you innocently poke and prod at the world, leaving those around you bewildered as dishes seemingly wash themselves and toys aren’t found in the same places they were left.</p>
<p>There are some light puzzles to solve every now and then, but progression is basically a matter of identifying the correct object you need to manipulate in the environment and then doing the action needed to make it move or dance or fly across the room.</p>
<p>You do gain a few new abilities as the narrative progresses and Isaac gets more of a handle on his powers, but it’s very rare that the path forward isn’t made obvious either by the game literally telling you what to do next or very strongly hinting at it. Those of you who are looking for challenge won’t find it here, then, but the gameplay isn’t so braindead that you disengage.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155048/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Just like Before Your Eyes, the controls for Goodnight Universe feel designed around eye-tracking software for video cameras, but... well, the Switch 2 version doesn’t support this at launch. As a result, you’re left to navigate the interface using the right stick to move the cursor and camera, which often feels more tedious than I’d like. It’s the sort of control scheme that’s <em>fine,</em> but it feels clunky and unintuitive, which tends to take you out of the narrative that’s clearly trying to place you in Isaac’s shoes.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that stick controls are a dealbreaker, it’s nonetheless worth keeping in mind that you’re missing out on a key component of the intended game experience when playing it on console before the planned update arrives.</p>
<p>Visually, Goodnight Universe employs a simplistic but charming art style that leans well into the cartoonish absurdity of its protagonist’s abilities. The exaggerated proportions and environments vaguely call to mind the art style of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari</a> series, but there’s plenty of room for detailed character expression and smooth animation as scenes play out. Naturally, all this unfolds without any frame hitches or skips, highlighting the much-welcomed power boost that the Switch 2 hardware brings over its predecessor.</p>
<figure><a title="Goodnight Universe Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160477/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as the audio is concerned, music is sparsely utilized to punctuate scenes and elevate the atmosphere, often adhering to tracks that lean into the whimsy and sci-fi elements of the story. The music takes the backseat, however, to make room for the excellent voice acting, which significantly adds to the overall experience.</p>
<p>Not only are all the performances passionate and nuanced, but little details in the sound mixing contribute lots to the immersion, such as when listening to a character’s thoughts and hearing their internal monologue come at you from different ‘directions’. At boot up, you’re encouraged to play this game with headphones and I couldn’t agree more; the soundscape here is something you’ll want to pay lots of attention to.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Goodnight Universe is an enjoyable and quirky narrative adventure game that feels like a satisfying follow-up to the deeply emotional experience of Before Your Eyes. Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment.</p>
<p>The only major drawback here is that the Switch 2 doesn’t support the eye and face tracking control style of the PC version at launch, which notably does take away somewhat from the core experience. All the same, I’d suggest you pick up Goodnight Universe if this one has already caught your eye. It provides a memorable narrative journey and is the sort of game that you’ll still be thinking about long after putting it down.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>NetEase is set to debut the fifth season of Marvel Rivals this coming Friday, November 14, 2025, and ahead of that launch, it released a new cinematic trailer showcasing the two new roster additions for Season 5, Gambit and Rogue. Also, as usual, NetEase released a Dev Vision video, which delved deeper into the changes coming in Season 5, including the introduction of a new Conquest mode.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Love is a Battlefield | Marvel Rivals Season 5 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXOUHb64164?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gambit will be the first new hero added to the roster starting on Friday, and he joins the roster as a Strategist, who can use his powers to heal allies, get rid of negative effects on allies, and also do damage against enemies while applying an anti-heal effect.</p>



<p>Season 5 also adds a new map set in New York's Times Square, but unlike other maps in Marvel Rivals, it is a non-combat map dedicated to letting players socialize and do whatever they like instead of always jumping into competitive modes.</p>



<p>Speaking of those competitive modes, the other introduction in this season is the new Conquest (Annihilation) mode. An 18v18 mode that unfortunately does not go live this Friday, but will be live during Season 5 on November 27, 2025.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>This is all just what NetEase has to show off for Season 5 so far, since under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/">new seasonal structure it instituted starting with Season 3</a>, each season is broken up into two halves, with one hero added to the roster in each half. So if you're looking for more from NetEase, there is more to come, you just have to wait a little longer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hades-2-story-melinoe-chronos-hecate-is-it-good-2000642943</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-ii-isn%E2%80%99t-a-story%E2%80%94it%E2%80%99s-maintenance.1350346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I lose again in </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Damn.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I wake up in the same dim corner of the Crossroads, staring at the same painting. Melinoë as a baby, held by her mother Persephone. Her brother Zagreus beside them. Hades smiling down, the whole family together with the serenity of a dream you wake up forgetting.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The game gives me one prompt: “Brood.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I press it, Melinoë scoffs, </span><i><span>“You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>Another scripted moment no one will remember, lost to the churn of repetition. Brood, indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s pretty much all of </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>: a game that repeats forever without ever meaning something more than what’s said the first time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Melinoë says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” Hecate says.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Death to Chronos,” I say.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Chronos is the enemy. Chronos must die. It’s a setup that sounds rich with mythic potential—time itself is the tyrant that must be slain—but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>never seems interested in asking what this devotion might cost its protagonist. Melinoë isn’t a character enduring a story; she’s a weapon driving it forward until the moment when the story finally surrenders.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><em><strong>This piece contains major spoilers for the story of&nbsp;</strong></em><strong>Hades II.</strong></p> <figure id="attachment_2000614569" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614569"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614569"><br><!--EndFragment --></figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, the structure of <em>Hades II</em> seems built for that interrogation. Like its predecessor, it’s a roguelike: death, rebirth, progress through repetition. A form that practically begs for introspection. Each failure could have been an opportunity to reveal more of Melinoë’s interior life. We could question what “Death to Chronos” even means to her. And yet the game never bothers, never earns her conviction. It takes her belief as a given and never really interrogates the ache that made her say it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is what writers call a failure of scaffolding.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Zagreus was a protagonist positioned perfectly within the roguelike form. Every run was a teenager sneaking out of the house against his father’s wishes, even though they both knew he would have to come back eventually. Zagreus, like so many teenagers, wanted more, wanted to push up against the limits of possibility, maybe push beyond them, to make things different than they are. And so often he has his hopes dashed, his yearning unfulfilled.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>, by contrast, trades that ache for a slogan. Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos, Death to Chronos. The game is full of endless divine chatter that fills the stretches of silence between combat runs, but the world never gets any deeper. Hours of dialogue evaporate as soon as they’re read; nothing sticks. Worse, nothing scars.</span></p>

  <p><span>By the end, the plot resolves neatly enough. Melinoë finally defeats Chronos, but instead of killing him, she sends a message to Zagreus in the past: reach out to him, forgive him, bring him back into the family. Zagreus does. History rewrites itself. Everyone remembers two timelines—one where Chronos was cruel and one where he was kind—and they choose to believe the gentler one. Melinoë gains not only the family in the painting but also the grandfather she was trained to destroy. Then, without fanfare, she sets off to repeat the cycle in “other timelines.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s clean. Complete. A conclusion stated instead of learned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is a Rites of Passage story that forgets to include the passage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A Rites of Passage story</span><i><span>, </span></i><span>for the uninitiated, always begins with a life problem—something unavoidable and existential. Growing up, forgiving, grieving, learning how to stay. The wrong way to face it is denial; the right way is acceptance. The beauty of the genre lies in watching someone resist change until they can’t anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If we consider another story in this genre, like Judy Blume’s widely beloved 1970 novel </span><i><span>Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret</span></i><span>, we can better understand </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>. Margaret’s life problem is becoming herself. She is learning what it means to inhabit a changing body, a changing faith, and a changing world. Her wrong way is through control. She prays for time to move faster, for life to just happen already. The hard truth she must accept is that time will go on with or without her permission.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, in Stephen Chbosky’s </span><i><span>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</span></i><span>, Charlie’s life problem is trauma. His wrong way is silence—the belief that not remembering will keep him safe. His catharsis comes when he finally recalls the truth and survives it. Both stories build empathy through resistance. We ache as their denial collapses because we’ve been with them through the denial.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628068">©</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>has the same ingredients but none of the impact. Melinoë’s life problem is being born into revenge. Her wrong way is living by it. Her hard truth is that forgiveness ends the cycle. But the game skips the middle act. Where is the resistance? Melinoë never fails because of her flaw. Her vengeance doesn’t cost her anything. No friends lost, no cracks in her resolve, no moment where the loop itself becomes unbearable. She doubts only in fleeting dialogue, never in action. Her transformation happens underneath a run of combat indistinguishable from the last.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Without the wrong way, there’s no reason to crave the right one.</span></p> <p><span>The roguelike loop doesn’t stall Melinoë’s growth. It always rewards her for embracing it. Every run makes her faster, or stronger, or more resilient. “Death to Chronos” is not a curse, but an endless battery. The game trains us to believe and give into what it should have taught us to question: Death to Chronos.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There’s one moment that could have broken the pattern. Late in the game, Melinoë learns that her mentor, Hecate, is an older version of herself—a Melinoë from another timeline who succeeded in killing Chronos but lost herself in the process. Her personhood sanded down until she’s just the witch who trains the next one.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The two speak in soft circles. There has never been meaningful friction between them and there won’t be today. Melinoë insists, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>You are my mother.</span><i><span>” </span></i><span>Hecate replies, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>I am not</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>When it’s over, they agree, </span><i><span>“</span></i><span>Let’s pretend none of this transpired</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>And nothing changes. Melinoë loves her just the same. The revelation is a gift to the audience, not the character. We’re handed a twist, a piece of trivia, not a destabilizing truth. I feel nothing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Are we meant to believe the passage occurs here? That painful transformation is proven by one version of Melinoë living on under another name, sustained only by this timeline’s necessity? This version, like our unyielding allegiance to “Death to Chronos,” exists not to change the story, but to make its ending possible. Hecate had to be here. She is the proof of what the game can’t admit—that something must break for time to move forward, but </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>refuses to break </span><i><span>our </span></i><span>Melinoë at all.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>is afraid of its own premise. A Rites of Passage story demands stillness, loss, change, and this roguelike cannot abide. The game talks about ending cycles while mechanically refusing to stop spinning.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>When I play, the only emotions I feel belong to the combat: the thrill of a build working out just how I imagined, the delight of a particularly rare boon appearing when I need it, the visceral pleasure of clearing a room without ever being touched. When the credits eventually roll, I’ve learned nothing. I haven’t learned anything about Melinoë, or about myself, or about existence. Zagreus saves Chronos, everyone remembers a better time, and Melinoë sets off to fix other timelines. </span><i><span>Hades II </span></i><span>isn’t a story. It’s maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So I wake up again, in that corner of the Crossroads, and stare at the painting. Melinoë, the not-yet-formed person she was. The family she was promised.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“</span></i><span>You don’t remember them, besides this painting and your dreams. But still you fight for them…</span><i><span>”&nbsp;</span></i></p> <p><span>After brooding for too long, she sometimes covers the painting with a cloth. I understand now. Some dreams stop meaning something the moment you wake up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop has sparked shock and anger among Warhammer 40,000 fans after it killed off two main characters from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> via a brief lore update posted on its website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">Games Workshop announced that Titus, the main playable character from last year’s blockbuster hit video game Space Marine 2, had been promoted with a cool new trailer that set up the next narrative expansion for the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>, dubbed 500 Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Captain Demetrian Titus, Master of the Watch, is now once again Captain of the Ultramarines Second Company, a position he had already held before he was taken into custody on suspicion of heresy by the Inquisition after the events of the first Space Marine game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Titus’ promotion, fans had expressed concern over the fate of Sevastus Acheran, the former captain of the Second Company and Master of the Watch who dishes out missions (and can never spare enough men) in Space Marine 2. Now we know what actually happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a lore update post on <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/2uwxtd2k/500-worlds-how-did-titus-become-captain-of-the-second-company-again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Community</a>, Games Workshop revealed what Acheran got up to following the events of Space Marine 2. And yes, as fans feared, he’s dead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from a four paragraph lore explanation in the article itself, which reveals Acheran went out in a blaze of glory fighting a Genestealer Cult on the hive world of Trygg. That’s that. Acheran is dead. But it gets worse.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/40k-secondcoycaptains-nov11-image5-ntfnir5ucc-1762888578681.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sevastus Acheran is dead. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out Lieutenant Chairon, one of Titus’ squadmates from Space Marine 2 and who was conspicuous by his absence from Games Workshop’s Titus reveal, was by Acheran’s side and also died at the hands of the Genestealer Cult. Chairon doesn't even get more than a shout out, despite being the more prominent character in Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it went down:</p><blockquote>Every last Space Marine that landed on Trygg was slowly worn down in a series of increasingly desperate battles. When Imperial reinforcements arrived to purge the last of the cult, they discovered that Acheran, Chairon, and the rest of their brothers had sold their lives to cull untold numbers of xenos hybrids.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Warhammer 40,000 fans are a tad upset not just <em>by</em> the news of the characters’ deaths, but <em>how</em> Games Workshop revealed the news. Many are saying Acheran and Chairon deserved better than to be killed off-screen, and should instead have got their moment in either Space Marine 2 DLC or the confirmed Space Marine 3. At the very least, the characters could have been dealt with in a short story or, better still, a Warhammer 40,000 novel. But no. All they get is a few pars in a Warhammer Community article most fans won’t even read.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">F's in the chat for the GOAT Chairon (and Acheran too I guess) <a href="https://t.co/wY0C1ags0L" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/wY0C1ags0L</a></p>— Master of Machines 🚧 (@MachDominus) <a href="https://twitter.com/MachDominus/status/1988269547271414241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"They had so much options," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1oubpkp/comment/noanrqq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Fit_Fisherman_9840</a> on the Space Marine subreddit, which is currently up in arms. "Make Chairon the new LT, or since his hate for the traitor make him the company Judiciar. And Acheran? Make it a dreadnought for f*** sake."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What a bummer about Acheran and Chairon," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1oubixc/comment/noah3qc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said Thinsul over on the Warhammer 40,000 subreddit</a>. "Killing them both off screen, especially Chairon as a Primaris that was born during the Heresy, is really low. It should have happened in a DLC or maybe a animation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He died as he lived, unable to spare any more men," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/1oucaor/comment/noamd38/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaker_person said</a> of Acheran's demise on the 40kLore subreddit. "Is there anything more grimdark than to die offscreen?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1oubixc/comment/noamax5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked ChaoticMat</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And what does this all mean for the other Ultramarines in Space Marine 2? Are they dead, too? In particular, fans are wondering about Chaplain Leandros, who was not mentioned as being among the dead alongside Acheran and Chairon. Perhaps he’s still out there somewhere, casting an inquisitive eye on Titus as he tries desperately to reclaim Ultramar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this probably feeds into Space Marine 3 in some way, assuming the sequel picks up after the events of 500 Worlds or takes place during them. We know next to nothing about the game, but we can probably count poor Acheran and Chairon out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Kicking off later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, it really is here — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, the soccer RPG from Level-5 which has seen multiple delays and <em>two</em> name changes, finally launches on 13th November 2025 on Switch and Switch 2. And ahead of that day, the developer has shared the first 30 minutes of the game's story mode.</p>
<p>The footage (above) is from the game's Story Mode, and as you can see, it's <em>very</em> story-heavy. There's not even any footie. But there's plenty to do as you explore the grounds of the school for the very first time.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the early highlights are the gorgeous animated cutscenes from MAPPA, the animation studio best known for its work on <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> Season 4, <strong>Vinland Saga</strong> Season 2, and <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.</p>
<p>You might have seen that some people are already playing the game online; that's because pre-orders for the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions of the game grant Early Access to the game. That's <em>not</em> the case on Switch 1 or 2, unfortunately. So we'll have to wait until Thursday for a kickabout...</p>

<p>You might also be wondering about official reviews, too. We'll echo the words our sister site Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/site-news-wheres-our-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-ps5-ps4-review">shared yesterday</a>: we don't have a pre-release code.</p>
<p>And, as we'll be reviewing the Switch 2 version — which has Mouse Mode, along with better performance and visuals and other features — we also don't have access to... early access, so we won't be able to make a start until we get a code or until the game's officially out.</p>
<p>So, basically, we'll have a review for you as soon as we can, but as you're likely aware, this game is <em>massive</em>.</p>
