		<p>It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/09/greedfall-review/">Greedfall</a>. When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 |  2nd Major Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPhs61akKWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience.</p>


<p>The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land.</p>


<p>This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up.</p>
<p>The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment.</p>

<p>The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take.</p>
<p>The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops.</p>

<p>All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Action games have been in a remarkably strong position for several years now. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">While standout surprises and new hits defined 2024</strong></a>, 2025 felt like the year when many of the genre’s most anticipated projects finally released. It was also the year when legendary franchises finally returned, and established formulas were refined to greater polish.</p>



<p>With so many great action games coming out in the past 12 months, deciding which five should be considered the best wasn't an easy task. However, our top picks have that little something that puts them above every other game, making them a must-play for all fans of the genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-8-7">Ninja Gaiden 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">8.7</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ninja-Gaiden-4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 is an excellent return for the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After having been on hiatus for many years, and with Team NINJA focusing on action RPGs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh series</strong></a>, it seemed like the Ninja Gaiden franchise was done. However, 2025 proved that this wasn't the case. One of the premier character action series is not only alive, but is also doing very, very well.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is notable not only for bringing back the franchise but for being the result of a collaboration between PlatinumGames and Team NINJA, a dream collaboration for all fans of the genre. And while some of the typical PlatinumGames gameplay mechanics may have diluted what hardcore Ryu Hayabusa fans believe is the real Ninja Gaiden, the game is undoubtedly one of the best action games of the year, and a great title to celebrate the legacy of Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away this year.</strong></a></p>



<p>Kai Tatsumoto highlighted well the game's strengths and minor flaws, saying in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Some of PlatinumGames' best character action to date is muddled with a bloated first half and an otherwise uninteresting protagonist. However, as the narrative picks up, this ninja doesn't stop until long after the credits roll.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-8-5">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/">8.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The long wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was well worth it</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced so long ago</a></strong> that the many years of silence made most fans of the series lose hope that the game would ever be released. The little information that filtered through the grapevine wasn't very promising either, but the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">eventual return of Retro Studios to the franchise</a></strong> provided that little spark of hope fans needed.</p>



<p>In 2025, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launched, and it met expectations, for the most part. While the story is a little forgettable, and its conclusion a little flat, the game does well everything that makes the series what it is: great level design, engaging combat, and a fantastic atmosphere powered by some of the best visuals seen on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In his review, Nathan Birch highlighted how these elements come together to offer a compelling experience that is just a little short of excellence: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. </em></p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yōtei (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei enhances the foundation of its predecessor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei had some rather big shoes to fill this year. Despite not innovating open-world games significantly, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ghost of Tsushima delivered a very engaging experience</strong></a>, with protagonist Jin Sakai's struggles to maintain a shred of samurai honor as he battled the Mongols out of Tsushima being the absolute highlight.</p>



<p>Although the story may not be as engaging for those seeking total historical accuracy, Ghost of Yōtei has refined its predecessor's experience to deliver yet another engaging open-world experience. With improved gameplay expanding both combat and exploration, which moves away from the waymarker-filled approach of its predecessor, spectacular boss fights and striking visuals, the second entry in the series is a game worth experiencing for all fans of the series.</p>



<p>Alessio Palumbo put it well how Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to its predecessor in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-9-0">The First Berserker: Khazan (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">9.0</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-First-Berserker-Khazan.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The First Berserker: Khazan provides an excellent action game experience with an intricate web of deep mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan made a few head turns when <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-is-a-single-player-action-rpg-based-in-the-dnf-universe/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it was announced in 2023</strong></a> with its great-looking cel-shaded visuals and charismatic protagonist voiced by Ben Starr (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy XVI</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>). The prospect of another soulslike in 2025 did not make many too excited about it, but the game developed by Neople surpassed all expectations.</p>



<p>More than a soulslike inspired by FromSoftware games, The First Berserker: Khazan is more akin to an action game developed by Team NINJA, sporting a web of interconnected gameplay mechanics enhanced by a deep loot system that makes the game's high-speed, high-intensity combat even more engaging.</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of Team NINJA, I couldn't help but enjoy The First Berserker: Khazan<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> </strong>a lot, as I highlighted in my review:<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "With its excellent combat system, complementary mechanics, solid level and enemy design, and engaging story, The First Berserker: Khazan stands out as one of the best action RPGs in recent years.</em>"</p>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from KONAMI, the Metal Gear series seemed all but done. However, Naked Snake stealthed his way onto modern-day gaming hardware with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of the beloved third entry in the series.</p>



<p>In an era where remakes usually change much of the games they are based on, with mixed results, KONAMI opted to be as faithful as possible to Hideo Kojima's creation, introducing only <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a slew of gameplay improvements that enhance the experience</strong></a> while offering players the chance to experience the game mostly as it was via the Legacy Style controls. And while something more could have been done to modernize the experience, the developer's choices proved to be the right ones.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"KONAMI</em><em> </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on,"</em> said Kai Tatsumoto in his review</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

			<p>If you could turn the clocks back a week from today, you'd return to a world where no one (at least publicly) was hurling vitriol and hate towards Larian Studios. Everyone was actually quite excited about what the studio had coming, since it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">just announced a new Divinity game</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, which was inarguably one of the biggest announcements of the night.</p>



<p>In the week since that reveal, things have looked quite different from Larian, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">after an interview with Bloomberg (and several other outlets)</a> with Larian's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, revealed that Larian Studios was using generative AI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity. That admittance was the reason players criticized and chastised Larian Studios online, and the reason behind the recent stir of discussion of generative AI use in game development.</p>



<p>Vincke has since<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/"> responded to the backlash with a more formal statement sent to IGN and a less-formal statement posted to his account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he exclaimed, "<em>Holy f*** guys,</em> <em>we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</em>."</p>



<p>Amidst the backlash, former developers who worked at Larian also stood up to comment on what the introduction of GenAI tech did for their experience working at the studio. Game writers and narrative designers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">also stood up to call out Larian for its poor hiring practices</a>, taking the chance to voice concerns they had held for some time, but refrained from speaking out against for fear of burning future professional opportunities and/or out of respect for the writers still working at Larian.</p>



<p>On the other side, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian,</a> saying, <em>"</em><em>Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in what appears to be a final statement on the issue for 2025, Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">took to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account to speak on the matter</a> once again.</p>



<p>"<em>It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation</em>," Vincke began. "<em>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make."</em></p>



<p>"<em>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Vincke goes on to say that the company will host an AMA event in the new year, giving those with concerns over Larian Studios using generative AI technology the chance to directly ask the studio whatever they want. No doubt that Vincke and he rest of the team at Larian would also hope that the AMA will be where they can explain themselves in a way that quells the vitriol we've seen towards Larian this past week.</p>



<p>For additional context, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who authored the interview with Vincke that started this whole controversy, shared the rough, unedited transcript of his conversation with Vincke. You can read it below.</p>

			<p>[<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UPDATE - December 19, 10:23 AM</strong>] Though an official confirmation has yet to be provided, it's all but confirmed that more Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge options are being offered to publishers. According to ININ Games, two new, smaller cartridge sizes were announced this week by Nintendo, allowing the publisher to release R-Type Dimensions III on a physical cartridge in Europe.</p>



<p>The downside is that the price of the game will increase by 10€, essentially confirming that some publishers will still prefer using Game-Key Cards to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Original story follows.</p>



<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this year was accompanied by a radical change for retail releases with the Game-Key cards, which essentially act as a bridge between a retail and a digital release, requiring users to download the full game on their systems to play it using said cards as a sort of access license.</p>



<p>Although the community has been very vocal about their dislike about these releases for justifiable reasons, it seems like Game-Key Cards are here to stay, even with Nintendo attempting to address the issue that made many developers pick this format over a traditional cartdrige.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag/post/3ma6x4jlgkk2u?ref_src=embed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendeal on Bluesky</strong></a>, the Japanese company is seemingly producing smaller-capacity Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges that would allow more developers to publish proper retail releases of their games.</p>



<p><em>"Due to chip shortages it will take time before we see widespread availability,"</em> Nintendeal added, but this won't be the only reason why it may be more time until more Switch 2 games receive traditional retail releases. <em>"Despite the smaller capacity, these cards will still be expensive due to rising cost of materials,"</em> the user continued, predicting that <em>"Game-Key Cards are not going away."</em></p>



<p>The widespread use of Game-Key Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 games' retail releases is reportedly caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/"><strong>physical cartridges coming with a single 64 GB option</strong></a>, which could be too expensive for games coming in smaller sizes and are simply not enough for larger games. </p>



<p>Nintendo's reported decision to produce <span>smaller-capacity cartridges is definitely a step in the right direction, but under the current circumstances, developers may continue to prefer using Game-Key cards to keep costs down and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-are-necessary-to-overcome-cartridge-limitations-ffvii-rebirth-director-says/" target="_blank"><strong>overcome some technical limitations</strong></a>, to the disappointment of every fan of physical game releases</span>.</p>

              <p>A great pair of headphones can change the way you enjoy your favorite media. You can drop a lot of cash on one, but you need to make sure you get a brand that can actually deliver. And you’ll also want to find some that you won’t have to spend an arm and a leg on. We found some great Sony headphones that are not only discounted, but they’re lightweight, cushioned, and built to fit well for long listening sessions. And best of all, you can get them on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6523/">The Sony ULT WEAR Over-Ear Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones are up over at Amazon for just $148, down from their usual price of $250.</a> That’s a discount of $102 and 41% off.

<h2>Comfortable headphones perfect for just about any use case</h2>
<p>These headphones are prided on how comfortable they feel. The ear cups offer extremely soft padding so you can wear them for hours without discomfort. If you’re used to earbuds that can sometimes pinch the insides of your ears, that could be a major game-changer. The headband is adjustable too, so you can find a fit that feels right for you.

Don’t miss out and snag the deal while you still can.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Discounted by 50% Just One Month After Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/</link>
            <guid>1388383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 did not land well with fans. It emerged amidst a <strong>packed </strong>schedule that included titans like ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6, a fact that might have hindered the game’s success beyond all belief. It doesn’t help that the campaign was seen as lacklustre, and the multiplayer platform isn’t what most fans were clamouring for.</p>



<p>In what seems like a bout of recognition of the poor review scores and lack of hype around the latest Call of Duty title, Best Buy has slashed the price. Right now, for one day only, you can get Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for just <strong>$34.99</strong>, barely five weeks after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-mighty-are-falling">The Mighty Are Falling</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has been on a generational run of bad luck of late. Last year’s Black Ops 6 was pretty good, but the success found at launch tailed off very quickly. It proved to be a good year across the board for activations and the game’s esports scene, but the series floundered hard and continues to do so, with this year’s release.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 just didn’t hit the mark with fans. It fell short in early reviews and managed to dredge up a Metascore of just 67, with a woeful user rating on the same platform of just 1.6. Those are some of the lowest numbers <strong>ever achieved </strong>by a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When you align that with the surrounding titles, such as the uber-impressive ARC Raiders and the revitalization of a franchise in Battlefield 6, you paint a clear picture for Activision and Call of Duty.</p>



<p>COD fatigue is alive and well in late 2025.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-already-half-price-at-most-retailers-barely-a-month-after-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> noticed that Best Buy is selling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for <strong>one day only </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-playstation-5/JJGXPXZ5GX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for just $34.99</a>. That’s a 50% discount, but it’s not too far from what other retailers are selling the game for.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>also </strong>only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-g2a-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$35 <strong>right now </strong>on G2A</a>, and that’s not a one-day sale. It’s one of the cheapest places to buy Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Even Activision recently came out and stressed that, going forward, the Call of Duty sub-franchises will not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-back-to-back-releases/">see back-to-back releases</a>. It failed with Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III, and it has now failed again with Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming horror title, OD, asking fans to watch the trailer numerous times just to get a hint of what it is about. </p>



<p>For those curious, OD is the upcoming game from Hideo Kojima, developed for Xbox Game Studios. The only information we have about the title is that it will be a horror game, along with additional hints revealed in the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ teaser earlier this year. However, it appears that the teaser contained more clues than players initially realized.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-a-big-hint-in-od-s-trailer">Hideo Kojima Talks About a ‘Big Hint’ in OD’s Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-says-watch-the-od-teaser-trailer-100-times-and-youll-get-a-big-hint-about-what-his-new-horror-game-actually-is-i-cant-say-anything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about rewatching OD’s trailer for hints. Kojima first talks about the game being unlike any other and how, at first glance, OD looks like horror: “but the system it uses isn’t ordinary.” The game director adds that everything is made in a game engine, but it’s a “system like no other”, which is why they built “a completely new medium together with Microsoft.” </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima then went on to say that he can’t reveal more details about OD, or “Mr Phil will be mad at me.” However, if players “watch the teaser trailer many times there’s a hint.” Kojima will not be able to reveal what it is, but if players “watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer it reads ‘for all players and screamers’. That’s also a big hint.”</p>







<p>In other news, Hideo Kojima isn’t sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether OD will work out</a>. Additionally, the game director has compared AI to smartphones, stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-compares-ai-to-smartphones-says-theres-no-going-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s no going back</a>.

<p>Ultimately, the teaser gives us nothing but a cute little animation, before capping it off with the news. The update will give us a brand new game mode, with more details to come, giving us the perfect opportunity to dive back in next week.</p>
<p>And hey, if you haven't picked up Patapon 1+2 Replay yet, in the UK it's currently on sale for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/PATAPON-1-2-REPLAY-2804105.html"><strong>$19.99 on the eShop</strong></a> (until 31st December).</p>
<p>Releasing back in July of this year, Patapon 1+2 Replay bundles together two iconic PSP rhythm action games where you have to command an army of Patapons by beating drums. The key is timing each of your commands to the beat and knowing when it's best to Don or Pata. If you know, you know.</p>
<p>We had a pleasant time with the Switch version of the game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">scoring it a 7/10</a>: it's "a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Honda Mobility has announced that Afeela will become the world’s first vehicle to introduce PS Remote Play, and it will arrive in California next year. </p>



<p>Yes, cars are being integrated with gaming capabilities over time. We already saw that Xbox Cloud Gaming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/your-car-can-soon-be-an-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to select internet-connected vehicles</a> thanks to a new partnership with LG. Now, Sony Honda Mobility’s first car is ready to arrive with PS Remote Play next year. </p>







<h2 id="h-remotely-use-your-ps5-or-ps4-through-afeela-s-infotainment-system">Remotely Use Your PS5 or PS4 through Afeela’s Infotainment System </h2>



<p>Announced in a new <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Afeela will begin deliveries in California in 2026, becoming the first vehicle with PS Remote Play, allowing users to play their PS5 and PS4 games through the car’s infotainment system. The games are not like cloud gaming; instead, they let players play remotely from their console via the vehicle’s integrated display and premium audio system. Check out what the Representative Director, President, and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc., Izumi Kawanishi, had to say: </p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies AFEELA’s vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one. Through this integration, we are elevating the customer’s entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The blog post also reveals that players will need a broadband connection of at least 5 Mbps, and a stable connection of at least 15 Mbps is recommended for a smooth PS Remote Play experience. Additionally, players will require a PlayStation 5 or PlayStation 4 to access Remote Play. </p>







<p>In other news, Sony and Tencent have settled their lawsuit out of court, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-clone-lawsuit-settled-with-light-of-motiram-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light of Motiram being delisted</a> from major storefronts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima has made new comments about AI, stating there’s no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’</p>



<p>&nbsp;AI in the gaming industry has been a subject of contention since the community started learning about the new tech. Most recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Larian Game Studios has been under fire</a> for using AI. Now, a highly regarded game director has shared his thoughts on it, revealing there’s no running away from it. </p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-embracing-ai-as-there-is-no-going-back">Hideo Kojima Talks About Embracing AI, As There is No Going Back</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima shared his thoughts about AI. Kojima first noted that smartphones were also ‘slated’ by everyone when they first came out, and now we live in a world where “there are so many people who can’t live without their smartphones.” Kojima added that AI is similar to that, and it’s essential “to use technology in a way that will make us happy.”</p>



<p>Kojima also added that there is no point in saying things like ‘We shouldn’t use AI’ or ‘AI is useless.’ There is no going back, and smartphones were the same. Kojima also spoke about the possibility of AI changing how we communicate, helping people who aren’t the best at face-to-face interactions. In the same vein, Kojima also talked about how AI could make humans spoiled, so there should be measures to ”&nbsp;reduce the AI’s involvement, or have days where we don’t use it.”</p>







<p>In other news, Kojima had joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-zootopia-2-cameo-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zootopia 2 cast</a> just days before the release. Additionally, the director <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-matrix-game-konami-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could have made a Matrix game</a>, but Konami shut it down.

                <p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163"></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home.</p><p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Sony Honda Mobility COO Izumi Kawanishi <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>. "Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p><p>Afeela 1 will be available in California first before it goes nationwide. But aside from a 2026 release window, it doesn't currently have an on-sale date.</p>

                <p>Overwatch developer Blizzard has teased that 2026 will be the year when the studio's "boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>"We're eager to take creative steps that will allow the game to lean further into storytelling and character development, and we can't wait to share these new experiences with our community," Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "There's a real sense of momentum and optimism within the development team, and we believe 2026 will be a year where our boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>Blizzard did not share any further details, but 2026 marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and the studio presumably has some anniversary plans in store for the milestone.</p><p>Also in the post, Blizzard ran through some reflections of the past year, saying 2025 "brought out the best in the Overwatch team."</p><p>"Inspired by the evolving landscape of the industry, we embraced the opportunity to take bold risks and focused on making impactful changes rather than playing it safe," the developer said. "The response from our community has been amazing, and we feel our relationship with our players is stronger than ever."</p><p>Blizzard also called out how Overwatch 2 relaunching in China was a "standout moment" for the game in 2025. "Despite the absence, the community’s passion remained strong, with fans organizing offline events, creating art, and supporting esports. This enduring passion for the Overwatch universe highlighted how the game brings people together and means so much beyond just gameplay, reinforcing our excitement for the future," the developer said.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and studio president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/" data-ref-id="1100-6537061">Johanna Faries said it will be the "biggest year yet" for the company.</a> The company is bringing back BlizzCon in September 2026 to share a number of "major" announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Photo by Colton "Anarche99" Childrey via UVW-CWA</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last week </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://uvw-cwa.org/">United Videogame Workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (UVW-CWA) made quite the splash with a showy protest at the 2025 Game Awards in downtown Los Angeles. Armed with signs, fake tombstones, and leaflets, they briefly turned the celebration into a funeral for the video game industry. The Grim Reaper made an appearance. A digital billboard on the back of a cube truck drove up and down Figueroa St. And even an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crew member stopped by to grieve all those lost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't worry, this wasn't a case of critical misdiagnosis. Speaking to Game Developer as the sun went down and the ceremony was about to begin, the protest organizers explained they put on the show to spotlight the thousands of workers laid off by studios large and small in 2025, and to cast a spotlight on the CEOs and executives who ordered the cuts, many of whom were at the show. (I think I saw Matt Booty sprint by while I conducted my interview).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The gathering was an unconventional twist on the many protests staged outside the awards over the last few years. With no ongoing strike or recent major news event to peg the protest to, the group brainstormed a creative way to get their message across—and their process and motivation shone a light on where game industry unionization may be headed in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-trends-that-made-and-plagued-this-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">The 10 game industry trends that made (and plagued) this year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A dirge for executives and a party for players">A dirge for executives and a party for players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The UVW protestors set out that evening to creatively catch the eye of two groups: attending executives and senior developers, along with players footing hundreds of dollars to attend the awards in-person. "It's important to remember that we are the reason why they have a show," said UVW secretary Kaitlin "KB" Bonfiglio. They sported "wanted" posters with the faces of Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav, EA CEO Andrew Wilson, and Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick, along with their salaries presented against what the average game developer makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Planning for the spectacle began a few months ago and emerged out of a voting process by UVW members—everything from the budget to the strategy came about through worker consensus. Despite the dour theming, UVW treasurer Sherveen Uduwana said the goal was not only to "acknowledge the harm" but also to "build excitement" for what can be done through unionizing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Silly protests with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/opinion/no-kings-protest-chicago-tactical-frivolity.html">costumed characters have been quite mainstream in 2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with commentators like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/802315/portland-no-kings-october-ice-protests-frog-antifa">Sarah Jeong</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> observing that they helped turn protests like the No Kings Rallies into joyful affairs that felt more like Disneyland than hellish warzones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most major industry figures had easier ways in and out of the Peacock theater (LA Live security only let them approach the small ice rink near the theater's edge after attempting to keep them off the property), so it's unlikely the three men would have seen their own faces. But, in a bit of luck, the increased number of non-professionals attending the show worked out in UVW's favor. As the line to enter the venue snaked around the corner, many got to speak with union organizers face-to-face.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fifa-and-netflix-partner-for-a-new-football-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">FIFA and Netflix partner for a new soccer game</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This ties into what players and the gaming audience might be interested in," commented Uduwana. "A lot of that overlaps with what they care about [like] rushed and buggy launches, games that are suddenly canceled without warning, launches that make it clear these companies are just trying to take your money and don't care about the quality of the product."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those negative events are, according to the group, driven by executives pursuing profits at the expense of workers. "We want to be able to do our jobs at a high level of capability. We want the bosses to get out of the way and let us do those jobs. Allowing us to get our organizing wins is going to make higher quality, more exciting, and more ambitious games possible."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made">A bill of rights, firing protections, and agency over the way games are made</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/tencent-and-sony-settle-horizon-cloning-lawsuit" target="_self" data-discover="true">Tencent and Sony reach 'confidential settlement' on Horizon cloning lawsuit</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going into 2026, the Uduwana said the organization is preparing a "bill of rights" for game workers that workers can use to identify immediate terms to raise in unionization drives. "That is basically us talking to workers this whole year, understanding what the high-priority asks are going to be, and putting together...essentially an organizing floor that we can use for future campaigns."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers looking for additional demands from their employers can build off of these terms for what their studio specifically needs.

Strongly-worded terms about what action employers may take for what employees post on their personal social media accounts can shield workers from harassment campaigns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That has been one of the concerns we've had since the founding of UVW," said UVW vice president "Audrey" (who requested to go by their first name) in regards to online harassment of developers.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans are concerned Jonathan Bailey, this year's People's Sexiest Man Alive, may have been recast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG - or at least has recorded under unfavourable conditions.</p>
<p>Bailey has voiced fan-favourite cat boy G'raha Tia since the Stormblood expansion, released in 2017. But this was before he starred in the likes of Bridgerton, Wicked, and Jurassic World Rebirth, from which his fame has risen considerably.</p>
<p>This week, the 7.4 update was released for Final Fantasy 14, bringing an extension to the story and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-morello-final-fantasy-14-interview-everything-burns">new song from Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello</a>. Yet fans have noticed G'raha Tia's voice sounds a little off.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzr6b/jonathan_bailey_in_74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit thread posits</a> either the character is no longer voiced by Bailey, or he's been recording away from the studio - likely between other major projects he's worked on.</p>
<p>"It also feels like they're minimising his speaking - he had a total of two lines in the first two quests, and at one point just emoted a thumbs up," the post reads. "He felt conspicuously silent for G'raha, someone who is way too sentimental to barely say anything at a goodbye."</p>
<p>The poster later added they think it is still Bailey, but a combination of hoarse throat and a subpar microphone "adds some gruffness to his voice".</p>
<p>Fans have also been sharing comparison videos on social media, to highlight the differences in the voice work.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So I did a quick little comparison between 7.0 and 7.4 G'raha Tia, it seems that he HAS NOT been recast, I just think he's recording his lines from his phone or a subpar mic setup, the EQ is sorta way more treble-y, when his voice is usually bassy with the studio mics they use. <a href="https://t.co/AYYZYadgWU">pic.twitter.com/AYYZYadgWU</a></p>— Josefumi 🎙️ (@JosefumiVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/JosefumiVO/status/2000983922734457059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>In an interview with BAFTA last year, Bailey recognised Final Fantasy 14 alongside his other voice work, and how important the character is to the fanbase.</p>
<p>"I'm aware of how important this character is to so many people," he said. "I was so determined to not step away from this character, that when I was doing Company [in the West End in 2018] I had to record this in the day for about a week doing eight shows a night and my tongue inflamed. So I think, any die-hard fans out there, there's a few hours of playing where I sound a bit lispy, that's because of that. So I apologise."</p>

<p>As such, fans hope he is still working on the game, despite the apparent changes in quality.</p>
<p>That said, a representative for Bailey told <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-jonathan-bailey-graha-tia-voice-recast-2000654279">Kotaku</a> he "won't be commenting or participating in any interviews regarding Final Fantasy 14" at this time. Square Enix has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>What is clear is the size of the role of G'raha Tia has certainly reduced since the highs of Shadowbringers, though whether that's due to Bailey or simply storytelling is unknown. Indeed, one criticism of latest expansion Dawntrail is that multiple popular characters don't receive enough screen time.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Naoki Yoshida told me last year</a>.</p>
<p>"I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, then, whether G'raha Tia or other popular characters could be written out of the game in future. No doubt we'll get answers at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">Fan Fest events next year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Independent]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The indie game scene is where you will always find the more experimental titles that big publishers may not feel comfortable funding. It is such a vibrant scene that allows smaller teams and individuals to really go all out. There were a number of outstanding independent games released in 2025, and it was tough to decide on a top three, especially with how muddy the waters can be when trying to determine what counts as “indie” and not, but having made our decision, it’s time to lick the stamp and send it.</p>

<p>After coming up as runner up in our Best Narrative Award, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch">Dispatch</a> has taken the crown to be the best Independent game of 2025. It blends great classic Telltale like storytelling with an excellent visual presentation, and fun superhero management gameplay. AdHoc Studio’s debut title has managed to set a new bar for episodic games, the likes of which we have really not seen for years.</p>


<p>Dispatch manages to take a rather normal segments of life, office politics and a dispatcher job, and turn them on their heads to provide a fun spin. Office politics are a lot harder to handle when you are dealing with beings that could cause you all sorts of problems without breaking a sweat. AdHoc has managed something many studios have struggled to do in the past, and that is balance fun gameplay with a great story, and a memorable look.</p>
<h3>Hades II – Runner Up</h3>
<p>It would be remiss of us not to have the sequel to our Best Independent Game 2020 winner as part of this list. While it can be argued that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hades-ii">Hades II</a> does not quite meet the same heights as the original Hades, very few games could do that. What we have in Hades II is a stellar sequel which saw resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths, and a more mechanically involved combat system all added to expand the system.</p>

<p>Hades II also brought us a new protagonist, Melinoe, and a story which sees the Titans declare war on Mount Olympus. Everything is absolutely solid in Hades II and it is only that the story was slightly less engaging than the original for why this has game has not climbed to the top of our Best Independent mountain. Hades II didn’t beat what many consider the perfect game, but it came near close to matching its predecessor.</p>
<h3>Ball X Pit – Runner Up</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a> is what you would call a mad mashup of ideas that works really well. Developed by Kenny Sun and some friends, it takes brick breaking, base building, and ball attacks to mix it all up into one of the most entertaining roguelikes of the year. It is a fast paced and intense experience with balls flying everywhere as you fight off waves of monsters. Balls can be fused to make new ball loadouts that have various effects, and you also need to rebuild Ballbylon so you can get even more power ups in your fight to beat the monsters.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that is very hard to put down once you have started your run, the action and need for quick thinking definitely grabbing your attention. Add in the colourful and bold action on the screen with the engrossing gameplay, Ball X Pit is an indie game that has captured a huge audience that just want to unload their balls.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloverpit</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo-review-stringing-you-along/">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Phew! That’s a pretty big one out of the way. We’ll keep our awards rolling through the weekend. I hope that sounds good to you. Sounds… geddit? See you tomorrow.</p>

            <p>The nights are heavy, the sun is frail. The mountain moans its hunger. The rivers are frozen scars and the trees are become hard flashes of black lightning. Bells haunt the wind and peculiar bearded men appear in the fireplaces, to be chased away with pies and brandy. The roses, strangely, are in bloom. 
</p>
<p>Put on your slippers. Stoke the embers. Pull up a chair. It is time to remember. It is time to renew. It is time to succumb to a growing addiction. It is time… to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skeal">Skeal</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>If you’ve played Skeal with us before, there is no need for further words - here’s a link to the <a href="https://whymog.itch.io/skeal-webgl-version">browser version</a>. If you’ve yet to play Skeal, further words will only spoil things. Go on, it’s free.
</p>
<p>Playing Skeal has been an RPS wintermas tradition since Alice O <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skeal-free-skiing-game">declared it so in 2017</a>. After Alice O returned to the sea in 2024 - rumour has it she may indeed now live in a greying tower - Graham <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-almost-christmas-which-means-its-time-to-play-skeal">took up the torch</a>. Now Graham is gone, and I continue the tradition in their stead. Am I making you sad? Excellent – this is the appropriate mood in which to play Skeal. But it’s the good kind of sadness, the sadness of release, the sadness of… truly terrible puns.

<p>Skeal is sort of a lesson in how you can transform a slight cringe into a teary-eyed guffaw by dragging out the punchline and committing to it whole-heartedly. It shouldn’t make me bawl but it does. I am going to get my sister’s partner to play it this holiday. He’s approximately the same age as me and I’m pretty sure this will make him weep too.</p><p>Then I will show it to my nephew, who will look at me like I’ve just offered to feed him a bowl of toothpaste. The key thing is that emotions will be had. I hope Skeal makes you have emotions too.
</p>
<p>Once more with feeling: Skeal is the work of Nick Cummings, who also makes games about <a href="https://www.whymog.net/games">laundry separation, hermit crabs and racoonomics</a>. St Nick, we should call him. Merry Decemberween all.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Drops a 5-Star Laptop by 70% and Throws in $199 Worth of Accessories, Only on Amazon Not the Official Site]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-drops-a-5-star-laptop-by-70-and-throws-in-199-worth-of-accessories-only-on-amazon-not-the-official-site-2000654786</link>
            <guid>1388260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab a new laptop without breaking the bank. We’re spotting plenty of amazing deals on a wide range of machines from popular brands like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and even Apple – basically, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">One of our favorite discounts, however, is this 70% drop on the 15.6-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which brings the overall price down to just $650, but that’s not all.</a> You’re also getting a 6-in-1 accessory bundle worth almost $200 with your purchase for free, which adds even more value to the offer. This deal applies to the stunning moonlight blue version, which gives off a premium, sleek look. Just note that the discount wraps up soon, so it’s best to grab it before the price shoots back up to $2,200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Power</h2>
<p>You’re greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch Full HD display upon opening the laptop. The screen features an ultra-thin 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel for a bigger viewing area, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals easy on your eyes. Touch support takes this a bit further by making navigation a breeze. You won’t have to rely on the trackpad or the mouse solely to get things done. Need to scroll a long document? Just use your fingers directly on the screen. The included touchscreen pen also makes it quite easy to swipe, draw, sketch, and even type!</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard, alongside a dedicated numeric keypad, which is quite comfortable to use. It provides your wrist with the support it needs for jotting down long documents, plus includes a dedicated Copilot key that launches the helpful AI assistant instantly. There’s also a built-in webcam, with integrated microphones for convenient video calls.</p>



<p>Power comes from the combination of an Intel Core i3-N305 processor and a modest 16GB RAM. Together, these let you push through busy, productive days with ease, regardless of the task at hand. The 1TB SSD, on the other hand, offers ample space to store all your important documents and files in a single place, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge offers over 9 hours of use, which means you can go an entire workday without worrying about running out of power. Recharging is fast too, so you won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long when running low. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a touchscreen pen, a 128GB thumb drive, a laptop bag, a cleaning cloth, a camera protector, dust plugs, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. That’s everything you need to get started with work and entertainment, right away, and you’re basically getting far more than just a direct discount with this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">This laptop is currently down to just $650 at Amazon, which is practically nothing for a device this packed.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer won’t be around for long. Grab it while there’s still time, as it could wrap up any moment now. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>

                <p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/">PlayStation Wrap-Up</a>, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1999147161989128217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap</a> has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?</p><p>While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/">we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September</a>, and Blizzard has teased its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/">biggest year yet</a>" for 2026.</p><p>Outside of Microsoft, several other gaming franchises will also have plenty of reasons to celebrate. The 30th anniversary of Pokemon is next year, Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and both The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania will reach the 40th anniversary milestone in 2026.</p><p>We have contacted Xbox to find out if there are any plans for a year-in-review wrap-up, and will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

		<p>Slavic Magic has released a major new update for Manor Lords, its medieval strategy game, with the update adding a new option to choose starting locations, new maps, new buildings and jobs associated with them, ladder climbing for units, and a whole host of changes for resources. Additionally, policies have been removed temporarily from Manor Lords as they require additional development time. You can check out the full list of changes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Manor Lords - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edB0J0bS-4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Manor Lords Update 5 Version 0.8.029–0.8.050 patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Starting Location Selection</b>: Ability to select the starting location in the game setup screen for the player and adversaries.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Maps</b>: Devil’s Hill, Jagged Cliffs, Divided and Lake Lemm.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Game Modes</b>: Duel (1 vs 1 with AI) and Fractured Realm (4 Lord free-for-all).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Buildings, Jobs &amp; Resources</b>: Quarry, Stonemason, Lime Kiln, and their connected resources: Rough Stone, Dressed Stone, Mortar.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Positioning</b>: A new system for positioning units on walls.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Ladder Climbing</b>: Units now climb ladders to access higher floors.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Hover Fortifications</b>: The player can now hover the castle fortifications and see the soldiers inside.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Gate Control</b>: Added the ability to open and close each castle gate individually.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Castle Upgrade System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Module Upgrades</b>: Every castle module, including walls and gates, can now be upgraded to lv2.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Placement Logic</b>: Module placement is no longer restricted by distance to the nearest major module. The planner now displays the total Bailey Area. The Bailey area allowed for construction is limited by your lord’s or lady’s Rank (still WIP).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wall Platforms</b>: You can now attach platforms to the castle walls. The level of platforms is capped by the wall type.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Affinity System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Environment Types</b>: Each Region is divided by area into multiple Environment Types: (Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Urban, Rural).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Building Affinities</b>: Different buildings can have Affinities with different Environment Types, for instance, the Animal Pen has a “Pannage” Affinity which decreases the time to yield for Pig Pens relative to the Woodland area.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Maintenance System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li><b>Workplace Maintenance</b>: A lot of workplaces now must be maintained by delivering resources to function properly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Failure Risks</b>: Failure to maintain a building can result in various risks, such as collapse for mines, injury and even a minor death chance.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rate Tuning</b>: You can tune a workplace’s level of maintenance, affecting Labor Speed.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Yield System:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Yield Definition</b>: Yield is a measure of how much your workplace produces. Various buildings use different timespans and benchmark values depending on their nature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Yield Influencers</b>: Yield can be affected by Labor Speed, Efficiency, and Productivity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Labor Speed</b>: Labor Speed measures how fast your workers perform workplace related tasks.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Efficiency</b>: Efficiency measures how much output you get per input when crafting, per plant when farming or per passive income cycle, depending on the production type. High Efficiency means your Gardens will produce more Vegetables and your Crafting tasks may produce extra items.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Productivity</b>: Productivity is a measure of your logistics: transport and labor times vs idle times, sickness, extension work and militia assignments.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Approval Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Memory Weight Shift</b>: Approval memory weight was shifted to dramatically favor current events versus past events.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Approval Tiers</b>: There are now 7 approval Tiers. Landing in a specific Approval Tier will give various penalties and bonuses to growth, influence, income among others.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Food Resource Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Food Categories</b>:All foods now fit within food categories; Foraged Goods, Meats, Fishes, Vegetables, Grains and Animal Produce.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Burgage Plot Requirement overhaul</b>: Burgage Plots now require a variety of foods from different categories, encouraging more diverse variety as they upgrade.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Vegetables</b>: Vegetables resource was split into Cabbages, Carrots and Beetroots.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Orchards</b>: In addition to Apples, Pears and Quinces were added as new Orchard options.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Meats</b>: Meat was divided into: Mutton, Chevon, Pork, Beef, Chicken, Small Game, and is produced by their respective animals accordingly.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Expanded Fish</b>: Fish was divided into Carp (from ponds) and Eel (from rivers).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>New Food:</b>&nbsp;Milk is passively produced by Goats for the Animal Produce category.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Wild Animals</b>: Deer were replaced by Small Game since it’s more plausible in historical terms. Small Game also yields Pelts, which is an early trade commodity.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Foraged Goods</b>: Alongside Berries, Mushrooms have been reintroduced as a Foraged Good.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Honey</b>: Honey is no longer consumed. It is intended for use in a future update, but for now can be sold, while the Apiary Extension boosts the yield of Farms and Orchards through the Pollination Affinity.<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Regional Development System Rework:</b><br>
<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Development Perks</b>: To a lot of players, the development tree was a weak point of the game and described as immersion breaking. Therefore, a new, more grounded system of Development Perks has been introduced. The player will now face more realistic choices at each settlement level and those choices reflect the settlement development stage.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Perk Design</b>: The perks are also designed to be more nuanced from a game design perspective so that choices are less immediately obvious, but compound into strong specializations over time.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Rollout Status</b>: Since it’s still in progress, only the first batch of perks (Origins) is available.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li><b>Policies</b>: Policies are temporarily removed (still undergoing rework).<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>General:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a lot of chance based mechanics in favor of more deterministic calculations to make yield balance more predictable (this includes farming and mining which used to be chance based).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Yields are more linear as Orchard Trees and Field Crops mature.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Moved consumption &amp; approval data to the Family structure instead of storing it on husbands (this was a temporary workaround to represent per family consumption and approval effects).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Since individual villagers no longer have a consumption update, we also moved the disease data to the Family structure. As a side effect, whole families will now get sick together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Fishing nodes often spawn in rivers now (allowing river fishing).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Streams now use the river system and therefore will spawn small bridges.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new Elevation overlay for use with Farming and Livestock.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Replaced the Brewery extension placeholder.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an additional road to Wirnitz in Germanic Valley<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an extra hard cap for storage distribution limits, eg. if a stall has 21 items for some reason but only 20 storage space, the extra item will not count as supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality of Life Improvements:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a “Protect Resource Area” checkbox for the Logging Camp and Firewood Cutter which makes workers automatically avoid deforestation near vulnerable resources.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Worker families assigned to a building being upgraded will now participate in the construction.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber for construction will get the nearest log instead of nearest on the ground before from buildings.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Oxen transporting Timber will now prioritize delivering to a target near where the Timber is picked up.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Blocked sons with jobs from refueling the home if there is a female family member without any task that can do it instead.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Workplace animals will now be assigned a home as close as possible to the workplace.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When debranching a tree, Workers will always pick the one closest to them.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When cutting down a tree, Workers will pick the nearest one, unless too far away from the Logging Camp.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Changed order of goods produced for Blacksmith and Joiner to list Spears and Large shields first.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Artisans will start producing the first listed good when their workshop is built.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Trading Post Workers will now only use Horses that are assigned to their Trading Post (Horses are automatically assigned when they arrive).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Due to tester feedback, storage building workers supply their Stalls from their own Storehouse/Granary only.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When taking care of the dead, bodies will now be moved to the nearest Corpse Pit or Church.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Manor Specific:</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Manors no longer have families living in them (since Manors aren’t residential and can’t fulfil requirements it was always a bit weird).<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When castle modules are placed on a wall, they will split the wall and snap the walls to edges instead of clipping with the module.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added an option to join 2 walls into 1 after you snap their ends together.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Added missing wall snapping points to the outer towers.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>When rotating a module, the attached walls should now stay attached. The rotation is limited if a module has wall connections.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Castle modules now collide with each other when placing in order to avoid building areas impossible for pathfinding and reduce clipping.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Adjustments:</b><wbr></p>

<wbr></li>
<li>Apiary is now a backyard extension. Wax is now produced every third cycle from an Apiary.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Removed the “Fence up” Upgrade from fields since it’s a leftover of the previous development tree and doesn’t quite fit anymore.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Temporary removal of the “Force Early Harvest” button in the Farmhouse.<br>
<wbr></li>
<li>Granary workers no longer supply Windmills since it was inconsistent with all the other workplaces needing to get their own crafting resources.<br>

</ul>
<p><b>Technical:</b><br>

<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>
