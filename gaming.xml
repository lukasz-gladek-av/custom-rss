		<p>Update 1.55 is out now for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and it’s got some great new cars and additions to the racing game, including a new formula car inspired by classic 90s F1 designs, and wider support for the Gran Turismo Sophy AI.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot; Free Update - January 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLBtn5F5j2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Four cars have been added in Gran Turismo 7 update 1.55:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gran Turismo F3500-A</li>
<li>Honda Civic Si Extra (EF) ’87</li>
<li>Hyundai IONIQ 5 N ‘24</li>
<li>Toyota C-HR S ’18</li>
</ul>
<p>All four can be purchased from Brand Central, giving us a modern crossover SUV, a rather popular electric car, an 80s touring car classic, and the original formula racing car as well.</p>
<p>The F3500-A is inspired by early 90s F1 cars, and I can definitely see shades of the Williams FW14B and FW15C, the McLaren MP4/8 and Jordan 191 in the curved from nose down to the front wing – there’s going to be some awesome custom liveries for this probably by later today! In-game, this will have a 3.5L naturally aspirated V12 that’s going to scream with high RPMs as you go through the 6-speed semi-auto gearbox.</p>

<p>Beyond the cars, there’s a new Extra Menu No. 43 for Group C cars, and there’s new World Circuit events:</p>
<p>Sunday Cup: Kyoto Driving Park – Miyabi<br>
Japanese FF Challenge 450: Sardegna – Road Track – C<br>
World Touring Car 600: Autódromo de Interlagos</p>
<p>Gran Turismo Sophy has also been expanded to two more circuits, no available to race against at Autódromo de Interlagos and Mount Panorama Circuit.</p>
<p>A strong update to start 2025!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> is a 2.5D Soulsvania from Primal Game Studio, in which you electrify, bisect or incinerate handsome, ravening night creatures in a world of heaped skulls and burning spires. Yes, I'm well aware that "2.5D" and "Soulsvania" are nonsense words, woven by pestilent market forces. Samuel Johnson is turning in his grave, I expect. He has risen from his grave and equipped himself with an ironbound dictionary and is even now making his way through the layers of the English language, hellbent on slaughtering every 'vania yet coined.</p>
<p>But never mind Samuel. Oversized rodents and spiders aside, Mandragora is notable for being written by Brian Mitsoda, writer of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">former narrative lead for its sequel at Hardsuit Labs</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">lives on in the hands of The Chinese Room</a>.

<p>Some plot from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">Steam page</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Mankind has surrendered the world to the monsters. The people of Faelduum hide away behind walls of brick and palisades of ignorance, constructed by their leaders. Joy and delight are coveted jewels, out of reach of the masses. This is not the world you were promised. Travel by night and take it back."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ooh.</p>
<p>You get a choice of classes and a set of nodular skill trees which look like blood spatter from a recent murder. You also get a travelling caravan you can populate with artisans who'll craft your kit. While some of the bigger munsters seem a bit spongy in the footage, I find them appealingly diseased and frenzied. I don't get the impression you'll be duelling many proud knights in armour. I also like the specific gradation of rotten beauty they're going for with the "painterly", seeping backdrops.</p><p>As for Mitsoda's contribution, you will "make devastating choices in a sinister and immersive story". He joined the project back in 2022. Here's an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1721060/view/3689050339694282320">interview from 2023</a> in which he breaks down what a narrative designer actually does, and offers some advice to game devs on "how to introduce a new world in a way that feels organic to the player". An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Don't wholesale copy something else, but feel free to mash up a bunch of influences. Figure out what you can do to make it different from other games in its genre while also appealing to fans of that genre. Focus on the characters - you can have a cliche plot, but the characters will keep people interested and keep the story relatable. Don't "magic" or "technobabble" for a solution - try to make sure everything in the game follows rules that are established and the player understands."</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you'd like to wash that down with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-without-a-vampire-bloodlines-b-mitsoda">one of our own interviews with Mitsoda about the craft of writing video games</a>, from way back in 2009.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sony has announced that the 30th anniversary classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 themes will be removed from consoles tomorrow, January 21st, 2025. However, due to their popularity,&nbsp;they will return.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the fantastic response to the classic PlayStation, PS2, PS3, and PS4 limited-time console themes, which will be leaving tomorrow,” reads a post on <a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/1884979891067863448">Twitter</a>. “Due to the positive response on these 4 themes, we’re doing some work behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.”</p>


<p>“While there aren’t plans to create additional themes in the future, we’re excited to keep celebrating legacy PlayStation hardware with you all,” added Sony.</p>
<p>Themes were popular for both the PS3 and PS4 console user interfaces but are notably absent on PlayStation 5 with the 30th anniversary themes being the only ones available. Clearly, the tech is in place for themes to work on the console but for some reason, Sony has decided not to make any for the PS5. They used to be a regular occurrence on the older consoles with themes launched to promote upcoming games or events.</p>

<p>With the 30th anniversary period coming to a close, it’s odd Sony didn’t make a bigger event of it. There were no game announcements,&nbsp; no parties, no celebrations,&nbsp; not even a fan vote for the best PlayStation game of all time. What we did get was a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/sony-reveal-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary/">free-to-play version of Gran Turismo,</a> some soundtracks on Spotify, and a weird board game though so… yay for those?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-directorate-novitiate-reveal-trailer-drops-third-person-action-rpg-set-in-2006/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The official reveal trailer has dropped for The Directorate: Novitiate, revealing a new narrative-driven single-player game that will be a third-person action RPG, with the game taking place in Los Angeles. This title is being developed and published by Nesting Games.</p>
<p>The year is 2006, and the world is magic-infused. In this game, you'll be playing as Mercury, where you will get to use a mixture of guns and magic to fight off supernatural threats and chase down a serial killer across Los Angeles. To see what you can expect from The Directorate: Novitiate, make sure to check out the official reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Directorate: Novitiate – Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XH0XEYavkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for this game has been released, revealing the base features you need to know about the game. If you liked<a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-trademarks-fbc-firebreak/"> Control</a> or Alan Wake, then this may be a game you want to keep an eye on. It has very similar themes and styles of combat, from what is seen in the GIFs on Steam.</p>
<p>Kana Luna (Mercury) finds her life turned upside down as she becomes involved with the Costa Muerta, a Dark Syndicate of the Directorate. Because of this, she now needs to hone her skills, where you'll help her rise up from the rank of Novitiate.</p>
<p>It will be much more than just guns and magic, as there will be a high-stakes story to go along with it. While you will get to experience the traditional third-person shooter mechanics, there will also be magic spells that you can utilize, as well as the ability to upgrade your skills and perform finishing moves that add flare and style to the scene.</p>
<p>As with any high-stakes story, there will also be important player decisions to be made, where your choices will impact the story later down the line. You have to make the decision on whether you want to remain loyal to the Edicts of the Directorate or choose to stay in the real world. However, this will all have consequences for friends, foes, and more.</p>
<p>At the moment, the game doesn't have a planned release date, with more details to come in the future and a release period to be confirmed at a later date.</p>
<p>Will you be playing The Directorate: Novitiate when it releases?</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-blade-chimera">Patrick Recommends: <em>Blade Chimera</em></h2><figure></figure><p><strong>Very Cool Game Name:</strong> <em>Blade Chimera</em><br><strong>Platforms: </strong>Switch (it runs great on Steam Deck), PC<br><strong>Developer: </strong>Ladybug, who I had not heard of but apparently has made a whole series of great games that are as good as, if not better than, <em>Blade Chimera</em></p><p>On some level, it's my job to be aware of upcoming video games, and yet, it's always great when a video game can surprise you. <em>Blade Chimera</em> is one of those, a game I discovered while casually scrolling through Steam's chaotic new releases category and going "oh, <em>what's that</em>?" (<a href="https://remapradio.com/video/whats-new-on-steam/" rel="noreferrer">It directly inspired our new video feature</a>.)</p><p>A little more than 10 hours later, I had absolutely devoured this sci-fi take on <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>, full of delightful and colorful bouncing damage numbers, endorphin-releasing level up sequences, and genuinely thrilling (if a lil' easy) combat. The exploration leave something to be desired, as it's awfully straightforward and gatekept, but if you're looking to scratch an itch, <em>Blade Chimera</em> is happy to do so with  sick ass guns. It's too bad the "true ending" is locked behind a boring collectible hunt, but eh...the "normal" ending is just fine.</p><p>This game put me on a <em>Metroid</em> kick, as I've already dumped a bunch of hours into another excellent (but dour!!!) one-of-these, <em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends-the-dynasty">Rob Recommends: <em>The Dynasty</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Until Patrick Mahomes’ second season in the NFL, it seemed unthinkable that the predominance the New England Patriots enjoyed within the NFL would ever be repeated. For two decades, with only brief runs of poor form, the Patriots were consistently in contention to win the Super Bowl despite the league’s long-term efforts to make it impossible to build durable championship teams. They were also frequently embroiled in scandals that ranged from oddly petty to grimly violent. <em>The Dynasty</em>, streaming on AppleTV+,<em> </em>is a detailed history of this era, unpacking the team’s unlikely rise and chronicling the ways it breached rules and doubled-down on a reputation and attitude that made them widely loathed.</p><p>Post <em>The Last Dance</em>, every sports documentary seems to have a legacy-burnishing angle. <em>The Dynasty </em>seems like it is team owner Robert Kraft’s attempt to write himself into the history books as more than just the deep pockets behind the team. As he lays out, he was the nurturing, caring figure at the top of the Patriots in contrast to Bill Belichick‘s pathological coldness that crossed into cruelty. There might be an argument for Kraft’s importance in keeping Tom Brady from cracking under his coach’s psychological brutality, but even in this sympathetic telling, it’s hard to tell how much an impact Kraft really had in shaping the identity of the Patriots and the vaunted Patriot Way.</p><p>However, <em>The Dynasty </em>is more than just a reputation exercise. It’s a study in how miserable success can be. Players describe a tense atmosphere where at any moment you might find yourself replaced or publicly humiliated or both. Tom Brady is described by teammates as one of the most brutally picked-on members of the team, held to impossible standards almost to underscore to the rest of the team that if Bill can treat the greatest QB in history like a junior varsity scrub, imagine what he could do to the rest of them. </p><p>The dissonance is fascinating to watch. Everyone involved with the Patriots is proud of what they achieved, they love going back and telling the stories of their unlikely triumphs and the way they won in spite of a league that was always trying to hit them with exaggerated cheating charges. But the players especially seem ambivalent. They’re still relatively young, far from the age when they emerge like graying veterans to attend team events and reunions and everything is recast through rose-tinted lenses. They are a group of men nearing or in the midst of middle age, trying to explain how the place where they did the greatest work of their professional lives was a place of personal angst and dread, constantly on the verge of imploding from black hole of ambition and demand that was their coach. It‘s not the primary question of <em>The Dynasty </em>but it’s the most interesting one that takes increasing prominence in the background: was all this worth it?</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-desierto">Cado Recommends: <em>Desierto</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of itch.io</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Itch.io Descriptipon: </strong>This is a game about getting lost.<br><strong>Platform: </strong><a href="https://josyan.itch.io/desierto?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Browser/HTML 5<br></a><strong>Developer: </strong><a href="https://josyan.itch.io/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">José Sanz "Josyan"</a></p><p>You ever randomly scroll on itch.io and get bodied by a stunning piece of art? Well, that's what happened to me when I randomly came across <em>Desierto</em> one night. Something about the monochrome digital pointillism of the cover drew me instantly in, and the game itself did not disappoint (aside from the fact that I wish there were more). It's amazingly short. 25-ish minutes, free, and you can play it in your browser. If this piece of art calls to you the way it called to me, I implore you to jump in and spend a little time getting lost.</p>

But some options are clearly better for others, especially if you’re shopping within a specific price range. To help with that decision, I’ve put together a list of my three favorite choices for gaming phones. Let’s get into it.</p><h2 id="h20330"><a id="rog"></a>Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro: A premium experience for hardcore mobile gamers</h2><p>Most phones can play the majority of mobile games in some capacity, so you don’t necessarily need to buy a gaming-specific phone to enjoy playing. But if you want the best of the best performance, software designed specifically for gaming, and a battery that beats basically every other phone on the market, then you should take a look at the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. That is, of course, if you’re willing to stomach its rather high price of $1,000 for the 256GB model, with an extra $200 and $500 charge for 512GB and 1TB respectively.</p><p>The Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro’s massive 6.78-inch display can hit up to a 185hz refresh rate to ensure your games look and run the best they can. Additionally, this beastly phone comes packed with a variety of hardware and software features that help it stand out as a “gaming phone”, such as air-trigger shoulder buttons and a wide selection of settings that let you customize your gaming experience well beyond that of any other phone. </p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</strong>   </h4><p> Though not technically a “gaming phone”, a large display and flagship  specs make this popular flagship a great choice for daily use and  gaming.  </p></div><h2 id="h20331"><a id="1+"></a>OnePlus 13: A standard flagship phone with solid gaming performance</h2><p>The OnePlus 13 is one of the most versatile flagship phones around with its exceptional battery life, gorgeous OLED display, and near-stock Android software. Luckily, it’s also a wonderful choice for gaming thanks to what’s under the hood. If you’re willing to drop flagship money on this phone, you’ll be rewarded with a high-end processor, plenty of RAM, and some very impressive temperature control that makes sure you stay cool while gaming. The OnePlus 13 starts at $900.</p><p>Like the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro, the OnePlus 13 also includes baked-in gaming-related features that allow you a lot of customization over how your games look and perform, which can make you feel like you’re using a more specialized “gaming phone” during your play sessions. Sure, it can’t quite compete with the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro in terms of features, but it still offers an impressive set of bells and whistles for gamers that elevate this device above many others in its price range.</p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong>  </h4><p> It’s hard to go wrong with any recent iPhone for killer gaming  performance on a large screen, but the iPhone 16 Pro Max is your best  choice as an Apple user.  </p></div><h2 id="h20332"><a id="gal"></a>Samsung Galaxy A51: An entry level device at an entry level price</h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51 proves you don’t have to buy a flagship phone to have fun gaming. While this aging budget phone is missing a lot of the gaming-focused features that you can get with more expensive devices, it’s still capable of keeping up with most modern mobile games even when pushing for high settings with decent framerates.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy A51's 6.5-inch screen serves up a nice 1080p picture, but it won’t exactly blow you away with incredible picture quality. Even so, it’s more than enough for the average gamer who isn’t counting pixels. Plus, it’s bright enough to play outdoors or in other well-lit environments. However, the battery isn’t going to hold up to extensive unplugged gaming sessions, so keep a charger on hand if you go with this budget offering. You can snag a Samsung Galaxy A51 for around $200.</p><div><h4> <strong>Also consider: OnePlus 13R</strong>   </h4><p> This mid-range device offers shockingly excellent gaming performance  without sacrificing too many of its older brother’s flagship features,  but it’ll cost a good chunk more than the Galaxy A51 as a result.  </p></div><hr><p>The best gaming phone for you will come down to your own personal needs, but hopefully, this list gives you a few options to consider. Whatever you decide to go with, happy gaming!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot Games will reportedly establish an official Game Changers circuit in League of Legends this year. The establishment of a Game Changers scene will ideally women and players representing marginalized genders a viable path to the top tier of competitive LoL.</p>



<p>After the success of the endeavor in the VALORANT space, Riot is hoping to see similar results in their flagship title, League of Legends.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-game-changers-lol-seeks-similar-success-as-valorant">Game Changers LoL Seeks Similar Success as VALORANT</h2>



<p>According to reports from both <a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-to-launch-lol-game-changers-tournament-in-2025-for-marginalized-genders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dot Esports</a> and <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-riot-to-launch-first-ever-lol-game-changers-initiative-in-emea-starting-in-april/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheep Esports</a>, Riot will establish a League of Legends Game Changers initiative in the EMEA region this year. The 2025 season will reportedly consist of two splits, with Riot also considering a LAN finals at the end of the second split.</p>



<p>Riot is reportedly looking to invite organizations that field teams in the LEC, the top European league for LoL. Both SK Gaming, G2, and Vitality currently field women’s rosters in LoL. Sheep Esports is reporting that “at least three existing LEC teams – none of which had previously invested in the [GC] scene” have explored roster options “contingent on the launch of a Game Changers initiative.” SK Gaming is also being considered as the host for online qualifiers that could begin in March.</p>



<p>In the VALORANT space, the Game Changers inititiative has been nothing short of a success. Just in the past month, two-time GC champions Shopify Rebellion became the first GC team to qualify for an official Challengers league. This occurred right after the team’s former duelist star, Ava “florescent” Eugene, became the first Game Changers player to compete in the international VCT leagues. The scene as a whole has also provided full-time competition and opportunities to its many players, and has done quite well in regards to viewership.</p>



<p>How exciting is the idea of a Game Changers scene for League of Legends?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hello-kitty-island-adventure-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I found a lot of joy in Hello Kitty Island Adventure when I first started playing its closed beta for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hello-kitty-island-adventure"><u>IGN’s guide</u></a>, way back before it hit Apple Arcade in 2023. Getting to create my own little Sanrio character and run around a tropical island collecting bits and bobs to gift to my new animal friends was pretty relaxing and fun. But day by day, that motivation to complete all my quests, find missing friends, and unlock new regions started to wear off. At a certain point it felt like a chore to log in, spam friends with gifts until I hit obnoxious daily limits, and hope I’d be allowed to progress my friendship levels a little further. Sadly, it’s the same situation on Switch and PC a year and change later: this island is still just as large, colorful, and geographically diverse as it was on my iPad, but it’s as frustratingly gated, repetitive, and stale too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty to like about Hello Kitty. The crafting, for instance, feels simple and intuitive. There are many different things you can make, from a variety of food items to cute plush pals. But at the end of the day, the main purpose of crafting is to get better gifts for your island friends. The better your gifts, the quicker you’ll advance friendship. That means there is very little incentive to craft things outside of gift giving or unlocking the next step of the very light “story.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hello Kitty Island Adventure - First Nintendo Switch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gifting is what makes the world go ‘round in Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Everything revolves around giving your island residents presents and receiving resources (which you’ll use to make better gifts) in exchange. Progression in the story is largely locked behind different Friendship levels, which can be a slog to get through unless you’re gifting your residents two- or three-heart items – but the catch is that you won’t even be able to craft those higher level items until you’ve hit certain Friendship levels. It feels like a carefully curated maze of roadblocks to keep you from progressing too far too fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although discovering the best order to level your residents while trying to figure out each of their favorite three-star gifts can be a fun challenge, gifting eventually starts to feel more like a tedious chore. You can’t even deliver multiple of the same gift at once to hurry up the process. And since gifting whatever earns you the most Friendship points is the only correct option, there’s nothing creative or rewarding about it – it’s a thinly veiled spreadsheet color-coded in bright, bubblegum pink. Even the dialogue triggered by gifting remains largely the same from friend to friend, only varying depending on the “tier” of the item you give.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The characters are super cute, but talking to them each day feels fruitless.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters themselves are super cute, and are sure to spark some nostalgia for longtime Sanrio fans. They have a bit of spunk to them, with the odd moment of humor which livens up otherwise-dull dialogue interactions. Other than that, though, talking to the island residents each day feels fruitless. You don’t really get any new interactions with them as time goes on. You just have to keep plugging along giving gift after gift to unlock their quests if you hope to see anything new or different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if Friendship and gifting are simply the keys, surely the questing door they open is where more interesting or engaging experiences must be hidden… right? Unfortunately, all that awaits you is even more flavors of busy work. From quests unlocked by reaching new levels of Friendship, to the story quests which reveal the “mystery” of the island, these objectives are another never-ending list of to-dos, with very little variety in the simple puzzles, object fetching, crafting, and more they ask of you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That means quest tasks get repetitive fast, and I had very little motivation to complete them outside of unlocking more of the story (which itself is full of dialogue that often falls flat) because rewards felt either minimal or inconsequential. We’re talking about a crafting material here, a “spooky” furniture item there – nothing that changed anything about the way the next task would unfold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because furniture and decorating are just as underwhelming as the crafting and collecting that precede them. You can decorate your own island home, plus the other homes you unlock to attract new Visitors, using the friendship and quest rewards. If you’re lucky, you might find something in a random chest hidden around the island. It’s a while, though, before you’re able to craft your own furniture.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve unlocked some variety, the options are… okay. While you <em>could </em>mix and match, the decor isn’t very versatile, leaving little room to get creative and design your own style outside of the “themes” each furniture set comes in because they just don’t play well together. What am I supposed to do with a Hello Kitty bookcase, a Spooky Candelabra, and a Pirate chair? I can’t make my house look like a bookstore, or a cafe, or even redecorate for an upcoming holiday with such limited options. Heck, you can’t even rotate furniture at quarter turns or place objects on tables! Overall, unless you like decorating your houses in full-on Kawaii styles, you’re out of luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the areas where Hello Kitty Island Adventure’s customization is more successful is its character creator. I love that you get to build your own little Sanrio character, rather than the Animal Crossing approach of you being the only human on an island full of sentient, talking creatures. There’s a nice variety of different animals to choose from, including birds, bunnies, and even sheep (though I am bewildered that it doesn’t have frogs as an option). As you play more and level up your Friendship, you unlock even more “avatar” color options to choose from.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lack of interesting hooks is why my motivation started to wane.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tuxedosam has some cute clothes available to purchase at his island shop, and you’ll get the odd outfit from a chest or quest. However, much like the decor, there isn’t enough variety to inspire my creativity or make me want to dress up every day (or even very often) like I usually enjoy doing in games like this. I found one outfit I kind of liked and it became my “uniform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This lack of interesting hooks is a big reason why my motivation to continue playing started to wane once I reached a certain point. Sure, there are lots of things to collect in Hello Kitty Island Adventure, including furniture, clothes, critters, fish, and more, but there is very little incentive to do so other than simply for the sake of keeping you busy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is at least the Nature Preserve to fill up with critters, as well as the Fwishing Well to give fish to, both of which would normally satisfy someone like me who enjoys “catching ‘em all” and hitting collection goals. But, once again, the rewards for adding these places are so minimal they might as well be nonexistent. You’re telling me that for donating all the critters that can be found in the bog area of the island I get… 10 mushrooms? I could gather those myself in a single day!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It does help that the designs for the critters themselves are unbearably adorable, branching off beyond bugs to also include frogs, chickens, and even turtles. But that’s not enough to change the fact that bug catching itself is overly simplistic, and doesn't offer much to make certain bugs more of a challenge than others besides having them vanish quicker. Of course, you can enlist Kerropi’s help to get a buff that makes the bugs stick around longer – but, as you might have guessed, this too is locked behind their Friendship level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, I really like the fishing minigame, which puts a small spin on the typical “keep the fish in the colored bar” mechanic by turning the bar on its side and testing your reaction time to keep an arrow balanced in the center. However, there isn’t much more to fishing beyond this. There are no upgrades to get and no fishing collection challenges that I could find, other than hitting certain milestones by giving gifts… sorry, I mean <em>making donations </em>to the Fwishing Well. That’s a shame, because the designs of the fish are really cute, colorful, and match the unique vibe of the regions they are found in perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point, you’ll probably be making comparisons to another cozy tropical island game. Allow me to be the bearer of bad news: No, Hello Kitty Island Adventure is not really comparable to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-for-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. While these two games might seem very similar on the surface (you are stuck on an island with some cute animal companions, tasked with sprucing the place up), they couldn’t be more different once you actually jump in.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Shailyn's Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>My go-to games for some satisfying brain-off, no-think time</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing is all about collecting and crafting as you shape your own personal dream island, essentially a sandbox decorating game full of fun little guys who live alongside you. Hello Kitty, on the other hand, is all about transforming an abandoned island amusement park into the best (read, predetermined) version of itself along a linear path. The lack of customization for not only the island itself, but also your own house and visitor’s houses, means it feels less like <em>your</em> dream island, and more like a dream of Hello Kitty’s that you’re just visiting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That makes it feel like Hello Kitty Island Adventure is asking nothing of me except for my time. While a game coming to more platforms is never a bad thing on its own, I fear this one was better off played on a phone – something to open up and fill the dull moments on long commutes or in waiting rooms. Despite the disdain mobile games often unjustly draw, there is no shame in wanting something that serves as a casual distraction for short spurts at a time. (That isn’t even to touch on the fact that many mobile games are <em>so much more</em> than that.) But even in that context, this isn’t one I want to spend my spare time on, and it makes me sad to think it could be what some people now think all cozy mobile games are: colorful, cutesy, and totally mindless.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Geoff Keighley has confirmed that the next Summer Game Fest showcase will take place on June 6.</p><p>Summer Game Fest is an annual event Keighley started in 2020 in lieu of E3. Since 2021, there has been a kickoff showcase each June, and it serves as a console-agnostic showcase where developers can announce or debut new trailers for their upcoming games. We knew that Summer Game Fest would return sometime in 2025, but we didn't have a specific date until today. Keighley confirmed all of this on X and debuted Summer Game Fest 2025's brightly colored key art.</p><p>Summer Game Fest will return on June 6, although a specific time for the showcase isn't confirmed yet. Summer Game Fest 2024 took place 2 p.m. PT on June 7, 2024. It will be livestreamed for viewers at home, but people can also attend the event in person at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles. No specific games or studios have confirmed their involvement in Summer Game Fest 2025 at this time, with Keighley simply saying that it will "showcase what’s next from the entire video game industry."</p><p>Keighley also affirmed that Summer Game Fest will once again be followed by a Play Days event for media and influencers this year. For those of you at home, the showcase on June 6 is the main thing that you should be looking forward to.</p>

            <p>
Sony has announced it's very nearly time to bid a fond farewell to those PS5 themes it released in celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary last year. But the good news is it has plans to bring them back following a "fantastic response" from players.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-30th-anniversary-ps5-update-turns-your-console-retro-for-a-limited-time">released a number nostalgia-laden PS5 themes</a> last December, featuring visuals and sounds intended to evoke memories of different console eras. There was one for PlayStation 1, PS2, PS3, and PS4, plus a theme more broadly celebrating the PlayStation brand's big three-oh.
</p>
<p>
The party, however, is almost over, with Sony having now confirmed all its limited-time anniversary themes will cease to be available from Friday, 31st January. Announcing the news on social media, it thanked fans for the "fantastic response" to the themes.

<p>
In fact, the response appears to have been good enough that Sony's had a bit of change of heart regarding the classic console themes' temporary nature. It also revealed it'll be making the designs available again "in the months ahead", just as soon as it's finished "doing some work behind the scenes" to bring them back.
</p><p>
Alongside those retro themes, PlayStation's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-30th-anniversary-celebrations-include-digital-soundtracks-and-a-board-game">30th anniversary celebrations</a> also saw the release of some strikingly designed, PS1-inspired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced">limited edition PS5s</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-to-release-free-to-play-my-first-gran-turismo-to-celebrate-playstations-30th-anniversary?view=comments">free-to-play version of Grand Turismo</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-death-stranding-and-the-last-of-us-star-in-playstations-nostalgia-fuelled-30th-anniversary-thank-you-video">nostalgia-heavy thank-you video</a>.

Amibitious romance sim Date Everything! will no longer launch on the romantic release date of 14th February, its developer has announced.
</p>
<p>
Instead, the indie couple-up sandbox is now set to arrive four months later - sometime in June.
</p>
<p>
"I was too confident that we could properly test all the wild amounto of content and pathing that exists in this massive game," lead designer Ray Chase said in a statement today, "and unfortunately we ran out of time on our current (and yet so appropriate) release date.

"Our bug list is finally starting to dwindle down as QA gets through the labyrinthine story pathing, but to submit our game in this state with so many outstanding glitches would be doing you a disservice."
</p>
<p>
In keeping with the game's claim to let you date everything, Chase mentioned that "you actually can date the glitches" - though exactly how this will work remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
This is not the first delay for Date Everything!, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-in-todays-nintendo-direct-and-indie-world-showcases">once set to arrive back in October 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
When it's finally here, you'll be able to meet and romantically greet around 100 characters, including anthropomophic versions of furniture such as bookcases and lamps, voiced by a cascade of familiar actors including Roger Craig Smith, Ashley Johnson and Neil Newbon. And yes, Henry the Hoover is also included.
</p>
<p>
Date Everything! is published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team17-parent-company-announces-name-change-but-the-worms-developers-brand-will-still-live-on">Team17, which last week announced a name change</a> - even though the veteran brand will still live on.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-adds-smooth-motion-a-driver-based-frame-generation-ai-model-for-rtx-50-gpus/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-game-ready-572-16-driver-available-rtx-5090-rtx-5080-dlss-4-support/">NVIDIA app and GeForce Game Ready driver update</a> had a lot of big stuff, like the release of DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation for 75 games and apps, the new Override functionality, and more. However, NVIDIA has also sneaked in a brand new feature they hadn't previously disclosed: Smooth Motion. Essentially, this is driver-based frame generation that owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can toggle globally or per game.</p>
<p>Here's what NVIDIA said about it:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA Smooth Motion is a new driver-based AI model that delivers smoother gameplay by inferring an additional frame between two rendered frames. For games without DLSS Frame Generation, Smooth Motion is a new option for enhancing your experience on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.</em></p>
<p><em>To enable Smooth Motion, select a compatible DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game in Graphics &gt; Program settings of NVIDIA app. Scroll down the list of options on the right to reach “Driver Settings”, and switch Smooth Motion on.</em></p>
<p><em>Smooth Motion can be applied to games running at native resolution, with super resolution technologies, or other scaling techniques, typically doubling the perceived frame rate.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This sounds like the NVIDIA equivalent of <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fluid-motion-frames-2-ai-optimization-performance-enhancements-low-latency-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMD's Fluid Motion Frames 2</a>, although, in this case, it's a full-fledged AI model, which is not surprising given the company's focus on artificial intelligence. Sure, there are already ways to inject frame generation in games that do not support it natively, like Lossless Scaling. However, we're definitely eager to check out Smooth Motion and see how well it handles frame generation across several older games. Stay tuned for our impressions.</p>
<p>Today's Game Ready driver is also optimized for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which launches in a few days with DLSS Super Resolution support, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which is out today on PC with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and Ray Tracing for ambient occlusion, shadows, and reflections. DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation will be added in a future update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel's Spider-Man 2 - Announce Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOJaeD0Si04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, there are improvements to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-video-super-resolution-out-now-testing-shows-significantly-sharper-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> as well, thanks to a more efficient AI model that NVIDIA says uses up to 30% fewer GPU resources at its highest quality setting. RTX Video Super Resolution now also upscales HDR videos, so when viewing HDR videos below your display's resolution in the browser, they will be automatically upscaled to your native display resolution.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also added a GPU Utilisation feature for RTX video when Quality is set to Auto. Setting GPU Utilization to High will use as much GPU power as necessary to provide the best quality super resolution available on the installed graphics card.</p>

			<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard developers and writers have been laid off, while BioWare continues working on the next entry in the Mass Effect series under the leadership of veterans from the original trilogy.</p>
<p>In a blog post shared <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/01/29/bioware-studio-update/">yesterday</a>, BioWare provided an update on the studio, saying that, now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been released, a core team is working under the leadership of veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, Parrish Ley, on the next Mass Effect game. At the current stage of development, BioWare doesn't need the support from the full studio, and has <em>"worked diligently over the past few months to match many of our colleagues with other teams at EA that had open roles that were a strong fit."</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this restructuring, in reality, meant layoffs. According to posts on LinkedIn and Bluesky, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/various_developers_and_writers_have_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>, writers and developers who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard at BioWare no longer work at the studio. These include Lead Writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trick Weekes</a>, Lead Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karin West-Weekes</a>, Narrative Editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, Producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Cheverie Cott</a>, Associate Game Producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7290469609919389696-Nh1q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Steed</a>, Senior Product Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lina-a-14642294_ill-write-up-a-proper-open-to-work-post-activity-7290515415674327040-ZOC6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lina Anderson</a>, and Senior Systems Designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelle Flamm</a>. Insider Gaming's Mike Straw also confirmed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1idp2wt/comment/ma0v0qx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a few dozen developers</a> were also laid off. Since Dragon Age: The Veilguard only reached 1.5 million players, missing expectations by nearly 50%, it's not too surprising that BioWare is being impacted by the game's underperformance. However, it's still disingenuous to hide these layoffs behind restructuring claims.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">review.</a></p>

Just as he was leading the charge close to the control room where everyone in the game is monitored, he has to watch his close friend Park Jung-bae (Lee Seo-hwan)—Player 390—murdered for participating in the revolt. Oh Young-il (Lee Byung-hun), originally the masked overseer of the game and known as The Front Man, ends his puzzling charade as Player 001 by killing the revolting contestants who believed him to be an ally. And now, we know a little of what happened after all of that.</p><p>In one photo, we see Gi-hun handcuffed to a bed, angrily looking up at a figure. Since The Front Man inexplicably decided to not kill Gi-hun for leading the revolt, some form of imprisonment had to be the next course of action. Another newly released photo shows Oh Young-il, whose actual name in the show is Hwang In-ho, pensively staring at The Front Man’s mask inside the cozy confines of his decadent lair. Even though he successfully stopped an insurgency, perhaps his despondence  is tied to complicated feelings with a competition he’s won in the past that still didn’t buy him the peace he sought. </p><figure id="" data-id="92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-recommend-id="image://92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-format="png" data-width="695" data-height="484" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Noh Ju-han/Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-recommend-id="image://92733b45291c34befbf00c4a90dbda50" data-format="png" data-width="695" data-height="484" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Front Man looking angry" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although splitting the final story into two seasons hurt the momentum of season 2, these small glimpses into the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> hint at all loose ends being tied up (or killed) by the time we’re done with our final binge.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Classic Themes, released on the PS5s for PlayStation’s 30th Anniversary, will be gone on January 30, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, you read that right. Today might be the last time you will see and hear the classic tune and appearance you experienced every time you booted up your PlayStation 5. However, everything is not lost, as the console maker revealed they are working “behind the scenes to bring these special designs back in the months ahead.” However, that doesn’t mean that there are “plans to create additional themes in the future.” They are just celebrating the legacy of PlayStation hardware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering, for a limited time, players could choose between multiple different themes for their PlayStation 5: 30th Anniversary, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. These themes add special effects inspired by the console generation to the homepage and during the boot-up process, creating a nostalgic impact every time you switch on your console or scroll through the games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Themes were introduced on PlayStation consoles during the PS3 and PS4 eras, and players could change the backgrounds, sounds, and icon appearances for their home screens on the fly. However, since the PS5, PlayStation has decided to use dynamic game images as backgrounds and completely dropped the idea of themes. It was nice to have them back for some time, and players hope they return soon.</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation has announced that the future of PS Plus games will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-focus-on-ps5-games-for-future-ps-plus-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on PS5 Games</a>. PC users have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-will-incentive-users-with-psn-accounts-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incentivised to use PSN accounts</a>. Also, here are this month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free PS Plus games</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a> may want to take note that there's a new third-person action-RPG that blends magic and gunplay. Nesting Games has announced The Directorate: Novitiate, a game that puts players in control of Kana Luna. By day, Kana is just a normal young woman living in Los Angeles in 2006. But by night, Kana goes by the codename Mercury while working as a magical assassin for the criminal underworld. In the first-look trailer below, Mercury uses her innate fighting and magic skills to take on human foes and otherworldly threats.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfQXCis_qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9lfQXCis_qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Mercury, Kana can upgrade her magical abilities to further refine her combat options. Mercury isn't limited to only using guns in battle, and she can incorporate spells into her offense as well. Additionally, the game will be divided between Mercury's activities after dark--including her hunt for a supernatural serial killer--and her normal life as Kana during the day.</p><p>Outside of her working hours, Kana can pursue friendships or romance with the people she meets. However, those choices may endanger Kana's loved ones when the two sides of her life collide. According to Nesting Games, players will ultimately have the option of deciding whether Mercury will stay loyal to "the Edicts of the Directorate" or if she will decide to retain her humanity as Kana. Those choices will define Mercury's portrayal in the game.</p><p>The Directorate: Novitiate can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted on Steam</a>, and early access is expected to debut later this year. For now, there's no word about whether The Directorate: Novitiate will also be available on consoles.</p>

Ubisoft had previously teased that a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/72VfO2i8dx7NAhQ2DAHNJ5/year-6-the-division-2-the-road-ahead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC set in Brooklyn</a> was in the works for Year 6 of support, but it faced a series of delays as Ubisoft focused on other aspects of the game.</p><p>As recently as January 28, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft told players</a> that the DLC would not ship during the Year 6 series of seasonal updates "to ensure we deliver the best possible experience." While that caused worry that the DLC could slip out of 2025 as well, Ubisoft took to X today, January 30, to share the first piece of key art and the title of the DLC.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Agents!

			<p>NC America has officially revealed today that Blade &amp; Soul NEO, the remaster of Blade &amp; Soul, will be available for free on February 25 on PC in North America and Europe. Those who are excited to dive into the iconic fantasy universe will be able to download the game ahead of time, with it being available to download on February 11. Then, to prepare for the full release of Blade &amp; Soul NEO, you'll be able to create and customize your character on February 18.</p>
<p>This remaster will be completely free-to-play and provides a visually elevated experience, as well as the beloved original storyline, along with new gameplay features. This includes combat upgrades, Infinite Windwalk, and more.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>To be able to jump into Blade &amp; Soul NEO early and create your character, you will need to use NCSOFT's PURPLE platform, which is where you will also pre-load the game on February 11. Then, the Character Creator will unlock on February 18, which will allow you to reserve the name of your character and then customize and style your character to your liking before jumping in on February 25.</p>
<p>For those who want to get in touch with their artistic side, there will be two competitions for Blade &amp; Soul NEO, where you can create Loading Screen art and potentially win, allowing your art to be featured as an in-game loading screen. Additionally, there is the Costume Design contest, which allows the winner to have their personally designed costume available in-game. The contests will last 30 days and will be hosted via the <a href="https://discord.gg/bladeandsoulofficial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul Discord</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to get a little extra cosmetic package in the game, you can pre-register for free on the <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/opt-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>. Additionally, there is also the option to purchase an <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive pre-order package</a>, which is currently available. To purchase the Master Package, it will set you back $59.99, giving you a full Haran Outfit and Haran Weapon Skin. You'll also get Chromatic Thread, 6,000 NCoin, and more. Alternatively, there is also the Ascendant Package, which is $29.99, and the Trainee Package, which is $9.99.</p>
<p>They all offer different rewards, which you can find out more about on the official Blade &amp; Soul website, which provides images of the rewards you will get for purchasing the packages.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/date-everything-delayed-will-no-longer-launch-on-perfect-release-date.1096095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sassy Chap Games and publisher Team17 have announced that upcoming dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, meaning it'll no longer hit what would have been its perfect release date.</p>

<p>Announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">July last year</a>, the game was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day</a>, but it's been pushed back once again. It'll now launch in June, although the two studios haven't announced a new fixed date for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>yet, ironically.</p>

<p>In a press release, lead designer Ray Chase says that while&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has reached the point at which the game is complete without the studio compromising its "bonkers artistic vision", he and Sassy Chap got "too confident" that they could test all of the game's pathways and outcomes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=jgbO_Q73 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-delayed-again-keyes.jpg?itok=AjvTviz6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>sadly won't meet its perfect release date of February 14th.</figcaption></figure><p>Chase goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>'s "bug list is finally starting to dwindle down", but that it would have been a "disservice" to release the game with "so many outstanding glitches", hence the new June release window.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, by the way, it is indeed apparently possible to date the glitches in question. Chase says "their name is Daemon" and that he's "currently in a love/hate relationship with them". I, for one, hope he's being serious.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming dating sim in which the stated aim is to allow you to, well, date everything.</p>

<p>That claim may not be entirely true, but you certainly can date a wide range of suddenly-animate objects, including your piano, your vacuum cleaner, and your overwhelming sense of existential dread.</p>




<p>The game promises 100 dateable objects, full voice acting, and branching narratives. With that many characters, I'm not surprised extra development time was needed to make sure they all made sense.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in June for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Anthem Animated Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer mainly focuses on Octane as he battles his way through a match, but we also see what Legends like Alter and Loba get up to between matches: Loba steals stuff, and Alter terrorizes her interdimensional enemies. But a crowd of spectators and fans are also featured in the trailer, with many of them cosplaying as their favorite Legend.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Octane nearly bites the dust, but comes out on top with a narrow victory. The crowd goes wild, and the trailer cuts to a shot of Titanfall 2 big bad Kuben Blisk, who also serves as the official Apex Games commissioner. Blisk looks especially pleased with himself, as if Octane's win might be something he was hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that's notably missing from the trailer is a new Legend. The trailer shows off plenty of familiar faces, but so far, it doesn't look like Season 24 will come with a new playable Legend.</p><p>Although the trailer does provide the name of Season 24 (Takeover), it doesn't provide any details on when the season will launch. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/takeover" rel="nofollow ">Season 24 page</a> on the official Apex Legends website simply reads, "We live to fight," followed by a promise that more details are coming next week. The end of the animated trailer says that a gameplay trailer is coming soon, but doesn't provide a specific date for the trailer or the launch of Season 24, though the new season is likely set to launch in early February.</p>
