<p>Is that... Mr. Biffo?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> for the Switch, and to celebrate its arrival, a new launch trailer has hit the web, and it's a <em>doozy</em>.</p>
<p>The live-action trailer stars none other than Paul Rose, who served as the editor for <strong>The Digitiser</strong>, a video games magazine for Teletext back in the '90s and early '00s. You might know him best as Mr. Biffo, and his short appearance here is undeniable.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, we've got a small cameo from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Stick</a> at the beginning, while the rest is a nostaligia-filled look at the classic R-Type gameplay, remastered for the Switch. It's looking slick with smooth visuals and 60fps gameplay, and we can't wait to dive in.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The year is 2163, and the badly damaged R9 Arrowhead fighter has just returned to Earth after its mission to destroy the Bydo Empire. The vessel is rescued by the battle-cruiser Croque-Monsieur and transported to an orbital space station. One year later, astronomers in Central Asia observe mysterious objects falling from the sky, and moments later, control is lost over the orbiting annihilation platform Moritz-G. This high-tech machine, capable of destroying the entire planet, descends over a city and levels it to the ground. Although its planet-destroying weapons have not yet been activated, its advanced defense systems make Moritz-G virtually impossible to approach. A desperate military operation is launched, and the prototype ship R9aII Delta is deployed to resolve the situation. Thus begins the epic battle that is R-Type Delta!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic and Tarsier Studios have settled on a release date for their co-op horror platformer, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/reanimal">Reanimal</a>, settling on Friday, 13th February 2026.</p>
<p>The game is coming from the creators of Little Nightmares I &amp; II, and it sticks with their particular penchant for dark and unsettling imagery and creatures tormenting small people. In this game a brother and sister have to try and go through this hell to rescue missing friends and escape an island they once called home.</p>


<p>Pre-orders are now open across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and today also sees the release of a demo for the game on consoles (already available on PC) for fans to try out. The co-op demo starts at the beginning of the game, reuniting the protagonists and presenting you early environments at the Mill and the Trainyard to play through.</p>
<p>The demo is also coming to Switch 2 at a later date, and pre-orders for Nintendo’s handheld will be on hold until then.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-and-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-top-us-sales-charts-for-october-2025.1359328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has released the latest monthly charts for US video game sales for October 2025, and the two games at the top of the charts are the two games you would have expected to be there: Battlefield 6 and Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Those were the top two games, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> in first place and Pokémon Legends Z-A in second, though it's worth remembering that Nintendo doesn't share its digital sales data with any of the big analytics firms, Circana included, which means that on physical sales alone, it had a stronger month than 18 other games, some of them new releases, some of them sales-charts-topping regulars like EA Sports FC 26 and NBA 2K26.</p>



<p>It also could mean that, were digital sales properly included, Pokémon Legends Z-A might have been listed as the actual best-selling premium game in the US for October 2025. But we can't know its digital sales, so that crown goes to Battlefield 6.</p>







<p>Number one on the sales charts for the month of October in the US isn't the only crown Battlefield 6 is walking away with, as it also launched right to the top of the list for best-selling premium games in the US in 2025 so far.</p>



<p>According to Piscatella, not only did Battlefield 6 become the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, it also "<em>produced the highest single month US physical and digital full game tracked dollar sales total in three years. The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October 2022</em>."</p>







<p>It's all coming up roses for Battlefield 6 on the commercial front, but it's one month away from perhaps the biggest victory it could hope for, which would be maintaining its top spot over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November 2025 sales numbers are in.</p>



<p>Of course, we'll have to wait a while for those numbers, but for now, Battlefield 6 can bask in its top spot for the month, for the year, and in the history of the franchise. Also, it's worth noting that while Battlefield 6 may be the best-selling game in the US in 2025 so far, when it comes to exclusively physical sales, the best-selling game in the US so far is Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Other notable elements of the list include <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">September 2025's best-selling game in the US</a> dropping all the way to the tenth best-selling game, with Borderlands 4 going from the top spot to halfway down the top-20 list.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 was also able to squeeze into the top-10 in seventh place, just ahead of another new release, Little Nightmares III, which made the list in eighth place. Ninja Gaiden 4, another big new release for October 2025, made the top-20 list, but not the top-10, as it fell just outside the top-10 in eleventh place. </p>



<p>On the hardware side of things, the Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be the best-selling console, though what's more impressive is how far ahead it is compared to Nintendo Switch sales for the same time period of its launch year. "<em>It is 68% ahead of the sales pace set by the original Nintendo Switch and is 3% ahead of PlayStation 4's previous record velocity</em>," writes Piscatella.</p>



<p>Another notable hardware tidbit is that spending on ASUS PC portable hardware saw a 4.8x spike led by he release of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. You can find out more about both devices in <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">my interview with ASUS executives last month,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">in my review of the ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, October 2025 was a strong month for video game sales in the US. It saw a 3% growth over October 2024, and included a couple of the year's best-selling games so far. However, the real bout of the year for US sales is currently happening right now, between Call of Duty and Battlefield, with both games officially out and available for players to buy. We'll see which game ends up at the top of the charts for November 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans of AMD’s GPUs, which are typically more cost-effective than those made by Nvidia, might be in for some sticker shock in the near future. Team Red is likely to start raising the price of its goods. And unfortunately, there’s a chance this will affect more than just your graphics card.</p> <p>As <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-rumored-to-raise-gpu-prices-just-as-radeon-rx-9070-xt-finally-reaches-msrp">reported by <i>VideoCardz</i></a>, AMD has informed its partners of an impending price hike for its GPUs. Last month the company reportedly adjusted prices for its corporate partners to reflect changes in the market, though it managed to save retail customers from the shift. This time around, however, retail prices are likely to get hit. The culprit? Well, if you’ve been paying attention to the price fluctuations of computer components, you may already know: the cost of DRAM components, which provide the memory for computers and other electronics, is going up as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-hikes-memory-chip-prices-by-up-60-shortage-worsens-sources-say-2025-11-14/">the AI industry</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/wM8LDVIiwhA">wolfs down</a> the earth.</p>

 <p>And if you’re familiar with what goes inside consoles like the PS5 and Xbox Series machines, or even the upcoming Steam Machine, then you know AMD chips power those too.</p> <p>Retail prices haven’t gone up just yet, but the prospect is frustrating.Sure, PC gaming has always been more expensive than just grabbing the latest Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo box and plugging it in, but it’s continued to get worse. And given the central role AMD plays in all of these devices, PC gamers aren’t the only ones likely to get a haircut.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only-2000645733</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nordvpn-is-almost-free-on-black-friday-now-selling-at-77-off-for-us-customers-only.1359313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>NordVPN just launched its Black Friday deal this morning</strong> on November 20th and matches Amazon’s Black Friday kickoff with aggressive pricing of its own: The NordVPN <em>Basic</em> plan <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/">dropped to a record low of $2.99 per month when you commit to 27 months, which works out to $80.73 total instead of the usual $312.93</a>.</p>
<p>VPN services protect your internet privacy, encrypt your connection and let you access content that’s geographically restricted, but most people skip them because monthly costs add up quickly. This <strong>Black Friday pricing makes premium VPN protection cost less than a fancy coffee each month</strong>, and you<strong> get three extra months</strong> thrown in on top of the two-year commitment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<h2>What NordVPN Does for Your Daily Internet Use</h2>
<p>NordVPN <strong>encrypts all the data that travels between your device and the internet</strong> which prevents your internet service provider, government agencies, or hackers on public Wi-Fi from seeing what you are doing online. Normally, your ISP tracks every website you visit and can sell that data to advertisers or hand it over to authorities without your knowledge. The encryption forms a security tunnel that scrambles your traffic into unreadable code and anyone intercepting it sees only gibberish instead of your passwords, bank details, or browsing history.</p>
<p>The service<strong> works by masking your actual IP address</strong> and routing your connection through NordVPN’s servers in the country of your choice. Websites and online services will see the VPN server’s IP address instead of your own, effectively blocking them from tracking your physical location or compiling deeply detailed profiles of what you do online. Based on where you choose, you could appear to browse from within the UK, Japan or anywhere else NordVPN has servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordVPN</a></p>
<p>NordVPN currently operates <strong>more than 6,000 servers across 111 countries</strong> which builds the required structure for fast and reliable connections, no matter where you are located or through which region you connect. The distributed server network allows one to always find a nearby server that will impact your speed very little, or connect to distant servers when you need to access specific regional content. Based in Panama, this country has no obligatory data retention laws: It’s also outside of international agreements, including Five Eyes surveillance. In this context, <strong>NordVPN can follow its strict no-logs policy</strong> without any government pressure to capture user data.</p>
<p>For $2.99 per month, the <em>Basic</em> plan will get you the core VPN functionality: secure, fast connections, and the ability to use the service on up to 10 devices simultaneously. Protect your laptop, phone, and tablet, or configure your router to lock down every device on your home network with a single VPN connection. <strong>The 30-day money-back guarantee</strong> lets you try out the service completely risk-free, and you’ll receive a full refund if it doesn’t meet your needs. You’ll save 74% compared to paying month-to-month, and the total cost for 27 months plus those three bonus months drops to just $80.73.</p>
<p>NordVPN Plus plan jumps to $3.89 per month and adds anti-malware protection, ad blocking, tracker blocking and a password manager with breach scanner. Complete at $4.89 monthly includes everything in Plus plan plus scam call protection and 1TB of encrypted cloud storage. Prime plan at $6.89 monthly adds NordProtect identity protection with cyber crime monitoring and insurance coverage.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-solo-4-headphones-2000645533</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-turns-beats-solo-4-into-apple%E2%80%99s-cheapest-headphone-for-black-friday.1359310/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good headphones that offer solid sound quality, have a reliable battery life, and are comfortable to wear for an extended period are hard to find. And when you do find a pair that offers all this, the price tag isn’t always the most friendly. In fact, most such options sit well over $250.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that’s not the case today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">Amazon, like most other retailers, is offering plenty of impressive early Black Friday discounts you can score ahead of the event.</a> It has also dropped the price of the top-rated Beats Solo 4 by 35%! Normally, these would run you around $200, but you can now grab them for just $130. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this pair go for in a long time, and the offer applies to all color options. Looking for something minimal? The matte black version looks stunning. Want something with a bit more personality to it? Pink and blue color options are just as heavily discounted. Just note that, like most other big discounts, this one won’t be around for long. If you have been wanting to grab a premium pair without spending a ton, now is the time to act.</p>
<p>Add the product to your cart, and the discount will apply automatically; no coupon codes or complicated procedures to worry about!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Pulls You In</h2>
<p>These headphones feature a premium design. The overall build is super lightweight, and the headband folds down safely when not in use. This means the pair doesn’t take up much space in bags; just fold it, toss it in, and you’re good to go. They are also quite comfortable to wear, thanks to the UltraPlush ear cushions that fit nicely and stay in place throughout the day. You can wear them for hours while travelling, streaming, or gaming without feeling uneasy.</p>
<p>Powerful sound is made possible with a custom acoustic architecture and updated drivers that deliver the brand’s signature sound. Expect rich, deep audio, whether you’re listening to a podcast, vibing to your favorite songs, or winding down after a long day with some relaxing music. These also support spatial audio with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive, surround-sound experience, which pulls you in. This mode makes it feel like you’re part of whatever’s playing, in real-time, from concerts to action-packed movies.</p>



<p>Best of all, plugging in via USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable lets you stream in a format that preserves the original quality of any recording; perfect for when you want to experience a more detailed texture in your music. Calls get a boost, too. The upgraded microphones are smart enough to automatically reject background noise (chatter, laughter, traffic) on your end while precisely targeting your voice. You can attend meetings and catch up with friends even in busy cafes and chaotic subways!</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last up to 50 hours on a full charge. That’s more than enough to go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging the pair in. Recharging is fast, as well, and you can get an additional five hours of listening with just a quick 10-minute top-up. Compatibility-wise, the Beats Solo 4 work well with both Android and iOS devices. Pairing them with smartphones, tablets, computers, and more hardly takes a few minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The pair is now down to $130, which makes grabbing these quite affordable right now.</a> The discount could wrap up soon, however, which is why it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time. All color options are discounted, so you can grab the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

              <p>Homer will break new ground in <em>Fortnite</em>: his underpants version will blast its nips, unlike every previous bare-chested skin before it. It’s all seemingly part of the next beat in the battle royale’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-fortnite-homer-mascots-santa-monica-2000645254">ongoing <em>Simpsons</em> mini-season</a>.</p> <p>While a giant naked Homer was shown off in the latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buwIZkFuBA0">Multiplidiocy</a>” animated trailer this week, the actual giant Homer skin <a href="https://twitter.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1991097774012797411%7Ctwgr%5E6b2bc80873737b841841aee64dc4d0c99c09bc95%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fleaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples%2F1100-6536357%2F">has also leaked</a> ahead of its introduction to the game, confirming the existence of nipples. Casual fans might be thinking, “So what? I’ve seen Homer’s nipples dozens of times before.” Yes, yes you have. We all have. But not in <em>Fortnite</em>, a game which has famously refused to put nipples on character skins until now.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-underwear-homer-would-be-first-fortnite-skin-with-nipples/1100-6536357/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">As <em>GameSpot</em> points out</a>, a shirtless Travis Scott performed nipple-less in<em> Fortnite</em> way back in 2019. Bare-chested skins for Castaway Jonesy, Menace, TheGrefg, Raz, Dude, and others all had their nipples nerfed as well. Kong was not immune. Neither was Avatar’s Aang. Even Drax and Blanka had their glands removed.

Is he just more cartoony than the others, and so Epic Games is less squeamish about adding a pair of dots to his cel-shaded character model? Or is this the company dipping its first toe into the pond, with more realistic anatomy to eventually follow for other characters?</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/here-are-a-bunch-of-other-video-game-nipples-1818495101">Other companies</a> haven’t shied away from adding nipples to lots of other cartoon-y video game characters. Sora from <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> had nipples all the way back in the PS2-era, when they probably took all week to animated and half the RAM to render. Even Nintendo bravely <a href="https://kotaku.com/marios-supposed-to-be-cute-which-is-why-his-nipples-gr-1828557226">let&nbsp;Mario’s nips go free</a> in <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, though it has <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-it-seems-has-removed-marios-nipples-1844723285">occasionally censored them</a> in other contexts.</p> <p>It’s nice to see Epic Games finally catching up.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s <em>Simpsons</em> season is set to end on November 28, so it probably won’t be long until whatever final showdown Epic has planned with giant naked Homer goes into effect. That’s likely when the new skin will drop. After that, well, the company is already trying to get fans hyped for its next big Hollywood takeover: <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-kill-bill-yukis-revenge-lost-chapter-tarantino-2000645687"><em>Kill Bill</em></a>.</p>

<p>Reanimal is releasing on February 13, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p>



<p>Tarsier Studios announced their upcoming title, Reanimal, at Gamescom Opening Night <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarsier-studios-new-game-reanimal-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>, with a trailer that got many players excited. The developers are also experienced in this space, bringing players the first two Little Nightmare games and LittleBigPlanet 3. </p>







<h2 id="h-reanimal-release-date-set-for-february-13-2026-pre-orders-are-live">Reanimal Release Date Set for February 13, 2026; Pre-Orders Are Live</h2>



<p>The release date for Reanimal was spotted by Shinobi602 on <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1991512993218326945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The release date announcement also comes with other news: first, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S demos for the title will go live today. Secondly, pre-orders for Reanimal are live as well, with the bonus being exclusive Foxhead &amp; Muttonhead masks. Digital Deluxe edition buyers will get a Season Pass for all 3 DLC chapters along with the pre-order bonus. </p>



<p>Reanimal is a co-op horror-adventure where players experience the story of a brother and sister who set foot in hell to save their friends. The region the players explore is filled with tension and a thick atmosphere as they traverse by boat and on land. Exploration is key, as the main path is only one part of the story, with many mysterious locations and their own stories to tell. The title is fully playable in single player and local &amp; online co-op, it also has “a shared, directed camera, designed to maximise claustrophobia and tension.”</p>

<p>Looking at the rest of the top five games, Pokémon Legends Z-A came in second followed by Ghost of Yotei, NBA 2K26, and EA Sports FC 26 at No. 3-5, respectively.

                <p>Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and didn't need much time to become 2025's best-selling game overall in the US based on dollar sales. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wlx7h2s2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana released its latest monthly report today</a>, confirming that Battlefield 6 was October 2025's No. 1 best-selling game and, after just three weeks on sale, became the No. 1 best-selling game of 2025 for physical and digital sales.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is also the No. 1 best-selling game on the Xbox and PC charts for 2025, while it ranks No. 2 for 2025 on PlayStation (second only to NBA 2K26).</p><p>EA's new Battlefield game also became the best-selling game in Battlefield franchise history in the US for its first month. 2018's Battlefield 1 was the previous record-holder, and in fact, the first-month sales volume for Battlefield 6 has surpassed the lifetime sales of Battlefield 1.</p><p>Outside of the Battlefield franchise, Circana confirmed that Battlefield 6 had the highest one-month US and physical full-game dollar sales for any game in the past three years. Not since 2022's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II did any game generate more first-month physical and digital full-game dollar sales. This would seem to mean that the first-month sales of Battlefield 6 were higher than 2024's Black Ops 6, 2023's Modern Warfare III, and every other game since 2022, except Modern Warfare II.</p><p>A key point to consider in this comparison is that Black Ops 6 was the first game to launch into Xbox Game Pass--this was apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">massively negative for direct sales of the game</a>. Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and in a break from tradition, Activision's celebratory first-weekend post <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any data about how the game is performing</a> compared to past games. Before this, Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-does-worry-about-fatigue-as-black-ops-7-arrives-right-after-black-ops-6/1100-6535019/" data-ref-id="1100-6535019">acknowledged "fatigue" around the Black Ops brand given the back-to-back releases of Black Ops 7 in 2024 and Black Ops 7 in 2025. </a></p><p>A significant caveat to be aware of here is that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wm7vqdq2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo does not participate in Circana's tracking</a>. Circana previously announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-the-biggest-physical-game-launch-in-years-in-us/1100-6535737/" data-ref-id="1100-6535737">Pokemon Legends: Z-A had the biggest physical game launch in years in the US.</a></p><p>So far, EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">Battlefield 6 sold 7 million copies out of the gate</a>. An industry analyst said that figure later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">grew to 10 million</a>, though EA has not confirmed this.</p><p>Many are wondering if Battlefield 6 is selling well enough to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year. That remains to be seen, and many will be looking to Circana's November report coming in December for more information. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

The game also focuses on the bond between humans and their Digimon, and Time Stranger improved on the traditional turn-based combat systems for this new release.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Four words I did not expect to hear from former Xbox 360 boss Peter Moore when we spoke recently were: "I was Ken Kutaragi." As in, Ken Kutaragi, the widely acknowledged 'father of PlayStation' - the engineer and businessman who designed the original PlayStation consoles and led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sony-computer-entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>, until Kaz Hirai took over later in the PlayStation 3 era. But those four words were the words Peter Moore said.</p>
<p>He was referring to a role he played shortly before Xbox 360 launched, when Microsoft executives tried to put themselves in Sony's shoes, so to speak, and figure out what the company's plans were for PlayStation 3 - the console they'd be up against. This involved closing themselves away in a hotel room and pretending they were Sony executives coming up with a PS3 plan.</p>
<p>"We spent three days war-gaming prior to the launch of Xbox 360 pretending to be the other guy to understand what we needed to do," Peter Moore told me in part two of a large Xbox 360-related interview.</p>
<p>"I was Ken Kutaragi, and I took the role of PlayStation and what would I do? This was a fascinating process where we war-gamed; locked ourselves in a hotel conference room for two, nearly three days, if I recall, and played out scenarios almost like it's in the Situation Room [in the White House] and we're figuring out… And it surfaced some of the strategies and tactics that we then deployed which became successful for us."</p><p>That Xbox 360 era for Microsoft was characterised by Moore and his fierce challenger-brand mentality, in which Xbox took the fight to PlayStation in order to chip away at its dominant market share - which it did. This involved securing huge licenses for the platform, such as Grand Theft Auto 4, and stoking the fires of what we now know as the console war. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-was-brought-in-to-start-throwing-punches-veteran-exec-peter-moore-reflects-on-the-particular-set-of-talents-microsoft-needed-to-make-xbox-360-challenge-playstation-3">As Moore said in a story we wrote yesterday, he was brought in especially to "start throwing punches"</a>.</p>
<p>But play with fire and you might get burnt. "If you're going to stick your chin out you're going to get punched," said Moore. "I got a lot of abuse, a lot of criticism. Still do, to this day, all the way back to the Sega days. People will sometimes write vile things."</p>
<p>Moore famously also launched the Dreamcast at Sega, a beloved console that also resulted in Sega backing out of the console hardware business. And some people blame Moore for that - still. "I celebrate nine, nine, ninety-nine every year, the launch of the Dreamcast, and I do it because it was an amazing time in my life personally and I worked with so many great people," he told me. "I still think the Dreamcast broke some barriers and it passed the baton to Xbox, bluntly, to build Xbox Live. There was SegaNet before there was Xbox Live.</p>
<p>"But there's this internet myth that somehow I killed the Dreamcast, or I used the Dreamcast as a career stepping stone to go to Microsoft, and nothing could be further than the truth. But I will - even this last time, September 9th of 2025 - still get comments from people, who I think are old enough to know better now, of just disgusting personal attacks."</p>
<p>Perhaps that's the price of leadership, he mused. And he's hardened to it. He's had to; after all, he spent years leading EA. "And nobody took - and still takes - more abuse than EA," he said. "Fine.</p>
<p>"But people don't know what it takes to bring a game to market, to create these things. How much love and sweat and tears go into creating these magnificent interactive experiences. It's always a shame; I always feel actually sorry for the people who feel compelled to type these letters on a keyboard, personally attacking developers and publishers and going after people. It's kind of sad."</p><p>Peter Moore has since moved on from video games. Most notably, he was CEO of Liverpool Football Club for three years, highlighting his lifelong passion for sports and in particular football. He now owns a football  (soccer) team in America, part-owns a football team in Poland, and advises the football club that actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney took over a few years back: Wrexham. All of this - his whole career - he recently put down on the pages of <a href="https://www.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/book/10.3828/9781836245797">an autobiographical book called Game Changer, which has just been released</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">Parts one</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-how-peter-moore-and-microsoft-made-xbox-360-a-cultural-phenomenon-the-big-xbox-360-interview-continued">part two of our big Peter Moore Xbox 360 interview</a> are both now available on the site to read.</p>

            <p>
We already knew the Xbox Series X/S version of last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was likely imminent thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/esrb-rating-confirms-silent-hill-2-remake-is-finally-on-the-way-to-xbox-consoles">recent ratings board sightings</a>, but it turns out the wait is already over - for Australian players at least. It's available to download right now via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-au/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV">Australian Xbox Store</a>, suggesting a global launch announcement will feature during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-for-later-this-week-focused-on-third-party-games">tonight's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>
<p>
Developed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> (the studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> and this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>), the Silent Hill 2 remake initially launched as PlayStation 5 console exclusive in October last year, arriving on PC at the same time. It was a good 'un too, successfully managing to modernise the 2001 survival horror classic without losing any of the qualities that helped make the affecting original one of the most beloved games of all time.

<p>
Both the original and Bloober's remake follow protagonist James Sunderland as he journeys to the titular town after receiving a message from his dead wife. Soon the fog closes in and all manner of horrors begin to reveal themselves. "It doesn't matter if you've never played Silent Hill 2 before," Eurogamer contributor (and Silent Hill super-fan) Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">wrote in her five-star review</a> of the remake last year. "It also doesn't matter if you have. [The] heady blend of old and new delivers the best horror I've played for years... How it looks, how it sounds, how it plays, how it iterates and modernises whilst honouring its cherished source material. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is as close to perfect as I could have ever hoped. And my hopes were high, my friend."
</p><p>
Which is to say Xbox Series X/S owners have been missing out on a stellar horror experience. But if today's perhaps unintentionally early Australian release is any indication, that wait will soon be over for all players. Better still, the Australian release (which comes in both standard and deluxe edition forms) is listed with a massive 50 percent discount, meaning Xbox players can get a brilliant game at a fantastic price. Presumably, the remake was initially set to shadow-drop during tonight's third-party focused Xbox Partner Showcase, but scheduling mishaps with the Australian release has spoiled the surprise. 
</p>
<p>
All this does at least mean Xbox Series X/S owners will get to enjoy the Silent Hill 2 remake ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-receives-teaser-trailer-for-film-adaptation-revealing-pyramid-head-and-release-date">next year's movie adaptation</a>, Return to Silent Hill, which is being directed by Christophe Gans, who helmed the original Silent Hill movie back in 2006. Will it be any good? I'm apprehensive, but after Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and this year's brilliant Silent Hill f, the series is clearly on a bit of a roll. Speaking of Silent Hill f, it's great stuff despite some big changes, and its fascinating approach to story telling even sold me on New Game Plus - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time">no other game has managed in 40 years</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One week on from the big content update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, adding the new Stella Montis map and more to the game, Embark Studios has released the ARC Raiders 1.3.0 update, focussing on bug fixes, balance changes, and with a little surprise for good measure.</p>
<p>There’s a few nerfs here, which Embark will need to be rather cautious in leaning on too heavily, as demonstrated by many previous multiplayer games. From the PvP angle, the Venator has been chewing through other players at close range, so its fire rate upgrades have been dropped significantly. Meanwhile, PvE focused players will be disappointed by the explosive damage nerf, which Embark felt was hitting too many parts of larger enemies and making things like the Hullcracker too effective – which you’d want it to be, given how awesome that name is.</p>


<p>Beyond that, it’s mainly bug fixes – stopping ARCs from going outside of maps, fixing a few crashes, and the like.</p>
<p>here’s the full ARC Raiders 1.3.0 patch notes:</p>






<p><b>Deadline</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy value: From 8,100 to 15,000 Coins<wbr></li>
<li>Sell value: From 3,000 to 5,000 Coins<wbr></li>
<li>Crafting:<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old: 2 Explosive compound + 1 Synthesized fuel<wbr></li>
<li>New: 3 Explosive compound + 2 ARC Circuitry&nbsp;<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deadline trader stock: From 3 to 1<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Power cell</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sell value: From 640 to 270 Coins<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Launcher ammo</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy value:<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old: 10 launcher ammo for 6,000 Coins<wbr></li>
<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 4,500 Coins<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sell value: From 200 to 250<wbr></li>
<li>Crafting:<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Old: 6 launcher ammo for 4 Metal parts + 1 Explosive Compound<wbr></li>
<li>New: 6 launcher ammo for 1 ARC Motion Core + 2 Crude Explosives<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launcher ammo crafting is available at the Workbench without needing a blueprint.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Venator</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note: </b>The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons. We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced Fire-rate gained from upgrades from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Weight from 2 to 5.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Explosive Damage</b><wbr></p>
<p><em><b>Dev note:</b> We noticed that explosives dealt damage to more parts at once than intended, allowing weapons like the Hullcracker to kill larger drones too quickly. We’ve adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change. This will require Hullcracker shots to need a bit more precision while still dealing good damage to the targeted spot.</em><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Rebalanced explosive damage against ARC for a more consistent experience.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on smaller enemies, e.g. Turrets are largely unaffected.<wbr></li>
<li>Explosions on larger sized enemies, e.g. Bastion will typically deal a bit less damage.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<hr>



<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where ARC could call down reinforcements outside the map.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Shredder will now detect and move more reliably towards Lure Grenades.<wbr></li>
<li>Shredder movement and handling updated: slightly reduced turn speed, improved braking, stiffer suspension, and more consistent reactions to impacts for steadier behavior in combat.<wbr></li>
<li>Improved Shredder navigation to prevent it from getting stuck on corners when moving toward the player.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduced volume attenuation for explosion tinnitus and concussion effects to improve clarity.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Barricades can no longer be placed overlapping your character, preventing clipping through walls and access to locked rooms.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dam Battlegrounds</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would get stuck in the Dam Control Tower elevator shaft.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Spaceport</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Added collision to the staircase walls and ceiling in the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could enter the wall near the Launch Tower ramp on Spaceport, preventing unfair ambushes.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could access the locked room on the Control Tower without a key.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Blue Gate</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed railing props on Blue Gate that mistakenly blocked bullets; shots now pass through as expected.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Stella Montis</b><wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a collision issue on Stella Montis near the Train Station that could cause players to fall through the terrain.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a location in Stella Montis Train Station where players could get stuck.<wbr></li>
<li>Removed two player spawns on Stella Montis that were too close to ARC spawn areas.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed missing visibility collision on walls in the Business Center area of Stella Montis that allowed shots to pass through.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using Raider Voice (proximity chat) on PCs without AVX2 support.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when surrendering after reconnecting to a session.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where scavenging parts from the Shredder could leave behind invisible collisions.<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Trials weekly rollover could display an outdated rank; the celebration now reflects the correct current rank and the UI remains accurate during the cooldown period.<wbr></li>
<li>Updated recommended AMD graphics driver to version 25.11.1 to reduce recent crash issues on AMD GPUs.<wbr></li>
<li>Your Raider Den has been ducked out.<wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved enemy ground detection to better handle steep surfaces, reducing erratic movement when traversing angled terrain.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Aphelion<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where Aphelion tracers could become excessively bright at distance, reducing visibility for the player being shot at.<wbr></li>
<li>Increased Aphelion blueprint drop rates.<wbr></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stitcher<wbr>
<ul>
<li>Corrected player facing stats for the Stitcher, showing incorrect scaling of reload time across upgrade levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone within the game's first week on sale.</p>

<p>As announced on social media,&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1991397741881356657" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 500,000 sales</a> across all of the platforms on which it's currently available. Given that it's a niche soccer RPG, that's a pretty impressive number for the game's first seven days.</p>

<p>The figure puts&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>game in some pretty illustrious company as well; it's sold the same amount as indie hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">"anxiety horror"&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">cozy RPG&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=NvsFBLDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-sales-500k-match.jpg?itok=8TIT053i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>has sold half a million copies since launching last week.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>is Level-5's second major hit this year, following the release of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>back in May.</p>

<p>That game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up half a million sales</a> in its first week as well, and it went on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">pass the million mark</a> before a month had elapsed, so here's hoping that the studio's latest will achieve the same result as well.</p>

<p>It's certainly been a long and strange journey for&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em>. The game was announced all the way back in 2016 under the name&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven Ares</em>,&nbsp;and in the years between then and now, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-heroes-great-road-delayed-until-2021" rel="nofollow">delayed numerous times</a>, receiving a couple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-will-come-west-new-trailer-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">name changes</a> along the way.</p>

<p>This is the latest title in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>series, and it follows the journey of new protagonists Destin Billows and Harper Evans, with a story taking place a quarter of a century after the events of the first game.</p>




<p>If you're interested in seeing where that lengthy journey ended up, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/231308" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/inazuma-eleven-victory-road/9nvx87zg7wsc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950552.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/INAZUMA-ELEVEN-Victory-Road-2950387.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch</a>.</p>

              <p>LEGO make for wonderful gifts during the holidays. The catalog of sets LEGO offers is unthinkably vast, ranging from capturing memorable moments across our favorite media like that of Star Wars or Marvel all the way to simple sets aimed more at adults designed for display. Think those LEGO flower bouquets every slightly nerdy millennial has in their living rooms. This set here leans a little closer to the latter. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">LEGO has a buildable cat on sale right now for 20% off. Not just any cat—a tuxedo cat.</a> This will make the perfect gift for any tuxedo cat owner this upcoming holiday. They’ll put it together and think, “it looks just like Tux!” (every tuxedo cat owner seems to name theirs Tux for some reason. Well anyway, right now this 20% discount will end up shaving $20 off the standard $100 price tag. That brings it down to just $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Holiday Gift for Cat Owners</h2>
<p>This lifelike LEGO cat model is built to actual size, standing over 12.5 inches tall and made from 1,710 pieces to bring to life its distinctive black fur and white underbelly. It makes a wonderful gift for anyone with a passion for animals, art, or design, but especially for cat owners. Particularly those who own a tuxedo cat themselves.</p>
<p>The set is interactive. The cat’s features are all adjustable so you can display yours to your liking. Rotate the head or adjust the ears, paws and tail. You can even reconfigure the cat to have it’s mouth be open or closed. And yes, when it’s open, there is a little pink piece in there so you cat can blep.</p>



<p>Even the eyes are swappable. The set comes with a pair of yellow eyes in addition to a pair of blue eyes, so you can make it match your own cat. Or go for the stunning heterochromia look with one yellow and one blue.</p>
<p>The LEGO Builder app can help make the build even easier. View each step with a 3D digital version so you can get a better look at some of those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet. You can zoom in and rotate the model around even bookmark your progress so you can walkaway and come back later to complete your build.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5736/">Ahead of Black Friday, you can grab this tuxedo cat for display from LEGO for a solid $20 off over at Amazon.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-tarkov-endings-cost-you-6-2-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-endings-will-cost-you-6-2-million.1359238/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is now a fully released game, with Battlestate having pushed out the 1.0 version of the popular extraction shooter on November 15. One of the biggest selling points of the new version is that it has a story that players can work through to attain one of four endings, all of which are notoriously difficult to reach.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, one Escape from Tarkov creator revealed that they’d reached one of those endgame scenarios, and that getting out and escaping from Tarkov via that particular route was going to cost them a whopping <strong>500 million rubles</strong>, which is around $6.2 million.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-s-endings-are-nails">Escape from Tarkov’s Endings Are Nails</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, warned that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-story-will-have-four-endings/">only a small percentage</a> of Escape from Tarkov players would ever successfully reach the game’s ultimate ending. The four endings that have been set up mark a major milestone for the extraction shooter, but many of the game’s fans won’t see them.</p>



<p>We now know why.</p>



<p>In an image uploaded on social media by Tigz, a popular Tarkov creator, it was revealed that one of those endings requires the player to hand over a whopping 500 <strong>million rubles</strong>, which is a staggering, dizzying amount of cash. It’s equivalent to $6.2 million, and the player will need to acquire those funds while spending on everything required to… Well, <em>acquire those funds</em>.</p>

<p>For the average player, this ending is almost impassable and unobtainable, as making that much money in Escape from Tarkov takes an immense amount of time, even if you’re a skilled player.</p>



<p>The point of Escape from Tarkov now is to be much more persistent, so it’s probably doable, but it’s a monumental grind that will wear most players down to the bone.</p>







<p>In the comments under the post, some users joked about the objective. One noted that it would be ‘Just a couple thousand good Scav runs.’ While another criticized it, writing, ‘Not even a fun quest or anything, just grinding, what a disappointment.’</p>



<p>Do you think you could stump up half a billion rubles to get out of Tarkov? Let the community know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you could.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An F1 collab is speeding its way into Fortnite, giving the community a chance to immortalise another of the world’s most popular franchises. If you’re wheelie excited about this high-octane crossover, the official release date for the Fortnite and F1 content crossover is below and waiting in the pit lane.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s collaboration possibilities are endless. We’re not at the end of Chapter 6 yet, and we’ve already gotten wind of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Battle Pass leak, revealing Back to the Future content</a>! Before we get there, though, it’s time to take this to the track.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the F1 Skins release date in Fortnite, and what’s coming.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-f1-skins-release-date">Fortnite &amp; F1 Skins Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Full gear. Credit to Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can expect to see the new F1 Skins arrive in Fortnite in-game on Thursday, November 20.</strong></p>



<p>The content arrives on this date as it coincides with the real-life 2025&nbsp;Las Vegas Grand Prix! All 10 F1 teams will feature in the drop, and you’ll be able to buy the content of your choice from the Fortnite store, as usual.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-f1-skins-amp-content-is-coming-to-fortnite">What F1 Skins &amp; Content Is Coming To Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>The ‘F1 Cosmetic Team Set’ is the headline addition as part of the exciting Fortnite and F1 crossover.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what F1 had to say on the collab:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[It] will include branded <strong>Outfits</strong>, <strong>Gliders</strong>, and <strong>Pickaxes </strong>that feature bespoke team branding from all 10&nbsp;Formula 1 teams. The Outfits and cosmetic items are inspired by the current F1 teams, and players can also get Formula 1 branded ‘<strong>Back Bling</strong>’, plus an ‘<strong>Emote</strong>’ to celebrate Victory Royales in style.</p>




</blockquote>



<p>You can only imagine the confusion of the F1 consultant writing up this statement, likely trying to work out what Back Bling is, but they summed it up nicely. It’s all the usual skins, Gliders, Pickaxes, and more, that we’ve become accustomed to with all collaborations.</p>



<p>It’s also unlikely that Epic will suddenly drop the V-Bucks requirements for these bundles. Expect to part with a hefty wad of Fortnite cash if you want to sport a smart Red Bull Outfit or drop into the game with a Mercedes-embroidered Glider.</p>



<p>Who is your F1 team of choice? Is there any gear that will be a must-buy for you when it drops?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is once again expecting big profits despite an expected slowdown in licensing revenue from blockbuster video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as 2024's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Games Workshop and Amazon finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3 is also in development.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/tradingupdate201125" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trading update</a>, the Nottingham, UK-based tabletop wargame company said it now expects revenues of at least £310 million for the six months to the end of November 2025, which would amount to a 15% rise from the same period last year. Pre-tax profit is expected to be about £135 million for the half year, up from £126.8 million last year. Shares in Games Workshop were up 12.8% on the news this morning.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s despite expected licensing revenue of at least £16 million, which would be down from the £30.1 million reported during the same period last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 may well be the most successful Warhammer 40,000 video game ever made. It sold over 7 million copies less than a year after going on sale, and, according to Saber Interactive exec Tim Willits, changed everything for the studio. Even Games Workshop itself has talked about the money it’s made from Space Marine 2, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-just-promoted-titus-from-space-marine-2-with-a-fancy-new-trailer-that-sets-up-the-next-narrative-expansion-for-warhammer-40000">protagonist Titus is now leading the charge on the next narrative expansion of the Warhammer 40,000 setting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop said it was on the hunt for the next blockbuster Warhammer video game</a>, but CEO Kevin Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between. “We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games,” Rountree said at the time. “Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Games Workshop had warned that Donald Trump’s tariff plans could damage its profits by up to £12 million, but it seems the impact has yet to significantly dull financial performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s primary business is of course the sale of tabletop wargames and their miniatures, with an expansive bricks and mortar retail business providing a foundation for the hobby. In July, Games Workshop said that a “cute looking pipistrelle bat” was “delaying our work on our new temporary car park.” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-the-warhammer-hobby-are-in-great-shape-but-the-company-has-two-problems-right-now-trumps-tariffs-and-a-cute-bat-that-is-delaying-work-on-a-new-car-park">Yes, really</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Uli Deck/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>One of the biggest unknowns about Valve's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">how much the cute little six-inch cube will cost</a>. Plenty of people have offered their thoughts about where the price may land, and now Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips has shared what he says Valve told him during a recent meeting.</p><p>On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAN Show</a>, Linus said he has no idea what the Steam Machine price will be, but in speaking to Valve, he came away thinking the system won't be priced similarly to a new console.</p><p>"When I said, 'I'm disappointed that it isn't going to follow a console pricing model where it's subsidized by the fact that the manufacturer is going to be taking 30% of every game sold on it over the lifespan of this thing, because I feel that would be a more meaningful product,' they kind of asked what I meant by, well, 'What do you mean by console price?' And I said, 'Well, $500,'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-steam-machine-price-to-follow-a-console-pricing-model-of-500" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN.</a></p><p>"Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn't great."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is far from confirmation of anything, and predictions about how much the Steam Machine may cost are all over the place. One expert believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">$400 is the sweet spot</a> for the entry model, while others believe it could be more than $1,000. Others believe it may be priced similarly to the PS5.</p><p>"Tariffs, surging memory / storage costs, supply chain volatility and an inability to subsidize to the same extent as traditional console manufacturers are all working against Valve at the moment," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1991311485323063443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said</a>. "That being said, the specs suggest Valve wanted this to be in line with PS5 pricing."</p><p>Before this, Linus said Valve told him they could not confirm a price for the Steam Machine due in part to "rapidly evolving market conditions."</p><p>"They did give me one hint, though. They said that while they expect it to be very competitively priced with a PC, that it will be priced like a PC. Rather than like a console with games subsidizing the upfront hardware price," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">he said.</a></p><p>Officially, Valve has only said its goal is for the Steam Machine to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">"affordable" and priced according to the value it offers</a>. This is pretty much what every company says about their products, so these comments don't tell us much of anything.</p><p>The Steam Machine launches in 2026, but preorders are not yet open and the exact launch timing has not been confirmed as of yet. For now, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">everything we know about the Steam Machine.</a></p>

<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160708/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>In the great pantheon of shoot-'em-up games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/tg16/r-type">R-Type</a> is both one of the greatest and one of the most excruciatingly difficult. Released in arcades in 1987 and drawing visual inspiration from the works of H.R. Giger, you pilot an R-9 fighter craft through spectacular alien worlds in a bid to destroy the Bydo Empire.</p>
<p>Although shoot 'em ups later evolved to favour more twitch-reflex gameplay, R-Type’s staple is its strict memorisation, requiring you to learn it by rote. As with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_gradius">Gradius</a>, not dying is an unspoken challenge: losing your power-ups makes recovery brutally tough, and the game's infamously aggressive checkpoints send you back a considerable distance each time you bite a bullet.</p>
<p>Impressed with the polygonal revision of Taito’s 1996 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/raystorm_x_raycrisis_hd_collection">Raystorm</a>, IREM endeavoured to make a similar transition for R-Type’s fourth entry. Being their first attempt at 3D, it was a project with a steep learning curve. And, while the result was glorious, it was also mystifyingly brief, remaining a PlayStation exclusive for 27 years.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160705/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> - a remaster that upscales the visuals handsomely. Its PlayStation-era polygons have been buffed to an astonishing shine without losing any of their characteristic charm, and overall visibility is greatly improved.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the game was originally in a 4:3 aspect ratio, some trickery has been done to create the illusion of widescreen, using an “expanded” fade effect on the border edges that, when locked in, you quickly forget are there. Its upscaling is on par with M2’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/g-darius_hd">G-Darius</a> port, and, coming from City Connection — a developer praised for their taste in re-releases but less so for their effort thereafter — its quality comes as a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta is one of the series' best, both smoother and cleaner than <strong>R-Type Final</strong>, and faster and freer than the three 2D entries that preceded it. Delta is to R-Type what G-Darius was to, well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a>: a remarkably slick, visually gorgeous game that maximises the possibilities of 3D architecture.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160703/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are now three craft available: the original R-9, playing in traditional fashion; the new R-X, with Force Ball homing properties; and the R-13, which is primarily hinged around its Force Ball’s sticky anchoring and laser tether. Impressively, each craft totally changes your approach, requiring its own roadmap to victory. Power-up modifiers vary greatly depending on the ship you’re using, making a maximum of nine shot-types when factoring in three per craft. Additionally, the doubling up of said power-ups expands the range even further.</p>
<p>Visually it’s beautiful and the audio is stellar. Set pieces abound as early as stage one: mecha-centipedes rip through burned-out industrial high-rises to encircle you in the foreground, and screen-dwarfing bosses pump out neon laser barrels and fiery exhaust flame. Dynamic and ploughed with invention, it cherry picks elements from its predecessors and paints them across a bolder seven-stage canvas.</p>
<p>Stage three is wonderfully creative, the entire episode just one hulking, stalking boss that requires travelling beneath its feet to strip its armoury, before climbing to its peak under a hail of missiles. The way the camera scales, shifting your flight path in various directions, heightens its cinematic nature. The fine visual and audio details are terrific, too, like the way the music switches to a muted, bassy throb the instant your ship dips below water.</p>

<p>Delta remains a hardcore memoriser, despite having more random elements than those before it. It also maintains checkpoints, although now getting powered back up post-death is much easier. Not dying, though, is still the star to shoot for, as maintaining a strong ship enables you to wipe out large enemies and bosses in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>More than anything else, though, Delta is about ball control. And by that, I mean the Force Ball: R-Type’s idiosyncratic ship attachment. More than any other game in the series, Force Ball usage feels so much more integral, and its strategy varies greatly depending on the different ship types.</p>
<p>Typically the ball can be bolted to the front or back of the craft with a touch. When positioned there, it provides different shot boosts depending on the colour of the power-up you collect. It also shields against almost all incoming bullets and missiles. With a touch of the button, it can be shot out directly into enemies or objects, and set to travel adjacently, firing as it goes to cover more screen space.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160700/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sending the Force Ball out on repeat is how Delta ticks, with the landscape and enemy patterns calling for ever-evolving strategies. When it’s fired into a large enemy it can be absolutely devastating, its point-blank hit-rate making short work of any foe - but its greatest trick is in its new “Dose” function. Now, whenever the ball absorbs a bullet on your behalf, it fills a gauge that, when reaching 100%, will allow you to deploy an explosive super attack against everything on the screen.</p>
<p>Delta has been engineered painstakingly around this, cleverly placing swarms of popcorn enemies in-between junctures so you can quickly ‘dose up’ with a little risk-reward flying. Attached to the front of your craft, it can be used as a collision barrier, nosing through enemy waves and building the meter fast. Dedicated players will be able to eke out myriad possibilities for maximising the Dose attack's regular deployment.</p>
<p>Delta proves incredibly deep and impressively malleable for a series known for its strict rail structure. Elements that pose problems initially can be quickly outwitted through experimentation, and often felled in the blink of an eye. Learning not just where to camp, but how to utilise the Force Ball effectively increases your offence and defence in equal stride. And when all else fails, you still have your charge beam to cut through incoming obstacles.</p>
<figure><a title="R-Type Delta: HD Boosted Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160704/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Although you start with limited continues, these increase through play time, and once a stage is beaten it becomes available in practice. There are three difficulty levels to choose from, and perks in the form of graphics texture options, screen dimension adjustments, and time-unlockable bonuses that will keep you plugging away.</p>
<p>Delta HD Boosted's only real presentation shortcoming is that, inexplicably, you can’t skip the lengthy start-up sequence on each new game. With no quick restart from the pause menu either, you’re forced back to the title screen to repeatedly endure the whole opening preamble. It’s an easily addressable oversight that proves genuinely frustrating.</p>
<p>Delta is often cited as one of the most difficult R-Type games, but I beg to differ. Compared to the more static nature of its predecessors, all the new tricks and possibilities here actually make it easier in many ways. Getting powered back up after a death is far friendlier, the Dose super weapon is a crucial get-out-of-jail-free card, and being able to adjust the ship’s speed can save you in a pinch. That said, it’s still hard as nails, and 'Kid' difficulty, despite the disparaging name, comes highly recommended as a first port of call.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A true arcade game that never was, and confined to the PlayStation until now, shoot-'em-up fans will adore what’s in store. A seminal work that has never looked better, Delta, with its boundless creativity and exacting design, stands out not just amongst its peers, but as perhaps the best R-Type the series ever produced.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s still crazy tough, and no quick restarts or scene-skipping is painful, but this new HD revamp is by far the best way to play it. If you’re itching for a shoot-'em-up experience of note, this will make your year.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Another week, another NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday with <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-Ultimate-is-everywhere/">a new batch of games added to NVIDIA's cloud gaming service</a>. This week, eight games are entering the service, while an additional title is added to the list of games playable with the RTX 5080-powered Blackwell servers. Also, those servers are just one region away from completing NVIDIA's campaign to make them available worldwide.</p>



<p>Regarding the games joining the service this week, the heavy-hitters are titles like the highly anticipated Persona-like indie game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-series-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-launches-next-month-on-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a>, the early access release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/prologue-go-wayback-open-beta-pubg-productions/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>, the new survival game from PUBG Productions that's finally releasing in early access. It's a different kind of class of heavy-hitters <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/">compared to last week's batch of games,</a> but they're heavy hitters nonetheless.</p>



<p>As far as the game that's now RTX 5080-ready, it's Ubisoft Massive's Star Wars Outlaws. A game that definitely didn't get off to a great start with players, but has since been updated for a much smoother experience that doesn't involve a bunch of frustrating insta-fail stealth missions. At least it was always a good looking game, and now that you can play it through NVIDIA's RTX 5080 Blackwell servers, it can look even better.</p>



<p>Speaking of those Blackwell servers, last week it was Phoenix getting added to the list of regions where RTX 5080 servers were available. The only remaining region on NVIDIA's list now is Stockholm, which isn't ready to go live this week, but will be ready soon. As a reminder, the Blackwell servers are only available to players subscribed to GeForce NOW at the Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>"<em>With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere</em>," head of partnerships and licensing at 2K, Sean Haran, added with regard to GeForce NOW in a press release. "<em>Anyone can experience the glory of Borderlands 4, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you're at home or on the move.</em>"</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining the GeForce NOW library this week:</p>



<ul>
<li>Spongebob Squarepants: Titans of the Tide</li>



<li>Long Drive North</li>



<li>Demonschool</li>



<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</li>



<li>Monsters Are Coming! Rock &amp; Road</li>



<li>Prologue: Go Wayback!</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>



<li>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li>



<li>Sacred 2 Remaster</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws (RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Open world Czech Bohemia-inspired orienteering game Prologue: Go Wayback! from PlayerUnknown Productions and PUBG creator Brendan Greene is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">out now in Steam Early Access</a> - and that's very inconvenient, because we <em>still</em> don't have consensus on a nickname. Back in 2017, RPS jocularly renamed PUBG "Plunkbat" - a show of feistiness that surely resulted in no angry emails (genuinely, I don't know if it did), and which I recently consecrated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bounty-of-gaming-news-discovered-in-isolated-scottish-cabin">writing it on the wall</a> of a random shed in Scotland. We are still massaging our temples about the new game, however. 
</p>
<p>Obviously we can't just call it Prologue: Go Wayback! That exclamation mark is some drive-by Yu-Gi-Oh bullshit, and besides, the title's arguably a tautology and I would like to be able to mention this game to my partner without sounding like I think she doesn't know what "prologue" means. So here's our working list of alternatives, mixing in a few other informal RPS titling conventions. Please pick favourites or suggest your own in the comments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Proback</li>
<li>Prologoback</li>
<li>Prayback</li>
<li>Progo</li>
<li>Ploway</li>
<li>Proooack</li>
<li>Puwack</li>
<li>ack!</li>
<li>Pooo!</li>
<li>Prolo!</li>
<li>Plab!</li>
<li>: !</li>
<li>Prologue Colon Go Wayback!</li>
<li>Pro Colon!</li>
<li>Colon!</li>
<li>Colon Go!</li>
<li>Colon Go Way!</li>
<li>GoW</li>
<li>Anti-Social Peak</li>
<li>A Good Walk Rewardingly Ruined</li>
<li>Gunshy Plunkbat</li>
<li>Revengeless Liam Neeson Simulator</li>
<li>Czech Stranding</li>
<li>Not Generated From Anything Stolen</li>
</ul>
<p>The last part is a reference to the game's map generation tools. As disclosed on Steam, the game makes use of proprietary machine learning software to create wilderness maps. Here's that disclosure in full. 
</p>
<blockquote>We are developing our own in-house machine-learning model which is trained on publicly available open-source data and vetted to prevent the use of any copyrighted material. This ML model is used to generate base terrain maps in Unreal Engine 5 which are then populated procedurally with custom assets such as the trees, rivers, rocks, and hills you explore. Our artists and designers use our ML model to allow us to generate 64km2 maps that look and feel natural and realistic. The game generates a new map offline on your system every time you play. 
</blockquote>
<p>It's one of the more informative such disclosures, responding to the broad concern about genAI using other people's art and media for their datasets without the creator's consent. It muddies the waters a bit, however: "machine learning" and "generative AI" aren't the same thing, as Embark recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">explained to us</a> in an interview about robot animations in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. 
</p><p>The disclosure also doesn't address worries about the emissions cost of 'training' generators by having them repeatedly go over datasets to extrapolate patterns - yes, it'll run offline on your PC, which suggests a lower energy footprint for the user, but it's not clear how much power was consumed during development. There's also the question of whether the map generation here contributes to overall normalisation of efforts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">to automate jobs and shrink team sizes</a>, even if the game's handling of such <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">technological terrors</a> strikes you as above reproach.
</p><p>
Such caveat! Much proviso! More context than I can easily get into here! And it's only going to get more complicated. As the developers recap on Steam, this is "the first of three games that lay the foundation for our studio's ultimate vision: Project Artemis", which is "a platform for massive, living multiplayer sandboxes where millions of players can shape their own worlds and emergent stories."
</p><p>Somewhere inside all of these metaversal convolutions and investor-facing language there is a promising wilderness walking sim. I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">interviewed Greene</a> and played the game earlier in the year (amongst other things, he told me there are in-game lore reasons for the title). I swam across a river in the dark and it did feel slightly magical.</p>
