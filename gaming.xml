			<p>While many didn't know what was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-new-project-state-of-play/">in store</a> for the State of Play, some had <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/">some guesses</a> as to what may be announced, with Lies of P's DLC being at the forefront. Unfortunately, Bloodborne remastered wasn't announced, despite many feeling it was confirmed with the DMCA takedowns of the 60fps mod and the Bloodborne Demake. However, we do have the next best thing, which is new Lies of P content. Showcased during today's State of Play, the Lies of P DLC was announced, with the title Overture. You can check out the trailer for Lies of P Overture down below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lies of P fans knew it was coming, as the DLC was announced shortly after the release of the game, which received positive reviews on all platforms. It's been nearly two years since the base game originally launched, and now we get to see Pinocchio come back, looking more fashionable than ever.</p>
<p>The DLC will take players back to the beginning of the Puppet Frenzy, the event that led to the destruction of Krat, which you experience in the base game. Players will then get to go on a journey through time to piece together the story of the past, present, and future of Lies of P, while being introduced to new locations and getting to experience new, thrilling boss fights.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting features of Lies of P was the wide variety of costumes and weapons you could experiment with, combining the typical "fashion souls" experience with combat that was suited to your playstyle. With Lies of P Overture, players will get to experiment with more new outfits, and more new weapons. The DLC will allow players to craft new weapons and experiment with a new combat style, as well as try out new Legion Arms.</p>
<p>The DLC doesn't have a set release date just yet, but it has been confirmed by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lies-of-p-overture-launches-summer-2025-on-ps5-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers</a> that the Lies of P prequel DLC will be making its way onto PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro this summer. Whether this means it's tied exclusively to those consoles for a certain amount of time or whether the DLC will be released on console and PC remains to be seen. However, considering there was no mention of PC or even Xbox at this point, it does provide a little bit of anxiety that Lies of P fans won't be able to experience it at the same time as PlayStation users.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Today, February 12, 2025, Sony held its first State of Play showcase of 2025. There weren’t any massive surprises, but there were a ton of really neat-looking games that just might snag your attention. In particular, there was a good chunk of third-person melee action, typically featuring swords slashing up some monstrosity. </p><p>Enough preamble, let’s get into everything we saw at today’s State of Play!</p></div></div><div><p>Sony kicked off their show with a nice little look at <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, in all its open-world, monster-bashing glory. If you haven’t been following this game, it’s worth checking out the trailer as it showcases a wide variety of beasts and environments. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>ships on February 28, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some slick-looking art and 2D platforming hack-n-slash action, <em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance </em>sees<em>&nbsp;</em>the folks behind <em>Streets of Rage 4 </em>take a shot at resurrecting Sega’s classic ninja series. Let’s hope it plays as good as it looks. I mean, some of those landscapes are just too gorgeous. I could die there and be okay with it.</p></div><div><p><em>Crossworlds</em>, as the name suggests, seems like it’s putting a world-hopping spin on the <em>Sonic Racing </em>series, with mid-race portals you can drive through to take you to other realms. It has a closed beta on February 21, which you can sign up for now.</p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah, it’s a <em>Digimon</em> game! When was the last time you played one of those? Time to stop playing <em>Palworld</em>!</p></div><div><p>With an ethereal presentation that promises a sword-swinging hero’s journey through some pretty spectacular-looking environments, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> looks promising for fans of speedy and flashy third-person melee action. Hopefully it will be stylish enough for the more discerning fans of the genre among us. <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> launches on March 30, 2025. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-recommend-id="image://e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-recommend-id="image://e84214561e6f53b9312b45ecde7fa4b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goro Majima looks at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A demo for the new <em>Yakuza</em> title arrives this week!</p></div><div><p>Here’s a mashup you probably didn’t expect. Ichiban Kasuga from <em>Like A Dragon</em> brings his cheerful disposition and thrilling heroics to the world of <em>Dave the Diver</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e466cb88e0d30f16532dd7f0baf69804" data-recommend-id="image://e466cb88e0d30f16532dd7f0baf69804" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A soldier opens fire on enemies at a distance in a science fiction setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A soldier opens fire on enemies at a distance in a science fiction setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->1047 Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e466cb88e0d30f16532dd7f0baf69804" data-recommend-id="image://e466cb88e0d30f16532dd7f0baf69804" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A soldier opens fire on enemies at a distance in a science fiction setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This <em>Portal</em>-meets-<em>Halo</em>-like sequel is rolling out an alpha demo later this month, on February 27. <br></p></div><div><p>Hey, if you always wanted to roam around a virtual hub dedicated to everything <em>WWE </em>(akin to the City in <em>NBA 2K25 </em>but for wrestling), check out the video above as Paul Heyman shows off The Island.</p></div><div><p>Oh, hi Randy. And other Randy. The Randys (Randies?) showed up to give us a quick look at the latest game in the cartoony-yet-always-gory <em>Borderlands</em> universe. I’ll have to wait till I get the game in my hands for sure, but from the looks of the trailer at least, the gunplay looks more solid and substantial than ever. The Randys also announced a special State of Play later this year that will go all in on <em>BL4</em>. </p><p><em>Bordelrands 4</em> launches on September 23, 2025. <br></p></div><div><p>Today’s SoP showed off even more of the upcoming <em>Split Fiction</em>, the science fiction meets fantasy fusion co-op adventure from the makers of <em>It Takes Two</em>. <br></p></div><div><p>I always sit up straight when a domineering masculine voice demands a status report. Maybe that’s something I need to work out with my therapist. Either way, <em>Directive 8020</em> is a flashy-looking science fiction horror romp that gives me some serious <em>Alien</em> vibes. Dead bodies on space stations, the creepiness of “substances” in space? Heck yeah. <em>Directive 8020</em> arrives on October 2nd.</p></div><div><p><em>Five Nights At Freddy</em>’s is getting yet another game, likely filled with even more animatronic creeps just waiting to scare the heck out of you.</p></div><div><p>With a lush, dark, and creepy aesthetic that’s giving some gentle Tim Burton vibes, <em>The Midnight Walk </em>is a fresh-looking first-person shooter with some clear stealth and puzzle elements. It arrives on May 8, 2025. It’ll also be playable on PS VR2!</p></div><div><p>I keep telling people that Octopodes are super smart. And <em>Darwin’s Paradox!</em> is all about that. This cute-looking platformer from Konami arrives later this year.</p><h2 id="h1070459"><a id=""></a><em>SLIDE #16<strong>Warrior’s Abyss</strong></em></h2><p>A roguelike <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> just might be the twist to this legendary series you never thought you needed. It’s available on PS5 and PS4 today if you’re interested in giving it a shot.</p></div><div><p>These days I continue to suspect that the PS2 era was peak gaming. It’s all been downhill since then. Is that true? I don’t really know. But what I do know is that an ambitious remaster of <em>Onimusha 2</em> is arriving on May 23 if you want to get a taste of that PS2 magic.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Onimusha 2</em> wasn’t enough, today’s SoP followed it up with more <em>Onimusha</em> (nuts, right?). This one isn’t a remaster, however. Rather, with a stylish modern presentation and some great-looking physics interactions, new series entry <em>Onimusha:</em> <em>Way of the Sword </em>is definitely worth putting on your radar with an expected release window of 2026. <br></p></div><div><p>Okay, for those of you who enjoy <em>MGS3</em>, I’m happy for you. The game is fine. This remake doesn’t inspire me to put up with it again, but hey, if you want to hear David Hayter play Snake again (who wouldn’t?) It’ll probably be worth it for that alone.</p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> arrives on August 28, 2025—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://d&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but you knew that already, didn’t you</a></span>? <br></p></div><div><p>Give me Adam Jensen—err, I mean his voice actor, Elias Toufexis—and a moody trailer for a pretty intense-looking sci-fi game and I’ve almost  forgotten what <em>Deus Ex</em> even is. With a release date of September 4, 2025, <em>Hell Is Us</em> looks like it could be a gripping adventure.</p><h2 id="h1070460"><a id=""></a><em>SLIDE #21<strong>Lies of P: Overture</strong></em></h2><p>If you were fan of 2023’s soulslike <em>Lies of P</em>, you’ll be happy to check out a trailer for its upcoming expansion, arriving this summer. </p></div><div><p>Where to begin with this one? Somehow, I imagine this is what Hideo Kojima’s dreams look like—glimpses of play with violent interuptions. Kojima isn’t involved in this game, but it still looks worth checking out as it seems quite imaginative. <br></p></div><div><p><em>Days Gone</em> might be mid at best for some folks, but I quite enjoyed it and with a permadeath mode and other features, I might be willing to give it a spin again. This remaster launches on April 25.</p></div><div><p>If you’re up for looking pretty and slashing weird monsters, <em>Stellar Blade</em> is getting a PC release <em>and</em> an expansion this June. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f37780dadd2b80700e0751465420222f" data-recommend-id="image://f37780dadd2b80700e0751465420222f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four teens walk across a fallen tree trunk in a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four teens walk across a fallen tree trunk in a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f37780dadd2b80700e0751465420222f" data-recommend-id="image://f37780dadd2b80700e0751465420222f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four teens walk across a fallen tree trunk in a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 1</em> sees the folks at Don’t Nod take on the story of a fateful summer in the lives of a group of young friends, and how they’re dealing with its ramifications as adults.</p></div><div><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a puzzle game billing itself as an “atmospheric architectural adventure” set inside a cryptic house that’s hopefully filled with  worthwhile secrets for those of us who like to snoop around where we probably don’t belong. <br></p></div><div><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em>, already a huge hit on Steam, is a co-op survival game that gives me some <em>Half-Life</em> vibes, with strange creatures and scientific endeavors that hopefully won’t doom us all.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f38ce624da495309169a18051da2acd3" data-recommend-id="image://f38ce624da495309169a18051da2acd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows title art for several Armored Core games and Patapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows title art for several Armored Core games and Patapon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / FromSoftware / Pyramid / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f38ce624da495309169a18051da2acd3" data-recommend-id="image://f38ce624da495309169a18051da2acd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows title art for several Armored Core games and Patapon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The original <em>Armored Core, Armored Core Project Phantasma, Armored Core Master of Arena, </em>and <em>Patapon 3</em> are coming to PlayStation Plus for subscribers with access to the Classics Catalog.</p></div><div><p>There sure were a lot of swords at today’s event. And while <em>Hell Is Us</em> maybe looks most appealing to me, I’d be lying if I said <em>Tides of Annihilation </em>wasn’t a close second.</p></div><div><p>Blood-pumping music and stylish action complete with wall-running and first-person shooting are at the heart of <em>Metal Eden</em>. It’s expected on May 6, 2025.</p></div><div><p><em>Mindseye</em> is an action adventure game about “AI and human greed” destroying society. It’s directed by Leslie Benzies, the former president of Rockstar North, so don’t be surprised if it gives off some serious <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>vibes.</p></div><div><p><em>Saros </em>is the latest game from Housemarque, makers of such elegant games as <em>Returnal </em>and <em>Resogun. </em>It stars Rahul Kohli and while the trailer has no gameplay, it hints pretty strongly at this game building on what the studio achieved in <em>Returnal</em>, which, it seems, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075">is exactly what they’re aiming to do</a></span>. <em>Saros</em> arrives in 2026. They closed the show with this one, so maybe it’s worth keeping on your radar? <br></p><hr><p>And that wraps up our rundown of Sony’s February 12, 2025 event! Nope, there was no <em>Bloodborne </em>or <em>God of War</em>. Sorry!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Tonight brought a closer look at gameplay for MindsEye, the mysterious new big-budget single-player project from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies and his Build A Rocket Boy studio.
</p>
<p>
Sony's State of Play broadcast contained a new cinematic trailer, too - confirming a summer 2025 launch window for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Hey, it looks like MindsEye will debut shortly before Benzies' former colleagues <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">launch GTA 6 this autumn</a>!
</p>
<p>
MindsEye was originally announced as part of Everywhere, an ambitious bid by Build a Rocket Boy to launch a fresh game platform akin to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Roblox. But this has seemingly been put on the back burner, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">in October 2024 it was announced that Hitman studio IO Interactive had picked up publishing duties for MindsEye</a> - seemingly as a standalone game.

<p>
"I've dedicated my entire career to crafting captivating interactive entertainment to delight players," Benzies said in a statement today. "With MindsEye, we've pushed cinematic adventure to the next level - building characters and a world that feels truly alive. We can't wait for players to step in and feel the immersive realism and tireless effort poured into every moment of the game."
</p>
<p>
Today's look at MindsEye gives our best glimpse yet at its story, which sees protagonist Jacob Diaz reliving disjointed flashbacks. MindsEye is set in a Redrock, a "fictional desert metropolis" in the near-future.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-producers-not-crypto-project-everywhere-is-part-episodic-blockbuster-part-roblox-rival">Eurogamer visited Build A Rocket Boy's flagship Edinburgh studio early in 2023</a>, when Everywhere was being seen as the studio's major focus. It'll be intriguing to see how much - if anything - of this earlier version of the project remains.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The MindsEye project began as part of the universe of Everywhere, a massive and experimental game developed by Build A Rocket Boy. However, due to its ambition, it became an independent title, focused on an engaging narrative experience with a lot of action elements. Check out the gameplay trailer below:</p>

<p>The game synopsis says the following:</p>



<p>“Introducing Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. Get ready for intense combat – on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air – where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.”</p>

            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have shared a release date for their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us will release later this year, on 4th September, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>

<p>Yep, that was Elias Toufexis chatting away during today's Hell is Us trailer, aka Adam Jensen from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series. Toufexis is voicing the game's protagonist, Rémi.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell Is Us," Toufexis said in a press release following news of his participation. "I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character, and the events that have shaped his personality.</p>
<p>"The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>If you also can't wait to play, you can pre-order yourself Hell is Us. Pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will open in the coming days for those interested in playing on either Xbox or PC.</p>
<p>Our Lottie had a little shot with Hell is Us last year. "The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Housemarque, the studio behind the sublime likes of Nex Machina and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, has unveiled Saros - a third-person action game that's coming to PS5 next year.
</p>
<p>
Details on Saros are slim right now, but we do know it's a single-player game set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet, haunted by an ominous eclipse." It stars The Fall of the House of Usher's Rahul Kohli in the lead role, with its gameplay said to build on the third-person action seen in Housemarque's critically acclaimed Returnal.
</p>
<p>
Saros' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK4W-hBrSZs">cinematic announcement trailer</a>, which incongruously opens with the sound of laughing children, sees Kohli waking on a beach beneath a shrouded alien sun, only to encounter a terrifying multi-limbed creature rising from beneath the pitch-black water. "Every time the sun dies," Kohli's character intones in voiceover, "madness reigns, then everything begins again. But after every death, I always come back stronger."
</p>
<figure>

<p>
That final sentence - reflected in the game's Come Back Stronger tagline - certainly implies Housemarque will be revisiting the roguelite structure seen in 2021's acclaimed Returnal (and the bullet hell swirl of Kohli's subsequently unloading weapon is a classic Housemarque touch), but whether Saros has anything more than a spiritual connection to Returnal remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Saros launches next year for PlayStation with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhancements also promised, and Housemarque says it'll be sharing a first look at gameplay later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-is-well-hrm-um-yeah.1107699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You'd think <em>Sid Meier's Civilization</em>--a game built on the same successful foundations for 34 years now--would be one of the most dependable video game series on Earth. The one game you could always count on to get it right, every time. And yet, here we are.</p><p>You've probably read a bunch of <em>Civilization VII</em> reviews by now. You've maybe been assaulted by Angry Thumbnail Guys on YouTube's front page over the last week. You may even have seen the news articles about the game’s Steam page being flooded with negative feedback. Whatever you've seen or heard, the word on the street is that a lot of people think this is a bad video game!</p><p>And I mean, it is. But it's also more complicated than that.</p><p><em>Civilization VII</em> isn't a bad video game in the way that,<a href="https://aftermath.site/millennia-4x-paradox-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> say, <em>Milennia </em>was</a>. There's a bedrock here making it impossible for <em>Civ</em> to ever suck in the truest sense of the word. It's a cliche, and as much a hallmark of the turn-based genre's psychological manipulations as anything to do with <em>Civ </em>itself, but it's also true: <em>Civilization VII </em>has, if nothing else, still got that "one more turn" thing going on. Despite everything I'm about to say, I have played this game almost non-stop for the past week, even when I haven't had to.</p><p>It is, however, "bad" in the sense that since 1991 a number of <em>Civilization </em>games vastly superior to this one have been released, which still look and play great. <em>Civ VII</em> gives us very little reason to give them up for the newest entry in the series, which could and should have improved things, but has instead regressed in many ways and outright confounds in others.</p><p><em>Civ VII</em> is "bad" because I was continually frustrated while playing it, was rarely kept motivated or interested for long sessions, and often ran into bizarre, uncharacteristic bugs and oversights. Despite playing it all week I've rarely found myself enjoying my time with it, and have indeed<a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> found more comfort this month in a 30 year-old spinoff</a> than in playing this brand new edition.</p><p>But I don't think it's a <em>bad video game</em>. I just think it's a rushed, disorganised mess, more a victim of weird management decisions and AAA release pressures than anything wrong with <em>Civ's</em> patented take on the 4X genre itself.</p><figure><figcaption>This is the American faction art, which is used when you select them then also...when you win a space race victory.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot wrong with <em>Civilization VII</em>. Some of it is clear in a vacuum; other issues are only visible--but perhaps more pressing as a result--if you're a long-time fan of the series. Whether you've been with <em>Civ </em>from the onset or just <em>Civ VI</em>, though, the end result is the same: almost every aspect of the experience has stagnated or gone backwards here, even from <em>Civilization VI</em>, which<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/civilization-vi-the-re-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I thought was itself a misfire</a>.</p><p>Let's start with diplomacy. <em>Civilization </em>is a series that has lived and, more recently, died with its diplomacy. Even as far back as the first game, a combination of character art, writing and personality has made your allies and enemies feel alive. I can't understate how important this was to placing your own civilization and efforts into context. For most of this series' history it felt like you were playing against <em>rivals</em>, not just the AI.</p><figure><figcaption>The new diplomacy system, where rivals speak to your character model instead of directly at the player, is a huge downgrade from previous Civs</figcaption></figure><p><em>Civilization VII</em> has reduced diplomacy to an endless series of transactional nuisances. A new diplomacy system has commoditised everything in the game, while at the same time removing the way Civs would often pop in just to say hi, exclaim at your progress or just threaten you, which makes the entire experience feel so much lonelier than previously. I never felt like I was one part of a wider human race in this game, more like one player tending to their little zen garden while everyone else tended theirs.</p><p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520793/civilization-7-firaxis-responds-mixed-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you've seen any of the negative feedback for this game, you've probably seen people blaming "bad UI"</a> for many of <em>Civ VII's</em> woes, and yes, the interface sucks, but "bad UI" has also become an unfortunate catch-all criticism for some problems that run deeper than some grey boxes. Civ VII's UI doesn't tell you things you need to know, continually tells you things you don't need to know, is slow and glitchy, is incapable of differentiating between what's a bother and what's important and is just generally a massive disappointment, functionally and visually, from its predecessors.</p><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> code</a>, of <em>Civ VII</em> once having an almost <em>entirely </em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of <em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Firaxis have said</a> they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><figure><figcaption>Lots of menus and screens that used to be adorned with custom art and thematic flourishes in older games are now just these drab grey slabs</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that is bad, but also not <em>bad</em>: the game's art. Not its characters or map, both of which are gorgeous, but the game's set-dressing, the illustrations that adorn its faction screens and key moments. These appear, to put it gently, rushed, to the point where some civs like the French feature near-complete illustrations depicting their national character, while others, like America, look like they were done on a lunchbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>The art manages to disappoint when it's not even there. In 1991's <em>Civilization</em>, for example, completing the scientific victory path earned you a lengthy cutscene depicting your people's journey through the stars. In 2025's <em>Civilization VII</em>, when I won the same victory with America, I got a two-line speech from actress Gwendoline Christie (who is admittedly excellent here overall) and an animated rendition of the same 18th-century artwork used at the faction select screen.</p><p>My main issue with <em>Civilization VII</em> is that, whether it was rushed or not, it doesn't know what it is. <em>Civilization V</em> had a clear direction. <em>Civ VI</em> did as well, even if I didn't end up liking it. <em>Civilization VII</em> feels like a game where it tries some stuff, cuts some other stuff then thinks about some other tweaks as well, but little of it feels like it's in the service of making the series <em>better</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>The way continents become megacities doesn't just look ridiculous, it robs each city and building of the ability to be scanned at a glance</figcaption></figure><p>It's as though <em>Civilization</em>, the Godfather of the genre,<a href="https://aftermath.site/humankind-re-review-amplitude-impressions-pc-sega-4x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> looked at <em>Humankind </em>copying <em>Civ</em></a><em> </em>and decided for some reason--<em>Humankind </em>wasn't great!--to copy <em>Humankind</em> in return. <em>Civilization VII</em> features <em>Humankind's </em>mid-game civ-switching, for example, which is <em>ruinous</em>, robbing the game of any sense of continuity or character. It has <em>Humankind's </em>meditative flow, where slow-moving units are queued up while they crawl across the map and city growth is tended to on a tile-by-tile basis, which is streamlining and relaxing to a point, <a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but also saps <em>Civilization </em>of much of its essential busywork</a>. It even has <em>Humankind's </em>town system, only here, for reasons listed above, it fails to properly explain it.</p><p>Ever since making the leap to a hexagonal map with <em>Civilization V</em>, and drawing in more and more board game influences in its wake, this is a series that has lost touch with its roots. With each successive game and expansion over the past 15 years <em>Civ </em>has been looking increasingly at stuff like numbers, optimisation and metas and lost sight of what made the series so special in the first place. The numbers in <em>Civ</em> were never the point, they just ran under the hood. The point was getting to see and play with the stuff they were in service of: that feeling of taking a tribe out of the literal darkness and into space, building cool stuff along the way and dealing with rivals who felt like rivals.</p><p>Now, with so much of the <em>Civ </em>experience devoted to the board game-like optimisation of numbers and combos, and with so much of its busywork streamlined--worker units, one of my favourite pastimes, are gone entirely from <em>Civ VII</em>--it barely even feels like <em>Civ </em>anymore. If you'd told me <em>Civ VII </em>was a spinoff of the series, or a competitor's attempt at cloning it, I would 100% have believed you.</p><figure><figcaption>This glimpse at an earlier interface not only shows hovering tooltips, something sorely missing from the February 2025 release, but also a different banner for settlements as well.<span></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a></figcaption></figure><p>It's been a huge bummer writing this much negative stuff about a new <em>Civilization </em>game, so in the interests of saying <em>something </em>nice, I'll say that perhaps the game's biggest swing for the fences--the new era system--has at least partly paid off. By splitting the game into three distinct ages (Ancient, Exploration and Modern), each with a different scope and objectives, <em>Civ VII </em>games feel expertly-paced during their opening few hours. The Age of Exploration in particular is fantastic, as it broadens the game world itself, increasing the size of the map and the number of leaders on the board, helping to bring a real sense of weight to this particular moment in history.</p><p>I can't help being this negative, though, because nearly everything else new or changed here is for the worse. Of course <em>Civ VII </em>has that "one more turn" pull here, a basic sense of perpetual motion brought on by the progression of tech and the expansion of borders, because that's a psychological plot every <em>Civ </em>game can bring to bear. But I can get the same thing from other <em>Civs </em>already, without any of <em>Civ VII's</em> multiple missteps bogging the experience down.</p><p>It's sobering, <a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in kinda the same way we've seen with <em>Call of Duty</em> in recent years</a>, that such a seeming home run can be botched in today's AAA release environment. This game had all the time in the world to come out, yet here it is, clearly rushed and busted and unfinished and getting the reception such a release deserves. During my repeated downtime with this game, I couldn't help but wonder, If a new <em>Civilization </em>game can stumble and trip out of the gates like this, what hope do so many other legacy series have in the same environment?</p><p>Indeed the only optimism I can salvage here is that, like I've said, while there are some strategic missteps, many of <em>Civ VII's</em> other issues don't necessarily make it a bad video game. It's just not finished. And if we went nine years between <em>Civs</em> last time around, Firaxis have plenty of time to at least try and tie a bow on this one.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo"><h3>You Should Be Watching Common Side Effects</h3></a><p>The difficult-to-Google Adult Swim show takes aim at the healthcare industry</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/beyond-citadel-indie-retro-shooter"><h3>Beyond Citadel Is Gory, Obscene, And Almost A Masterpiece</h3></a><p>Inspired by Lucasarts' Outlaws and Bungie's Marathon, Beyond Citadel is mechanically one of the best indie shooters I have played in years and absolutely not for everyone.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Housemarque has revealed Saros, their next new IP and an evolution of the time looping shooter action that was last seen in their PS5 debut <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>. Saros is in development for PS5 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, and it’s coming out in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This latest tale takes players to the planet carcosa, with an ominous eclipse and the end of the world sending poor Arjun Devraj (portrayed by Rahul Kohli) into a deadly time loop. He’s a Soltari Enforcer, looking for answers on a lost off-world colony.</p>
<p>Saros will feature a permanent progression system where death reshapes the world and gives you new upgrade possibilities to defeat the challenges you face. That’s a wordy way of saying it’s going to be a roguelike.</p>
<p>It’s also confirmed that it will be another third-person action game, again looking to evolve the gameplay from Returnal.</p>

<p>Gameplay will be revealed in due course, but we’re immediately rather excited for this one!</p>
<p>Looking back on Returnal,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/returnal-review-ps5/"> our glowing 9/10 review</a> of the PS5 launch window game said, “It feels immensely satisfying to be sat here in 2021, eons after playing Super Stardust HD on PS3, and see just how far Housemarque has come. Offering a visual bullet hell spectacle, a showcase for the DualSense controller and a rewarding sci-fi narrative woven around the roguelike loop, we can say with unflinching confidence that Returnal is the PS5’s best game to date.”</p>

		<p>Konami and developer ZDT have revealed Darwin’s Paradox, a side-scrolling platformer adventure with an abducted octopus as its star. The game has been confirmed for PS5, coming out in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin's Paradox! - Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbgsjUFIBOw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game looks like it draw influences from other platformer adventures of the last decade, such as Playdead’s Inside and Limbo, or Tarsier’s Little Nightmares, but gives it a more humorous, lighter tone thanks to much more colourful grahpics, a 1950s sci-fi style and animation in keeping with modern movies.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/darwins-paradox-makes-a-splash-onto-ps5/">PS Blog</a>, the team explain:</p>
<p>Our protagonist Darwin has all the evolutionary features of an octopus including the ability to climb almost any surface, camouflage himself, and also the skill to shoot ink to evade his enemies. Haptic feedback on the DualSense controller’s triggers will give you the satisfying feeling of firing off multiple shots of black ink to hit hard-to-reach levers and buttons, or to blind security camera feeds to plan your escape. When swimming in underwater scenarios, the ink shot disperses into the water, creating a perfect back smokescreen to help you get past searchlights without being spotted – just like octopi do in the real world when they feel threatened by a predator in the wild.</p>

<p>Keeping a close eye on your environment is key if you want to survive. As a typical octopus is known to do, Darwin can also morph his skin to match the spot he’s in – essentially creating camouflage to hide and avoid detection.</p>
<p>Darwin’s movements across the world are meticulously tracked with controller vibrations, giving you a sense of connection to our curious cephalopod everywhere he climbs. When you get hit, you feel it.&nbsp; In a world as dangerous as the one Darwin dares to explore, there will be short-circuit shocks, crushing machines of twisted metal, and roaming packs of rabid rats looking to make Darwin a tasty meal.</p>
<p>Certainly one to keep an eye on, if you ask me!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the most impressive games we saw at Gamescom 2024 was Tides of Annihilation. We haven't been able to talk about it until now, but the long embargo is finally over as the project was just revealed during the latest State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 and developed by Chengdu-based studio Eclipse Glow Games, this is a single player narrative-driven action/adventure game originally codenamed Ghosts of Fog. The setting features modern-day London mixed with many fantasy elements, some of which are explicitly borrowed from the Arthurian and Knights of the Round Table myths.</p>
<figure>

<p>The main character is Gwendolyn, seemingly the only human survivor roaming in a post-apocalyptic London, who embarks on a journey to reclaim her legacy and her homeland. Eventually, she gains the ability to summon two Knights of the Round Table to fight at her side. In the footage, the combat&nbsp;looked fast, frantic, and meaty. The developers promised that the skills would be customizable, too.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation clearly takes some cues from games like Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus, as there are some gigantic bosses that are practically like their own level. Gwendolyn can climb on and explore them. Level design as a whole is inspired by the Metroidvania genre, featuring interconnected levels and shortcuts to unlock between them. London itself is also meant to be a character of sorts in the game. The developers likened it to a tree, with each branch being an iconic landmark, albeit transformed.</p>
<p>The team had around 100 developers during Gamescom 2024, although it planned to increase the size to 130 by the end of 2024 as Tides of Annihilation approached its beta phase. The employees have several years of experience at triple-A studios like Sega, Ubisoft, and Gameloft. For example, the game's producer designed combat in Yakuza 0, while the lead programmer worked on technologies used in Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia games.</p>

<p>The team also clarified that, much like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Eclipse Glow Games has received an investment from Tencent but is not owned by Tencent. Moreover, they already have plans to expand the IP to other mythologies, such as Egyptian, Chinese, and Japanese, if it is as successful as they hope.</p>
<p>Tides of Annihilation is currently in development for PC and consoles, with no publicly announced release window. You can find more info in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Q&amp;A with the developers</a>.</p>

			<p>Housemarque Games, the studio behind some of the best shooter games released in the past few years, announced today their next project called Saros.</p>
<p>The new game, which was announced during today's State of Play with a cinematic trailer and will launch sometime next year, is being built on the features of the studio's latest game, Returnal, to offer the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque trademark gameplay where every death will reshape the world while offering new upgrades to the player. Judging from the game's description and what happens in the trailer, there's little doubt that the game will feature some roguelike mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Cinematic Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rK4W-hBrSZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque's gameplay-first experience.</em></p>
<p>Saros is currently in development for PlayStation 5, and will release sometime next year. You can learn more about Returnal, the game upon which Housemarque is building their next title, in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>

            <p>Chinese developers Eclipse Glow Games have revealed Tides Of Annihilation, a fantasy hack-and-slash set in a "twisted", modern yet Arthurian version of London. It casts you as Gwendolyn, a baby-faced blood-letter who must defeat <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>'s demi-gods by *checks notes* throwing the Knights of The Round Table at them.</p><p>I'm interested in the game partly because it's a Chinese interpretation of London, complete with a tipped-over Millennium Wheel and cheery red phone booths, and I'm always eager to see my own plague-ridden cultural inheritance reflected in the eyes of artists from overseas. I already have some pointers for Eclipse Glow. For instance, the River Thames looks <em>far</em> too clean, massive fish demons notwithstanding, and there aren't nearly enough sexshop fliers in those phone booths.</p>
<p>I also like the bits in the announcement trailer where bosses growl about "doomed fates", then do a martial breakdance at you with mild overtones of Cat.exe Has Stopped Working. Love a good flamboyant boss. There are over 30 of them in the game, including a beefy bloke with floaty dreadlocks and a lady who seems to have borrowed Gilgamesh's Gate Of Babylon ability from Fate/Stay Night. Gwendolyn, for her part, comes equipped with combos, juggles, invisi-dodges and the aforesaid ability to project spectral knights to smash things up or light them on fire.</p>

<p>The press release cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata as comparisons. They could have chucked Final Fantasy 16 in there, too - the knight-summoning mechanics remind me of the latter game's Eikons. Also, God Of War 3 or Shadow Of The Colossus, given that Tides Of Annihilation's London is full of wandering, armoured titans who serve as "dynamic, interconnected vertical challenges". </p>
<p>The developers - who are funded by Tencent, and include former Sega and Ubisoft people - say it'll take you at least 30 hours to finish. The thing I like least right now is Gwendolyn's acting. It's like somebody left Morphydd Clark's Galadriel in the fridge. I guess we can't all be Cate Blanchett. Anyway, you can read more about Tides Of Annihilation on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/_/">Steam</a> (page not live at the time of writing). There's no release date yet.</p>
