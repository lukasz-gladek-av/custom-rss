            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord made a rather intriguing announcement back in March during the 2025 Game Developers Conference. On March 17 it announced a "social infrastructure and communications" SDK for the platform that lets developers use Discord as the social foundation for online games. The software does not require developers to force players to sign up for a Discord account, allowing creators to interface with communities that don't regularly use the popular chat application.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement is likely inviting extra scrutiny from developers who are paying close attention to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-names-former-activision-blizzard-and-king-exec-as-its-new-ceo">the company's planned IPO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-discord-sued-for-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor">increasing number of lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> accusing the company of facilitating sexual abuse. But Discord's popularity with players of all stripes means developers can't ignore the potential of bringing players further into the fold. Will they go so far as to make it the main chat method for those games?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Co-founder and chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy thinks so. In an interview at GDC, he said the SDK came out of a "listening tour" with developers. The companies they spoke with described how they had plenty of resources on hand to make great games, but they lacked was experience building social systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're really great at the social components," he said. "We spent ten years building the technology and investing in it. [Now] how can we offer that to developers?"</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/with-an-ipo-on-the-way-let-s-dig-into-discord-s-revenue-strategy" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord's rumored IPO has us digging into its revenue strategy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That technology includes features such as "unified friends lists" that let players mix Discord and in-game friends lists, stronger game invitation mechanics, and "linked channels" that let players interact with Discord channels in-game instead of with the app. Communication through these channels will still be covered under the company's moderation tools and policies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord's strength as a social platform is undeniable—and a critical one in an evolving landscape of "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future">online social</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" play preferences in video games that go beyond classic multiplayer games.

(Looking off to my second monitor, a large advertisement for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII -VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> blocks some of my view of channels and servers.) Quests are, of course, a pricier advertising venue, and may not be right for all developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Quests are driving players to play more," Sellis did say, calling it a strong "baseline metric" developers who've engaged with Quests have observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The history of Discord's quests does interact with a major part of the "online social" trend: the growing habit of players livestreaming games to their friends. It's a crucial way that even single-player games have become part of this trend. Sellis said developers they've spoken with are "curious" about rewarding players for this kind of activity, which doesn't fit neatly into existing community strategies like server management or purchased advertising.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vishnevskiy pointed out that the first-ever quest Discord rolled out was a challenge to players to stream a game to their friends. That didn't necessarily make the act more popular—but one might see it as Discord recognizing its growing importance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sellis added that Discord has seen data indicating players who watch the games their friends stream are more likely to pick up a copy themselves—a modern day version of going over to your friend's house to watch them play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Devil May Cry 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then going home and buying your own copy (in my case, without your parents knowing).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're curious who's using the new Discord SDK, the company stated in its announcement that a range of companies from Tencent, to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Splitgate 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer 1047 Games, to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Supervive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Theorycraft Games, to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/free-to-play-publisher-scopely-is-now-owned-by-saudi-backed-savvy-games-group">Saudi-owned Scopely</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are all among the first to start building social systems on top of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Theorycraft Games CEO Joe Tung made the biggest pitch for the tech, saying the company's use of Discord goes so far as relying on it for its fully-remote office.

		<p>There has never been an Xbox VR headset so the reveal of the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition might have you thinking that has changed, but that is not the case. The pack includes three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate so you will be able to play Xbox games, but as there are no native VR games for Xbox you will only be able to play non-VR games on a very big virtual screen.</p>



<p>“For the first time, we’re thrilled to deliver a Quest headset that not only delivers incredible mixed reality experiences but is also crafted for Xbox fans,” comments The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is available today for $399.99 USD, and it comes loaded with everything you need to start gaming on a massive virtual display the moment you open the box.”</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom 128GB Meta Quest 3S in Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green</li>
<li>Matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller</li>
<li>Elite Strap</li>
<li>3 months of Meta Horizon+</li>
<li>3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</li>
</ul>
<p>“Using the Xbox app on Quest, players can instantly access hundreds of games directly with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta), including S<em>outh of Midnight</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Avowed</em>, and more as part of their Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.,” adds Game Pass Ultimate members can also stream select cloud-playable games they own, even if they are not included with Game Pass Ultimate. You can find the full list with over 100 supported titles in the Stream Your Own Game collection <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">here</a>.”</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will be available at&nbsp; <a href="https://www.meta.com/gb/">meta.com</a>, Best Buy (USA), Argos (UK), and EE (UK), but quantities are extremely limited. I have checked and despite Microsoft saying they are available now neither Argos or EE is listing the pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>THQ Nordic announced that its Digital Showcase will return on Friday, August 1st, broadcasting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/THQNordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> starting at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / 21:00 CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</p>
<p>The publisher confirmed that there will be a slew of updates on previously announced titles (including some release dates) and a few surprises for fans, including world premiere announcements. When it comes to the announced games, the following THQ Nordic titles are confirmed to be in the Digital Showcase: Gothic 1 Remake, Titan Quest II, Reanimal, The Eternal Life of Goldman, and Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Gothic 1 Remake has been in development at Alkimia Interactive since early 2020. The game will be expanded with around ten hours of extra content compared to the original, as the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told us</a> during Gamescom 2024. Last month, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an updated demo based on community feedback.</p>
<p>Grimlore's hack-and-slash action RPG Titan Quest II had its early access debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to Summer 2025. This is definitely one of the games that will receive a concrete date during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a> is the new horror game in development at Tarsier Studios, the makers of the first two Little Nightmares games. REANIMAL promises to be a darker tale where players step into the roles of a brother and sister who go through hell to rescue their missing friends. Exploring by boat and on land, they'll have to use their wits to survive, work together to escape the hellish island and the dark secret that haunts them.</p>
<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a platformer adventure game by Weappy Studio. Lastly, Bugbear's car destruction sequel, Wreckfest 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in March in early access, so there's a chance THQ Nordic will simply outline a new update. The game isn't expected to launch its 1.0 version until at least March 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendos-drag-x-drive-set-for-august-release-date.1226757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for its upcoming wheelchair basketball sports game&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, with the Switch 2-exclusive title set to launch later this summer.</p>

<p>Per the Nintendo Today news app,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>will bring its rather unique-looking gameplay loop to the Switch 2 on August 14th. Essentially, it looks like it'll be occupying the same space in the Switch 2's lineup as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-arms-trailers-shows-off-fighters-customization" rel="nofollow"><em>Arms&nbsp;</em>did for the original console</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, it's a game that sees players taking part in a sport that looks like a cross between wheelchair basketball and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>, and it uses the Joy-Con 2 controllers' new mouse functionality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=xit-MTbt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=M6vZbNiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>looks to be one of the Switch 2's more unique games, and it's coming in August.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will pit teams of three players against one another, and each player will need to use both Joy-Con 2 controllers in their mouse configuration in order to push the wheels of their wheelchair around the court.</p>

<p>When you're ready to make a shot, you'll have to use your Joy-Con to mimic the movement of tossing the ball in the hoop. Alternatively, you can wheel yourself off the ramp next to the hoop for a slam dunk.</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>'s similarity to wheelchair basketball, journalist Laura Kate Dale <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated back in April</a> that Nintendo staff were told to refer to the wheelchairs in the game as "vehicles". The reason for this decision is unclear.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of Switch 2 games being rolled out (no pun intended) during the console's initial launch window. Others include flagship racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, 3D platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, and a host of third-party ports as well.</p>




<p>Said ports apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">haven't been performing too well</a> in comparison to first-party Nintendo titles, although CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has apparently been a winner for the company, outselling the initial run for the Switch port of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>

<p><em>Drag x Drive</em>&nbsp;launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14th. Let's hope we get to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-livestream-reveals-arms-fighter" rel="nofollow">see one of its characters</a> in a new&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> installment&nbsp;sometime soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Meta announced an Xbox-branded Quest VR headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137334/xbox-vr-headset-microsoft-meta-quest-limited-edition">last year</a>, and it’s going on sale today for $399.99. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a custom colorway VR headset that comes bundled with an Xbox wireless controller, matching Touch Plus controllers, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>I’ve been using the Quest 3S Xbox Edition over the past week, and I was surprised to see that Meta has actually tweaked its Quest setup process to incorporate the carbon black and green styling of this headset and controllers into the UI. This Xbox Edition VR headset is even pre-paired with the Xbox controller and boots directly into the Xbox app.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Streaming Forza Horizon 5 in the Quest Xbox app.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Xbox app on the Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the same one found on other Meta VR headsets, and it lets you stream games from Xbox Cloud Gaming. You’ll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to do this, but Microsoft has thrown in a three-month code that works for new and existing Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>I played a variety of games on this headset, both in the immersive Xbox app experience with a 26-foot virtual display and in the pass-through view that turns an Xbox game into an augmented reality object that sits in the real-world environment around you.</p><p>I liked the ability to curve or flatten the virtual display, but I found the fully immersive display showed off some of the flaws of Xbox Cloud Gaming’s low bitrate and resolution. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> looked a little blocky at times, but I never experienced much noticeable lag while playing games.</p><p>The hardware itself is very much just a custom colorway, with a green band around the front of the VR headset and a little green Xbox logo on the side. The Xbox controller has that same black and green styling, which also extends to Meta’s own Touch Plus controllers. It all matches surprisingly well.</p><p>Naturally, Microsoft will market this as an “Xbox” in the same way that it calls laptops, TVs, and phones an Xbox if they’re capable of streaming games from Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft has never done an Xbox VR headset, and this is clearly as close as we’re getting to one.</p><p>I think this type of “Xbox” makes sense if you don’t want to lug a heavy console on vacation or have to worry about attaching a screen. It’s really all in a single package, but you’ll need to pay that monthly $19.99 subscription fee for Game Pass Ultimate. This really would be more appealing if Microsoft finally launched its long-rumored dedicated cloud gaming subscription or even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">free ad-supported version</a> that it has hinted at in the past.</p><p>Meta and Microsoft are launching the Quest 3S Xbox Edition in the US and UK today. It will be available on Meta’s online store and in Best Buy in the US, or Argos and EE in the UK. “Quantities are extremely limited,” warns Lori Wright, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships at Microsoft. “Once they’re gone, they’re gone.”</p><p><em>Photos by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing]]></content:encoded>

The Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only being sold in a $400 bundle with matching editions of Meta's Elite Strap and the official Xbox Wireless Controller as well as 3-month memberships for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Meta Horizon+.</p><p dir="ltr">That's actually a pretty good deal. The regular Meta Quest 3S 128GB retails for $299 and normally only includes the headset and Touch Plus controllers. The other four items in the bundle--Xbox Wireless Controller ($65), Elite Strap ($70), Game Pass Ultimate ($60), and Meta Horizon+ ($24)--are valued at $219, meaning you're "saving" $119 with this bundle. And that's without factoring in the special-edition designs of the controllers and headset. Xbox and Meta say supplies are limited, and once it sells out, it's gone for good.</p><div title="6532660 - Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3743" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532660 - Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click">$400 | Limited Availability</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Aside from the Xbox-themed skin and accessories, the model included in the bundle is identical to the standard white Quest 3S that launched last fall. That said, this is still a compelling bundle, even if you aren't currently in the Xbox ecosystem. The Quest 3S supports Xbox Cloud Gaming, which means you can stream hundreds of Xbox games while using the headset's lenses as a personal display. Xbox's streaming library is locked behind Game Pass Ultimate. The 3-month subscription included here is a prepaid voucher, not a trial, so anyone can redeem it, even active members.</p><p>With the subscription and official Xbox Wireless Controller, this bundle has everything needed to play many of Microsoft's biggest games--provided you have a stable Wi-Fi connection. An <em>actual </em>Xbox system isn't necessary, but console owners have the added benefit of streaming their full game libraries via remote play.</p><p>Along with the vast library of games offered by Xbox Cloud Gaming, new Quest 3S owners will be able to claim and keep two virtual reality games each month from the Meta Store with Meta Horizon+. So you'll get six free games throughout the trial. Similar to Game Pass, a rotating library of Quest games is also available to active subscribers.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519568" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519568"></a><figcaption>Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519569,1300-4519570" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3S is a standalone VR headset, meaning it's equipped with all the necessary hardware to play or cloud stream games without the need for an external gaming console, PC, or smartphone. That said, you can also easily connect the Quest 3S to your PC to play VR games that require more hardware power; you just need a compatible <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Cable-Charging-Charger-Headset-Accessories/dp/B0BRQMFDQ3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">high-speed data cable</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3S is the entry-level version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-512GB-Ultimate-Experiences-Included/dp/B0DDWH41HB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">flagship Quest 3</a> and launched as a replacement for the Quest 2. Like the Quest 3, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and 8GB RAM. The major difference between the two is their displays. The Quest 3S uses 1832 x 1920 Fresnel lenses, the same type found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the Quest 3 sports 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for sharper visuals and better clarity. Additionally, the Quest 3S omits the depth sensor and offers a slightly narrower field of view. However, the Quest 3S has a bit better battery life, getting about 2.5 hours on a full charge compared to the standard Quest 3's two hours. Both offer full-color passthrough viewing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the Meta Quest 3S is also available in a 256GB version. While the Xbox Edition is not available in this configuration, those who want a larger internal storage space can pick up the standard Meta Quest 3S 256GB with an Elite Strap for $460 at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3--which, again, is almost identical specs-wise to the Meta Quest 3S but has a noticeably better display--is also available in a 512GB model for $500. All of these models include the Touch Controllers and a 3-month Meta Horizon+ subscription.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Meta Quest Bundles</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FBn1LWB&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition 128GB Bundle</a> -- $400  <ul><li dir="ltr">Includes Elite Strap, Xbox Wireless Controller, 3-Month Game Pass Ultimate</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Elite-Strap/dp/B0FD2ZYZC9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 128GB + Elite Strap</a> -- $360 (<del>$370</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0F2GYMC8H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 128GB </a>-- $300</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Elite-Strap/dp/B0DHLLGPGR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 256GB + Elite Strap</a> -- $460 (<del>$470</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 256GB</a> -- $400</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDWH41HB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 512GB</a> -- $500 | Also at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FqzBdJb&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a></li></ul><hr><p>The collaboration with Meta comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X reveal.</a> Similar to the new Meta Quest 3S, the pair of handheld Windows PCs offer an Xbox spin on an existing product--though the handhelds feature a retooled design and different specs compared to current Asus ROG Ally handhelds.

            <p>Xbox has collaborated with Meta to launch the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, a limited edition VR headset.</p>
<p>The device continues an ongoing partnership between the two companies, following the addition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Xbox cloud gaming to Meta headsets in 2022</a>. This was followed by the release of Xbox Game Pass to Meta Quest 3 back in 2023, as Xbox expanded its cloud gaming offering.</p>
<p>The headset features an Xbox design of black and green, along with matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller. The package also includes three months of Meta Horizon+ and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's out now, and costs £379.99. It is available directly from Meta or exclusively at Argos and EE in the UK.</p>

<p>US purchasers will find the headset at Best Buy for $399.99. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Through the cloud, users will have access to Xbox Game Pass through the headset - though this won't be fully VR versions of games. Instead, there are four display options, including one cinema-sized screen. Cross-play and cross-progression mean players can continue playing across the VR headset or their Xbox console or PC.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-vr-not-a-focus-for-project-scarlett-because-xbox-fans-arent-asking-for-it">Phil Spencer stated VR wasn't a focus</a> for the company's then forthcoming Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>
<p>"I have some issues with VR," he said. "It's isolating and I think of games as a communal, kind of together experience. We're responding to what our customers are asking for and... nobody's asking for VR."</p>
<p>He added "nobody's selling millions and millions" of VR units, before stating: "I think we might get there [eventually]. But yeah, that's not where our focus is."</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft is dipping its toes into VR with this collaboration, without developing its own VR system.</p>
<p>It mirrors the company's recently announced handheld console, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox branded ROG Ally from ASUS</a>. As announced at the recent Xbox Games Showcase, the handheld will be released later this year.</p>
<p>It's also in contrast to Sony's PSVR2, which has not been well-supported since its release in 2023. Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">Beat Studios ended support for Beat Saber on both PS4 and PS5</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember last week when an advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> popped up on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now"? This was, alas, a mistake, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-advert-reportedly-spotted-in-london-sparking-hopes-of-imminent-release">Nintendo confirming to Eurogamer the advert was incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the error has been remedied, and a fresh look Metroid Prime 4: Beyond poster now sits in place, with a 2025 release window plopped next to the image of Samus. This was likely hidden underneath the original 'Out Now' proclamation.</p>

<p>The advert itself is for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> Edition of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so touts features such as support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support. On its release - whenever that may indeed be - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is also set for Nintendo's original Switch console.</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond back in June last year</a>.

<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>

		<p>King of Meat is all about throwing yourselves into the televised fantasy dungeon challenges that are all the rage in the world of Loregok. Hacking, slashing and bashing your way through dragons, skeletons, puzzles and anything else that stands in your way, it’s a race to the finish line of this quirky gameshow… but it can also be a finish line that you yourself have designed.</p>
<p><iframe title="KING OF MEAT: Announce Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQrDgfGV_n4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s because King of Meat is another game that wholeheartedly embraces user-generated content, putting a fully-fledged Dungeon Create Mode into the hands of the players, and letting those community creations shine through with curation.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the team at Glowmade have a bit about them when it comes to making UGC-led games. Based in Guildford, Glowmade was founded by former Lionhead and MediaMolecule developers, able to draw upon the rich creativity and talent that this part of the UK is so well known for to put another spin on these community-led concepts.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to the basics. King of Meat is a survival dungeon game show for up to four players to take on together, running through room after room, each of which poses some kind of problem for you to overcome. That could be a horde of enemies to battle through, it could be some environmental puzzles to trip switches and open up doors, or potentially even a co-op oriented puzzle that requires coordination or combined smarts… or just a brutal obstacle course of spinning blades, arrow launchers and more.</p>


<p>There’s a madcap tone to it with the clash of themes and art styles –&nbsp;it feels pitched perfectly for an 8-10 year old audience – but at its core, this needs to be a solid 3D action game. For the platforming, there’s a healthy jump, Yoshi-like flutter jump and dive combo to help you cross wider gaps or avoid dangers, while getting stuck into combat is a flurry of ranged shots – which are also handy for hitting triggers from a distance – melee combos, and some ostentatious special attacks on top of that, from shockwaves, to black holes, or giant hoofed feet stomping from the sky!</p>
<p>100 official dungeons have been created by Glowmade for the game’s upcoming launch… but there’s also already a bunch of community-made levels that have been constructed through private testing phases. Just as with LittleBigPlanet and Dreams, all of this has been created using the exact same tools and capabilities as are presented to players with the Dungeon Create Mode.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting set-up for this, giving you an overarching blueprint view to let you lay out a mix of small, medium and large rooms of different shapes, blocking out your stage before you dive into the details. Once you do shift to the 3D view, the level areas are broken down into a grid for vertical adjustments, making any platforming sections you create nice and predictable in a fashion not too dissimilar to Super Mario Maker.</p>

<p>And then come all of the enemies and traps, all of the switches, all of the logic, and all the behind-the-scenes gubbins that will invariably be the barrier between a pure player and a creator. There’s simplistic adjustments to link up a switch to a door, a trigger zone to an enemy spawn, and other fundamental elements, but these are the gateway to complexities that would make the eyes of creative mortals glaze over. Already, there’s examples that Glowmade can point to of the community creating a working Simons Says machine, a game of pinball, and plenty of other ambitious stages and concepts.</p>
<p>Naturally you can then lose just as much time again sprucing up each room with custom decorations and decals, giving a world you’ve made a specific tone. Regardless of if your creation is a short jaunt or a devious challenge, once you’ve completed it to prove it’s possible and uploaded,</p>
<p>King of Meat, as with any UGC-led game, is a fascinating project to see come together. So much of the game’s charm and longevity will hinge on community creations, and having tools that are just inviting enough that people learn the complexities. What’s immediately clear is that, while hopping across to a rather different genre, the spirit of LittleBigPlanet is still alive.</p>

<p>The news was confirmed via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app with an accompanying trailer (which we'll embed above as soon as it's available online).</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the game will be an eShop exclusive, so don't expect a physical release for this one.</p>
<p><em>Drag X Drive was originally announced during the big April Direct for the Switch 2 as a 3v3 multiplayer-focused experience in which players use the mouse controls in both Joy-Con to move 'vehicle'-bound characters and shoot hoops to score points.</em></p>
<p><em>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">hands-on with the game</a> shortly after its announcement and praised the mouse controls, saying "it seems like a great fit and is pretty darn responsive". There is, however, an undeniable concernt that the game may not provide long-term engagement thanks to its rather limited premise.</em> <em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156990/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>It’s going on <em>seven years</em> since the first chapter of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_1">Deltarune</a> became available and after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_2">Chapter 2</a> in 2021, we’re now finally past the halfway mark of the story with the simultaneous release of Chapters 3 and 4. To mark the occasion, Toby Fox has decided to give the game an ‘official' paid release, including all chapters to this point, plus the final upcoming chapters whenever they complete development, and it feels like it was the right choice to do so now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> is an incomplete, but ultimately satisfying experience that already feels like a worthy successor to the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Kris, a quiet teenager living in a small town populated mostly with monsters, and their adventures in a mysterious Dark World they discover in the hall closet at their school with their friend, Susie. The two are told that they are prophesied heroes who will restore balance between the Light and Dark Worlds, and they soon learn that their main means of doing so is through finding and sealing various Dark Fountains that act as a sort of source of power for the Dark World. Joined by Ralsei, a native of the Dark World, the heroes set out to battle the forces defending the Dark Fountains and ultimately fulfil their destiny as the prophecy lays out.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156969/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It may sound like a rather clichéd premise, but Deltarune excels in defying expectations and keeping the player guessing. This is the kind of narrative that you quickly realise isn’t actually as simple as it initially appears, but answers about what’s <em>really</em> going on are trickled out slowly while new mysteries are continually introduced left and right.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, a sardonic and satirical sense of humour permeates the writing, keeping the tone lighthearted and airy until another sudden heel-turn where things get real <em>fast</em>. And while the jury’s still out on how this is all going to resolve, the latest chapters start building some welcome momentum as this narrative hurtles towards a conclusion.</p>
<p>Gameplay could be most closely described as that of a JRPG, but Deltarune bucks genre trends with some remarkably interesting and fresh gameplay ideas. For example, the turn-based battles you find yourself often drawn into not only include rhythm-based elements (like you’d find in something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>) but also include creative bullet hell segments when your party is on the defensive. Here, you must manoeuvre a heart around a small box as enemy attacks come at it from all sides.</p>

<p>Then there’s the matter of how pacifism is still pitched as a legitimate response to enemy encounters—you can choose to spare your foes instead of killing them, and this can even have later implications for the story.</p>
<p>It may be borrowing a lot of its combat elements from Undertale, but Deltarune generally does a great job of giving you plenty of combat agency while keeping you on your toes in those bullet hell sections. This certainly isn’t the kind of RPG that you mostly do on autopilot, dealing with the same enemies in the same boring ways, and the dynamism in battles is what helps the experience stay interesting and innovative.</p>
<p>To keep things fresh, Chapter 3 also introduces some minigames that totally change up the gameplay. Here, you can do arcade-like activities like dishing out food to hungry customers, defending a statue from waves of attacking foes, or exploring a brief and weird version of a top-down Zelda game. Though Chapter 3 itself had some mild pacing issues, I really enjoyed the gameplay gimmicks that it explored and appreciated the variety that it injected into the overall loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156996/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, Deltarune employs a very basic, but charming art style that ultimately goes for a lot of sight gags that play into the comical nature of most of the writing. My particular favourite instance was Tenna, a game show host with a TV for a head introduced in Chapter 3. Not only do most of his sentences contain phrases written in WordArt and accompanied by goofy sounds, but the character himself is drawn and animated in a completely different style from the world around him that intentionally clashes with everything else. Deltarune doesn’t necessarily impress with its otherwise simple visuals, but there’s something about its rudimentary spritework that fits well with the script's often silly tone.</p>
<p>As for the soundtrack, Toby Fox proves himself yet again to be a master of creating atmosphere. Whether it be the eerie ambient sounds that play when exploring a desolate hallway in the dark world or the intense chiptune tracks that punctuate many of the battle sequences, this is an effective soundtrack that manages to be both deep and varied.</p>
<p>Though it now feels like Deltarune has finally begun to establish for itself a more distinct identity from its predecessor with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4, the biggest issue with it at the time of writing is simply that it clearly isn’t yet a finished game. It feels like the available content certainly justifies the sticker price now being charged, yet there’s a lingering feeling of dissatisfaction upon reaching the end of Chapter 4 and recognising that it’ll be who knows how long before the concluding chapter is finally completed.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157003/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I wouldn’t say this is reason enough to skip playing Deltarune now, but just keep in mind that it’ll probably be years before development finally reaches completion.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 port itself, one of the key headlining features is a special room that allows you to utilize the new Mouse Mode for some cute mini-games. Here, you save a couple “Maice” from a cat statue, eventually leading to a battle with a cat in which you use both Joy-Con to move the pointers around to do things like dodge attacks or play a version of Simon Says.</p>
<p>It’s not particularly innovative or game-changing, but this special room is a fun little distraction and it gives the Switch 2 version a bit of distinctive content to differentiate it from other versions.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154970/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Those of you who have played the earlier chapters on the original Switch will be pleased to note, too, that there’s a built-in save import feature for this full release of Deltarune. If your old save data is loaded on the same console as Deltarune when you first boot it up, this will be automatically detected and you’ll be given the option to carry over your save data for chapters three and four. Alternatively, you can simply start fresh and play any of the four available chapters in any order you want.</p>
<p>I appreciated that Toby Fox thought to include this feature, as it ensures the transition to new hardware and the ‘full’ release goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Deltarune is a game that can feel odd to recommend, as it’s both difficult to convey in words what makes this game feel special and… well, it still isn’t <em>done</em>. Its goofy and subversive narrative, innovative battle mechanics, and killer soundtrack all combine to make this one worth the purchase in its current state, even if it is unfinished and the visuals still feel a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>At any rate, I’d suggest you pick this one up; there’s no telling when the story will finally wrap up, but the release of the latest two chapters has done a lot to round out what once felt a little anaemic.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that starting this week, those signed up to its Insider program can get a sneak preview of the Xbox PC app's new aggregated library feature, which gathers games from different storefronts together under the Xbox banner.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/23/xbox-june-update-copilot-for-gaming-aggregated-gaming-library/#PCUpdates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the official Xbox website, the company says the aggregated library update will begin rolling out to Insider members this week. It'll also be available on the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, both of which were revealed during the Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">summer show earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p>The new aggregated library will allow players to "conveniently launch games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net and other leading PC storefronts from a single library", with additional support for more storefronts coming "over time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-pc-app-aggregated-library-default-view.jpg?itok=kxnxOzj- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-pc-app-aggregated-library-default-view.jpg?itok=3SU1yJZI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Xbox PC app will soon let you view games from other libraries besides Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Xbox doesn't specify which PC storefronts you'll be able to view through the app, it's no stretch to imagine that the list probably includes popular apps like Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, among others.</p>

<p>As well as the aggregated library, a new publisher channel will also be added to the Xbox PC app in the next few weeks. You can access it through the Game Pass tab, and it'll show you "iconic characters from various publishers" in order to highlight "the diversity of publishers and games in Game Pass".</p>

<p>Console players, meanwhile, are getting more customization options for the Most Recently Used tab; you'll be able to hide system apps, pin favorites, and reduce tile numbers to make the window look however you like.</p>

<p>It'll also soon be easier to see in-game benefits for free-to-play games like&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>&nbsp;if you're a Game Pass subscriber thanks to the More Benefits page.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-pc-app-most-recently-used-console.jpg?itok=WFJwN7KY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-pc-app-most-recently-used-console.jpg?itok=gVFP4baE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox console improvements are coming soon as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company recently revealed that its next generation of hardware <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">won't be tied to a single device or a single store</a>, so it's entirely possible that this multiple-storefront approach will extend to next-gen Xbox consoles as well.</p>

<p>We'll likely have to wait at least a couple of years to find out whether that's the case, though. In the meantime, the aggregated library will be rolled out this week as a preview for Xbox Insider members, so check it out if you're signed up.</p>

When college sports returned to video games last summer, no one could have predicted just how much of a sensation EA’s dormant franchise would be. It not only took home the crown as the best-selling game of the year in 2024, but it went on to become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-us-ps2-1851724385&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-game-us-ps2-1851724385">the best-selling sports game in U.S. history in just five months.</a></span> Before the revival of <em>College Football,</em> formerly <em>NCAA Football</em>, college sports had been absent from video games for a while, as licensing became too expensive for most publishers to continue releasing new editions each year, which often felt half-hearted compared to franchises made for professional sports leagues anyway. </p><p>But the sports video game landscape is very different these days. Instead of EA and 2K competing for relevance in all major American sports, the former has consolidated its grip on football games while the latter has dominated basketball. So, considering the overwhelming success of <em>College Football 25</em> and how it revitalized the football gaming scene for many fans, old and new, it begs the question: Should 2K follow suit and bring back <em>College Hoops</em>? </p><p>To us, the answer is an obvious yes. It’s been 18 years since fans last played a new entry in 2K’s short-lived college basketball series, which began in 2002 and ended in 2007 with <em>College Hoops 2K8</em>. Beyond the precedent EA just set by restoring school spirit on the gridiron, here are five more reasons why 2K, the king of basketball games, also needs to return to its former collegiate glory.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c8a3cc6f22e99ebc23ad207e84b6f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://c8a3cc6f22e99ebc23ad207e84b6f0a6" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kansas Jayhawks mascot in College Hoops 2K8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Kansas Jayhawks mascot in College Hoops 2K8" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8a3cc6f22e99ebc23ad207e84b6f0a6" data-recommend-id="image://c8a3cc6f22e99ebc23ad207e84b6f0a6" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Kansas Jayhawks mascot in College Hoops 2K8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The simplest reason to make a new <em>College Hoops</em> is that there’s a huge fan base just waiting to grab a new college basketball game. If the success and attention that <em>College Football 25</em> got aren’t enough, then all 2K has to do is consider its own incredibly large share of the sports game market. </p><p>Of the millions of people who play <em>NBA 2K </em>out of their love for The Association, many, if not all, are also rabid college basketball fans – and that part of their fandom simply isn’t being served right now. There’s a hole in their heart the size of their alma mater, as they dream of taking their school to the big dance or going on a Cinderella run during March Madness, upsetting that number one seed in the first round.</p><p>On the flip side, people who haven’t played <em>NBA 2K</em> in ages should also be a consideration, given how stale the franchise has become in some players’ eyes. A new <em>College Hoops</em> would help bring defectors back into 2K’s basketball ecosystem like <em>College Football 25</em> did for <em>Madden</em>. And with the added ability to bring amateur athletes’ likenesses to video games these days, a <em>College Hoops</em> game could resonate with fans now in ways that it never could before.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="22d5fd4b2b91ebc6150561c3a28868fa" data-recommend-id="image://22d5fd4b2b91ebc6150561c3a28868fa" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Legacy mode in College Hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Legacy mode in College Hoops 2k8" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->2K</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="22d5fd4b2b91ebc6150561c3a28868fa" data-recommend-id="image://22d5fd4b2b91ebc6150561c3a28868fa" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Legacy mode in College Hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s no secret that 2K needs to overhaul both the MyCareer and MyPlayer modes that <em>NBA 2K</em> offers, and a <em>College Hoops</em> game is the best way to do that. 2K has dominated basketball video games for years now. As a result, since it has no competitors, it struggles to innovate. This is clear to see in MyCareer and MyPlayer. (And, for what it’s worth, the same could be said of EA’s Superstar mode in <em>Madden</em>.)</p><p>Career modes often struggle in the modern era of sports games because the money is made in online modes. <em>College Hoops 2K8</em> is beloved by many for its offline Legacy mode, in which gamers play as coaches as they take over programs, recruit stars, and build dynastic teams. But what about a mode where you get to <em>be</em> the star recruit? In an age where variety is at an all-time low in sports games, having a college version of <em>NBA 2K</em>’s MyCareer, focused on a created athlete, would revitalize that side of basketball games for many who tend to skip buying new releases each year because not enough new features have been added. (Again, an EA parallel here is how refreshing <em>College Football’</em>s Road to Glory mode is compared to <em>Madden</em>’s Superstar mode.)</p><p>MyPlayer, 2K’s sort of mode within a mode, a hub in MyCareer where you customize your avatar outside of the mode’s narrative, is what would need to most revamping if it were repurposed for <em>College Hoops</em>. For so many 2K fans, it’s hard to even describe what you really get out of this thing anymore. OG fans can’t stand how much junk 2K has put in between you and just playing the game. And for younger fans, whether they like the experience of MyPlayer or not, the sheer cost of investing in their players is staggering. </p><p>No such hub exists in <em>College Football</em>. If 2K is as smart as EA, <em>College Hoops</em> would take a similar approach to storytelling and character-building as <em>College Football</em>, creating a streamlined mode like Road to Glory that improves upon something like Superstar by offering more fun, fewer transactions, and lots of free customizations. If such a mode were added alongside Legacy, players could immerse their avatars in an on-campus journey rather than just styling their characters off the court in <em>NBA 2K</em>.</p><p>How would you navigate NIL deals and playing for different coaches in college? What would you do if you got passed up by your dream school after they recruited you? Would you stay in school if you lost in the Final 4? There are so many fresh plot lines out there for a new <em>College Hoops</em> game. Running around a college campus sounds far more fun and immersive than some invented city at this point. And being able to continue that journey in <em>NBA 2K,</em> the way created <em>College Football</em> athletes can be ported over to <em>Madden</em>, would make the whole process that much more fulfilling. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="565401e1c0a0a18a5aef5724bb88f4b0" data-recommend-id="image://565401e1c0a0a18a5aef5724bb88f4b0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A gampelay screen shot of Oregon vs. Georgia in College Hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A gampelay screen shot of Oregon vs. Georgia in College Hoops 2k8" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->2K<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="565401e1c0a0a18a5aef5724bb88f4b0" data-recommend-id="image://565401e1c0a0a18a5aef5724bb88f4b0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A gampelay screen shot of Oregon vs. Georgia in College Hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While <em>Madden 25</em> sales may have suffered due to the overwhelming popularity of <em>College Football 25</em>, EA only profited. Yes, in a monetary sense, but also, crucially, in a gameplay feedback sense. Many preferred the way playing the AI felt in <em>College Football</em> over <em>Madden</em>, which is critical feedback that EA could only get from publishing its own competition. 2K is not short on feedback from fans, but without a competitor, there’s little to no incentive to take risks or truly innovate year after year. But, the publisher making its own college game, ensuring whatever sales it loses from <em>NBA 2K</em> go to <em>College Hoops</em>, is the closest thing to a perfect feedback loop an insatiable shareholder could ask for.</p><p>Give us new shooting mechanics. Heck, go back to “old 2K” shooting, and just call it “new” for <em>College Hoops</em>. Tinker with animations, add a new gameplay mode – actually try to test something that fans have been clamoring for, evaluate it, then bring it to all other games in the future. Bring back the Chant Creator and give fans a fresh way to interact with their favorite teams. Much like the relationship between college and the pros in real life, 2K can benefit from having a built-in feeder system for its flagship basketball franchise.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3750406e2e5851f09cf0596fda88a416" data-recommend-id="image://3750406e2e5851f09cf0596fda88a416" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The front and back cover of college hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The front and back cover of college hoops 2k8" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->2K/TheCoverProject</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3750406e2e5851f09cf0596fda88a416" data-recommend-id="image://3750406e2e5851f09cf0596fda88a416" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The front and back cover of college hoops 2k8" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>College basketball fans may ask, “Why not have EA make the next college basketball game?” Well, while we’d love to see EA compete in the basketball space again (genuinely this time, not like what they did with <em>NBA Live 19</em>), if you want a college basketball game anytime soon, it’s got to be 2K who makes it. Plus, 2K already has a better college basketball reputation than EA. <em>College Hoops 2K8</em> is <em>way</em> more revered than EA’s <em>NCAA Basketball 10.</em> 2K can take the existing infrastructure they have with <em>NBA 2K</em> and go back into the archives with the <em>College Hoops</em> franchise and make something truly special. EA would face an extremely uphill battle trying to develop a new basketball game for the first time this decade, especially<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330?_gl=1*o2xlz7*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MTg3NzQkbzY3MSRnMSR0MTc1MDcyMjAxMSRqNTYkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330?_gl=1*o2xlz7*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MTg3NzQkbzY3MSRnMSR0MTc1MDcyMjAxMSRqNTYkbDAkaDA."> given the company’s broader struggles</a></span> outside of its sports vertical.

The women’s tournament has been thriving with dynamic players and teams facing off for the past few years, while the men’s game has floundered, with programs struggling to adapt to the NIL era in college sports. </p><p>2K has been integrating the WNBA more into <em>NBA 2K</em>, but the publisher has the opportunity to not only revitalize the<em> College Hoops</em> franchise by making it more inclusive but also to center female basketball players the way no video game ever has. Imagine USC’s JuJu Watkins as the sole cover athlete of <em>College Hoops 2K26. </em>That would go insanely hard.</p><p>“Go woke go broke” is ridiculous in any context, but as far as the audience for basketball video games is concerned, which is naturally as progressive as the audience for basketball IRL, this is a rare moment in which the monetary and cultural motivations for diversifying a game would perfectly overlap. 2K can prove it’s a supporter of female athletes by starting the next generation of <em>College Hoops</em> with the most inclusive rendering of college basketball ever seen in a video game, welcoming players who’ve never been fully represented in gaming culture.</p><p>Have NCAA men’s and women’s basketball in the new <em>College Hoops </em>on day one, plus Legacy and created player modes for both, and true ball-knowers will swarm to the game like Angel Reese on a “mebound.”</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/2k-college-hoops-ea-college-football-26-1851784967]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/street-fighter"> Street Fighter movie</a> may have found its Chun-Li, who will reportedly be a "lead female role" in the 2026 adaptation.</p>
<p>Callina Liang, known for her roles in recent thriller Presence and high school drama Bad Genius, has been picked for the role of one of gaming's biggest female fighters <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/street-fighter-movie-casts-callina-liang-chun-li-1236439931/">according to Deadline</a>.</p>

<p>Additional details on the Street Fighter movie are scarce. We know Capcom is "deeply involved" with the adaptation thanks to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but the premise or other featured characters remains a mystery.</p>
<p>What we do know is Chun-Li has found herself in a second surge of popularity - not thanks to the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> where a crossover skin introduced her to a new generation of fans. This skin has also recently made a return to the battle royale, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lj01px/chunli_is_1st_best_seller_for_3_days_straight_so/">quickly becoming the top selling cosmetic in-game</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review.1226637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Atomfall was a thoroughly intriguing, if flawed, game. Set in the Great British countryside after the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history, its rendition of Cumbria featured four beautiful areas to explore, sleuth through, and shoot things in. Now it’s time to wander down the jetty, hop on a boat and visit the ominously named Wicked Isle DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wicked Isle runs in parallel to the main game, which is to say, it’s another region you can access alongside the others. This being the case, it intriguingly features a new story that is both self-contained, but also connects back to the main story and provides new endings to reach. All you have to do is go to the dock in Wyndham and chat with a grizzled, old sea captain. He’ll give you a quick boat ride to a place called Midsummer Isle if you agree to find something for him – some literally blessed mead, as it turns out.</p>


<p>This is an interesting enough pitch for those wanting a bit more Atomfall, but once things get going, you’ll quickly realise that this is largely more of the same as the main game, except now there are some monks involved. I don’t just mean that this feels similar, I mean that the specific story for this island is close to a complete retread of the plot.&nbsp;Once you realise this, you notice how little information you’re actually finding most of the time, just letters from people about the mysterious voice, being one with the soil – you know, the usual.</p>


<p>The most helpful information you gain comes from memories of conversations from many years ago, as shadows or ghosts of monks have conversations. These lack impact for a few reasons, not least of which being that you’re just stood there awkwardly watching them unfold, and it’s far from a unique method of delivering information in video games. If this DLC had been part of the original game, it would fit right in and perhaps be a highlight, but for anyone who’s completed a playthrough, an expansion needs to bring something fresh or new, and this one doesn’t. Even the new endings are extremely similar, with just a few details changed, to the ones in the main game.</p>
<p>This feeling persists into the gameplay as well. I experienced some AI oddities in my run through the main game, but in Wicked Isle they were all over the place. Enemies were getting stuck when trying to climb over something because they keep inexplicably jerking back away from the ledge, enemies were just not moving or shooting at all, clipping through cover, or just generally being poor. Maybe I got lucky on the main game playthrough, or unlucky here, but it’s felt particularly bad.</p>
<p>There’s the same mix of enemy types to encounter – bandits and the infected – but there are two new foes to face. One is a boss fight that was quite novel and fun, the other is an aquatic feral, which would be a nice surprise if the first thing I thought when I saw one wasn’t “that is a drowner from the Witcher 3, isn’t it?” because they look, move, attack, and sound exactly like them, but are even more annoying to fight because <em>you can’t dodge or block!</em></p>

<p>Returning to Atomfall also means returning to its gameplay systems. Honestly, I don’t know how I played through the game on the recommended difficulty. I was miserable when I first returned to play this DLC, constantly running out of ammunition, still wishing for a dodge or block in melee combat, the severely limited inventory, and infected enemies that can literally soak up six full shots to the head from a sniper rifle. I ended up tuning the difficulty by making ammo more common and enemies far less tough and it was a huge improvement. Sure I could still run out of ammo sometimes, but now at least I have a chance of meleeing everyone, even without being able to block, which is still one of the most mystifying decisions I’ve seen in a combat system. Walking around awkwardly in front of people to try and dodge their attacks is the least immersive form of combat I’ve ever encountered. It feels like a Monty Python skit.</p>
<p>Once I’d fixed the difficulty a bit, I was having fun. There are some highlights here mostly in the new characters, who are as delightfully odd as you’d expect, but then it decided to give me fetch quests back to the mainland. A side quest wanted me to traipse about the Interchange finding messages to discover what happened to someone, muttering swear words under my breath the entire time (that wasn’t a quest requirement, it happened naturally). Yes, your first guess about what happened to that person is correct, but the game wants you to wander around and to collect messages from areas that not only have enemies in them, but sometimes those enemies respawn or are replaced with other enemies when you slightly leave the area to look around a corner.</p>

<p>I wasn’t going to bother doing this side quest, but then the main story of the DLC also sent me to three different regions on the mainland, this time to spend five seconds in each digging something up, so I thought I may as well do both missions and waste as much of my time as possible. They were both very unsatisfying and just felt like obvious padding to extend the length of the DLC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bloober Team (recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be working on a remake of the first Silent Hill) has published a new developer diary to show off the combat mechanics of its next game, Cronos: The New Dawn.</p>
<p>The developers said they are putting a lot of emphasis on a tactical combat experience. Players will have to remain cautious and alert at all times because the game's enemies, the Orphans, can merge with each other. When players kill an enemy, the defeated foe can become fuel for other enemies to be absorbed and become stronger. Each encounter in the game is handcrafted, and in some cases, you can use the environment to your own advantage, such as firing at a canister or luring the enemy out into your position, or you can just go into melee and fight them head-on. Even within Bloober Team, some developers play more offensively, while others prefer a more defensive approach. It depends on the loadout, the gameplay style, and how many resources you have.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn features different types of weapons, tools, and abilities, so players will have to figure out by themselves what works best for their playstyle. Resource management is also a key in the game. More offensive players may want to craft more ammunition, while defensive players should have more health packs. Like in other survival horror games, there's also a progression tree where players can upgrade the weaponry, the tools, and the suit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive into The Combat" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWVTXo05K7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bloober has also revealed to have devised specific roles for the enemies. There's runners who just run to the player and try to kill him as fast as they can. There are ranged foes who stand behind and shoot, forcing the player to get closer. There are bruisers, 'big ass tanky guys' whose only goal is to grab as much resources they can from you. The team believes these differences will create a lot of unique encounters where players must think, analyze, and decide what would be the best<br>
primary target in each instance.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have a fixed release date yet, but it does have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release window</a>: Fall 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-voxel-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-as-dev-shuts-down.1226628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>developer Hypixel Studios has announced that the ambitious voxel sandbox game has been canceled, and that the studio itself will be shutting down as well.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>website, Hypixel co-founder Noxy says that the decision to shut the game down came "after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path".</p>

<p>Noxy says that despite a major engine reboot,&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>needed "a lot more time" in order for the developers to "get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision" they had for the game. According to Noxy, Hypixel's "vision evolved" and its "technical ambitions grew more complex" over time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=n6GAShfQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-canceled-dev-shutting-down-monsters.jpg?itok=hxGeTByO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is shutting down, and its developer is no more, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>team looked at "reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward", according to Noxy, but each option "would have meant compromising on what made&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>special in the first place" and would have meant the game was not "the game [fans] deserve".</p>

<p>As for Riot Games, which acquired&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>and Hypixel (the studio, rather than the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server; more on that in a moment) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, Noxy says the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>studio is supporting Hypixel during the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>.</p>

<p>According to Noxy, Riot is "ensuring [the] team is supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what's next", a move Noxy describes as "not just thoughtful", but also "human".</p>

<p>When it comes to the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>Hypixel server, Noxy assures fans that said server won't be affected by&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>'s cancellation; that server is run separately from the studio, even though they share a name, so it'll "continue to operate as usual".</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>was, its creators describe it as a game that "combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game".</p>

<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>would have taken place in a procedurally-generated world in which players could construct buildings and other structures, embark on adventures, and even use script to create minigames and much more. Sadly, of course, none of that will be possible within the game now.</p>

<p>The shutdown of Hypixel and the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>comes among a wider wave of studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">closing down</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">reducing their headcount</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling projects</a>, with companies both big and small among the affected.</p>

In 2022, he created the award-winning YouTube channel “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</u></a>,” in which he shared insight and advice on all aspects of making a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai’s approach differs from that of many game creators who have gone on to form their own companies. “When a game creator becomes the president of a company, it is difficult for them to fully engage in creative activities,” explained Sakurai. “There was a conflict between making interesting games and making management decisions — the problem was that being overwhelmed by the duties of being a president made it hard to focus on the vital part, game creation.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This led Sakurai to his current approach, which involves creating games without directly hiring or managing any employees. “Basically I work together with other game companies to avoid having to manage a company,” Sakurai explained. “This method has worked well so far. I am able to continue being creative and concentrate on making things without becoming extremely busy running a company.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Sakurai noted that his method is not without its challenges. Working with different game devs means that Sakurai has to “build up trusting relationships and working styles from scratch every time. So, I think it is necessary to have a certain degree of flexibility.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Sakurai, one of the most important elements when working with a team on a new project for the first time is to make sure everyone is on the same page and has a clear, shared vision of the game. “I make sure that many members of staff can share the same information at the same time, regardless of their job or whether they are designer or programmer.” Although this takes more time and planning, Sakurai said that in his experience, this approach “reduces the risk of information gaps” and misunderstandings. “Conversely, if I just conveyed my ideas to the producer, and then they assign work to various other people, then some kind of misunderstanding would occur, or even a 180 degree difference (in what was intended).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, when asked whether his approach would be the best for the game industry as a whole, Sakurai was hesitant. “It depends on the person. As for me, I had built up a track record and trust through working on Kirby and Smash Bros. titles in the past. If you don’t have this, if you don’t have any track record at all, then the work won’t come to you. This is a way of working that becomes possible through gaining more allies by continuing to make good games, and it is not a style of working that works well for everyone.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/gettyimages-1346038907-1750764035196.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Masahiro Sakurai has a long history of working with Nintendo. Photo by Bob Riha, Jr./Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai went on to highlight another issue in the current game industry that could make it difficult for individuals to break through as auteurs in the same way as they did in the past. “I feel like the position of game director itself is becoming rarer these days. As in, it is rather rare to find someone who, as a director, can take charge of a studio with hundreds of people,” Sakurai stated. “There are plenty of people who want to make games or who are making games, but there is a shortage of game directors who can manage projects with a large number of staff.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Sakurai’s opinion, the increased segmentation of game development into specialized roles is the reason for this lack of game directors with the “all-rounder” background necessary to oversee large-scale projects. “In the past, there was a trend by which people would go from being a graphics artist to a planner, and then become a director.” Sakurai explained. “However today, graphics alone, for example, are divided into models, effects, textures and so on. I feel it is very difficult to develop into an all-rounder in such an environment. I feel like this increasing specialization and segmentation has resulted in a lack of directors who can see things from a broad perspective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai advised that it is important for people to understand their own individuality, and develop that accordingly. “I don’t think anyone will follow the same path that I did, but I’m sure that there will be people who break through in other directions,” said Sakurai. In other words, rather than trying to match or compete with the work and achievements of creators who have come before you, it is important to hone your own strengths and focus on what you can bring to the table. “I believe each creator should carve out their own path.” Sakurai insisted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Top 25 Switch Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai concluded that both AAA projects and indie games are facing difficult situations. “I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work.” he said, before suggesting generative AI as a potential tool for helping to solve this problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“(...) the only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai noted that indie titles have their own challenges, one being the sheer amount of competition. “Indie games are appealing for their freedom and creativity, but they also need a lot of luck, effort, polish and stand-out elements to succeed in the market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sakurai is currently working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a>, the Minecraft competitor announced in 2018, is canceled and its developer is shutting down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hypixel Studios announced that the ambitious, Riot Games-backed Minecraft-style game had ended development, and the studio itself was in the process of winding down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that has an incredible 61 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>. Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot Games, maker of League of Legends, invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the Hytale dream is now over. “This is not the outcome any of us — at Hypixel or at Riot — wanted,” a statement attributed to co-founder Noxy <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published to the Hytale website</a> reads. “But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what went wrong? According to Noxy, Hytale’s technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a reboot of the game engine, the team “found that Hytale still wasn’t as far along as it needed to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game,” Noxy continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Options such as reducing scope and pushing the game back were rejected as they “would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place.” “It wouldn’t have been the game we set out to make,” Noxy explained. “And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Riot, it tried to find investors to save the project, but it sounds like those efforts failed to go anywhere. The affected staff are getting “generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation of the cancelation comes just a few months after <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/3/spring-2025-development-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypixel issued a spring 2025 development update</a>, where the studio revealed some of the progress it had made in the first few months of the year. It even finally revealed a new character that it had teased at the end of 2023. New engine progress was called out, with improvements highlighted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>The timings for the event are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6pm (Thu) PDT / 7pm (Thu) MDT / 8pm (Thu) CDT / 9pm (Thu) EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2am BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3am CEST / 4am EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 10am JST / 9am AWST / 11am AEST</li></ul><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxnwiy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The official video description reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARC SYSTEM WORKS Showcase will be broadcast, delivering the latest information on Arc System Works, including the announcement of new titles!</p>
<p>"In addition to the latest information on various game titles, including completely new titles developed and published by Arc System Works, we will also be announcing a new project that Ishiwatari Taisuke is working on."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can probably expect to see a bit more from the studio's upcoming project with Sony Interactive Entertainment, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, which is scheduled to launch on PS5 and PC next year. Since Switch / Switch 2 owners won't be partaking in this release (yet), however, we're far more interested in the "announcement of new titles".</p>
<p>Arc System Works has developed and published a few key Switch titles in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear: Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/blazblue_cross_tag_battle">BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</a>, so we wouldn't be surprised to see something new for Nintendo platforms in the future.</p>
<p>Specifically, Taisuke-san is tied closely to the Guilty Gear series, and with Strive originally launching four years back, it could well be time to see what's next in the long-running fighting franchise.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be keeping a close eye on the upcoming showcase and will share any relevant news with you as soon as it happens.</p>
