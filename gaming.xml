                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner, promising more looter shooter shenanigans than ever before with its seamless open world design and exciting new traversal methods. There's a ton to look forward to when the game lands on September 12, and it's certain to keep you busy for many months beyond. But what if your friends are picking the game up on a platform you don't have? And what if you want to carry your saves between different ecosystems? We've got the answers about Borderlands 4's cross-play and cross-progression below.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-play?</h2><p>If you have friends playing on different platforms, we've got some good news for you. Borderlands 4 supports cross-play functionality across every platform, letting you team up with any of your pals for some lootin' and shootin'.</p><p>Before you can begin playing with anyone on another platform, however, you'll need to <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a SHiFT account</a>. This is a "Gearbox account," for all intents and purposes. Without one, you'll be limited to playing with players who own the game on your platform.</p><p>A SHiFT account has other benefits beyond just cross-play functionality, though. It also allows you to redeem SHiFT codes for special in-game items in the Borderlands series. These codes are often shared during various promotions on social media and beyond, so keep an eye out for them.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-progression?</h2><p>As for cross-progression, nothing has been shared about Borderlands 4's cross-save features quite yet. The franchise's two most recent games, Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, did not feature cross-save functionality. So, it would certainly be nice to finally be able to carry save data between different platforms--but we'll have to wait and see if Gearbox goes all-in on this feature. Even if they do, though, it's important to remember that you'd need to purchase the game on every platform you want to move saves between.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version following a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GOG launched a new website Friday where users can claim 13 games that have been delisted from other online sales portals for free. In a press release, GOG wrote that with the giveaway, it and the game publishers taking part are "taking a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves."</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's giveaway--found at the URL <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FreedomToBuy.games</a>, makes the games available for free to users for the next 48 hours. The titles are mostly sexually explicit and were recently delisted from other digital purchasing sites. GOG's site also includes an email link for developers or publishers interested in offering their games for free "as part of the protest."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an archival platform dedicated to protecting gaming history, we believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today--and decades from now," GOG wrote in a press release about the giveaway.</p><p dir="ltr">"We launched FreedomToBuy.games to make a statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder," it continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Sexually explicit games became the focus of controversy in July when thousands were abruptly removed from online game storefronts Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a>. Those removals were the result of pressure on the storefronts from payment processors like Mastercard and Visa to remove games featuring sexual content.</p><p dir="ltr">Payment processors were in turn pressured by a campaign by conservative anti-porn organization Collective Shout, which released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">open letter to payment processors on July 11</a>. The organization said it targeted the removal of games about "rape, incest, and child sexual abuse, and asked its members to <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">call and send emails to payment processors</a>. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported</a>, experts call this tactic "financial censorship," using financial institutions to sidestep platform rules by risking a seller's ability to do business at all. As a result of the campaign, hundreds of games were removed from Steam and, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/itchio-steam-collective-shout-sex-games-consume-me" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a>, more than 20,000 games marked "not safe for work" were removed from Itch. (Itch released a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> regarding the situation and has begun <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-listing some NSFW games</a> if developers choose to make them available for free.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253" data-ratio="0.43043295502312" data-width="2379" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253"></a><figcaption>freedomtoplay.games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backlash to the delisting began immediately, as many developers and players saw the situation as payment processors dictating to adults what content they were allowed to buy and play. Many developers also said that their games were caught up in the delisting sweep not because they contained pornographic content, but because they focused on LGBTQ elements and themes, or dealt with tough topics like sexual abuse.</p><p dir="ltr">Players and developers have taken to social media to put pressure of their own on payment processors to push against what they see as censorship. The International Game Developers Association released a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> where it called for "clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal" in this and similar situations, and directed developers to contact Visa and Mastercard directly, and to petitions from the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Change.org</a> pushing back on censorship from payment processors.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Both Mastercard and Visa have issued statements</a> saying the companies do not make moral judgments about merchandise sold by partners, and both suggested there was an issue of potential illegality at the heart of the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p dir="ltr">Visa made a similar statement to Polygon, saying it requires "enhanced safeguards" for merchants facing "an elevated risk of illegal activity."</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not make moral judgments on legal purchases made by consumers," the statement said. "Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p><p dir="ltr">No claims of potential illegality have been made about any games removed from platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's FreedomToBuy.games website leads with a statement that could be seen as addressing the legality argument.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some games vanish. Not because they broke the law but because someone decided they shouldn’t exist," the site reads. "For 48 hours, these games are free, because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it."</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>

The studio will allegedly work to overhaul the story in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4's struggles have also apparently resulted in the removal of Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore, and the shifting of creative director Hogarth de la Plante into a publishing role. Employees were told in a recent all-hands that the company needs to become, per Bloomberg, "more agile and efficient," which has some workers afraid layoffs may be on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games confirmed Gilmore and de la Plante's role changes to Bloomberg, and shared the following statement:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg's report also revealed that a BioShock 1 remake was in development at 2K, but was canceled earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We first heard reports that BioShock 4 was in development <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">way back in 2018</a>, when it was still apparently pretty early in the process. The following year it was officially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber</a>, but IGN was told at the time that the team was at "the earlier end of our process." It was also confirmed that original BioShock creative director Ken Levine was not working on the game, but was instead focusing on his own project, Judas, at Ghost Story Games (it's due. However, a number of other BioShock veterans were said to be working on it, including de la Plante, art director Scott Sinclair, and design director Jonathan Pelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, we've gleaned very little in the way of details on BioShock 4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a> is primarily a show about the news – and there’s plenty of talk about The Issues on this week’s episode – but sometimes a moment stops you dead in your tracks, and you’ve got to share it with the world. That could aptly describe both Chris Plante’s sandwich story and my experience of hearing him tell it. Anyway, without further ado…</p><p>Well, with a bit more ado: This week Chris (Person) and I are joined by an additional <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris (Plante)</a> – and also, to complete the bit, I’ve legally changed my name to Chris. We begin by discussing Plante’s life following his tenure as editor-in-chief at Polygon, which came to <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an abrupt halt earlier this year</a> for reasons with which Aftermath readers and listeners are depressingly familiar. On the upside, he’s launched a new show, <a href="https://shows.acast.com/post-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Post Games</a>, and it’s very good!&nbsp;</p><p>We discuss the whys and hows of his interview-focused podcast before delving into the big news of the week: Incensed by the removal of NSFW games on Itch and Steam following pressure from payment processors – which, in turn, were pressured by an activist group called Collective Shout – artists and fans have <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off a mass call campaign</a> of their own, targeting Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe specifically. Will it work? And in what universe is it appropriate for bank companies and payment processors to even be making decisions about what we’re allowed to watch and play in the first place?&nbsp;</p><p>Then Chris (Person) enthuses about <em>Death Stranding 2</em> – which he recently finished – and Chris (Plante) tells the wildest story about a sandwich any of us have ever heard.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can afford a really long sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for clarity, but certainly not length (of sandwich)):</p><p><strong>Person: </strong>Battery Park is an unnatural place, physically. It shouldn’t exist. It has one of the best weird movie theaters: the Regal down there. Because nobody knows that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Plante: </strong>When we lived there, we went there all the time, and I… can I share a really quick Regal story? Because it’s one of the most bonkers things.&nbsp;</p><p>So my wife and I, we were dating at the time, and we both got off work. She was working in production; I was freelance. Anyway, we were like “Oh, we want to go see <em>Edge Of Tomorrow: Live, Die, Repeat</em>, and we can go do it in the middle of the day. It’s gonna be, like, Tuesday at 10:40 AM.” And we go down to this theater, and as you’re describing, nobody knows it exists despite it being humongous – built into a skyscraper on the southwest side of Manhattan. It just does not make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>So we go in, and we go up this giant cavern, and we go into the movie. It’s 10:40 on a Tuesday. Nobody’s there at 7 PM on a Friday, so it’s empty. We sit, and this one dude comes in right as the trailers are starting, and he’s wearing the biggest trench coat I’ve ever seen, and he’s holstering something in it that looks like it’s about, like, two or three feet tall and thin. And he really does not want us to see it. We are at this point like “Well, this isn’t great.”</p><p>The trailers start, and every time a sexy thing happens in a trailer, this dude just goes “Mmmm.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh no.</p><p><strong>Person:</strong> Don’t like that.</p><p><strong>Plante</strong>: The whole time! So we’re like “Oh noooooo.” And then we’re like “Do we move?” We were doing that thing where you look at each other but you don’t want to say anything, and you’re kinda mumbling. He was literally just a seat or two down.&nbsp;</p><p>And then as the movie starts, he reaches in, and we’re like “Well, here it is. This is the end for us.”</p><p>And he pulls out the biggest sub sandwich I have ever seen. HUUUUGE. And then he proceeds to, for the first half hour of this movie, duck-style eat this sandwich. It never leaves the front of his face. He never lowers it. It just begins outstretched and slowly disappears into his body. Tomato and lettuce and vinegar and olive oil are spilling everywhere. It’s somehow getting on us. But we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like being in the front row at Sea World.</p><p><strong>Plante:</strong> That scene in the movie where Emily Blunt – it’s in every trailer – where she bends down in a weird way, like yoga positions… the noise that came from this man. The mix of sexuality, joy, and hunger, I will never forget it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioshock-4-reportedly-in-trouble-with-major-narrative-and-leadership-changes-after-it-failed-a-review-from-take-two-leadership.1260303/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next game in the BioShock series, which is currently referred to as BioShock 4, is reportedly having some major problems in development, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA3NDMxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0Njc5MTE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEJXRTJHUTFZV1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Zt4Beo52NA1y9AxmXB4Bd38T64ITJqEG1fTMqnDAfZU">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> reports that it recently failed a check-in review with Take-Two and 2K leadership, which resulted in major changes being ordered to the game's narrative, and two of developer Cloud Chamber's creative leadership being removed from their roles into other areas of the company.</p>



<p>The report also reveals that a remake of the first BioShock game was in the works before it was "<em>shelved</em>" earlier this year, according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>







<p>Kelley Gilmore, studio head at Cloud Chamber, was removed from her role as studio head and moved into a position on the publishing side of things, as a result of BioShock 4 failing its recent review, and Hogarth de la Plante, creative director at Cloud Chamber, suffered the same fate, and is now in a publishing role. </p>



<p>2K reportedly told Cloud Chamber's staff that they need to be "<em>more agile and efficient,"</em> which Schreier adds now has staff concerned that layoffs are around the corner.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to Bloomberg in response to questions sent in regarding this report, 2K Games said, "<em>We are working hard to set </em><em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future. <em>Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path</em>." The same spokesperson also confirmed the role changes for Gilmore and de la Plante.</p>



<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been in development <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">in some form or another since 2015</a>, or should we say at least since then, as Schreier adds that the game has been in development for "<em>more than a decade</em>," referring to his prior reporting that Certain Affinity had been working on the next BioShock game since at least 2015.</p>



<p>We only (<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-new-game-top-secret-2k-studio/">officially</a>) learned that BioShock 4 was coming in 2019, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/">Cloud Chamber announced as the studio helming the project</a>. In 2023, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/">claims that the game had been internally rebooted for a second time</a>, after suffering a reboot in 2018. Last year, we saw Cloud Chamber looking to ramp up development with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/">multiple job listings posted</a>, and that was essentially the most recent sign of life we've seen from the studio on BioShock 4.</p>



<p>The lack of any concrete information on the game for more than a decade is as good a sign as any that it's struggling in development, because surely if it were anywhere near release, 2K and Take-Two would have already been shouting about it from rooftops. But today's report shows that Take-Two aren't convinced that BioShock 4 is where it needs to be yet.</p>



<p>Of course, there's a stark difference between what a great game looks like for bean-counting executives versus the developers actually working on it. There's more than a slight chance that this failure could be the result of Take-Two just not believing that the current path for BioShock 4 won't be the one that sells the most copies. That doesn't mean it isn't a great game in its current state.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's clear we'll have to continue waiting to see what happens with the next BioShock game. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025.1260300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Danny Shnorhokian has been going to Evo since before it was called that. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-best-moments-in-pro-gaming-history-5820907">The biggest fighting game event of the year</a> started as a small tournament back in the late ’90s called Battle by the Bay that focused solely on <em>Street Fighter</em>. Decades later, the annual event’s mainstage features everything from household names like <em>Mortal Kombat</em> to newer franchises like the anime fighter <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>. <em>Street Fighter</em> remains the top-billed event at every Evo though, and its legacy is inseparable from the passion and fandom that brings thousands of fighting game players to the Nevada desert each summer. That legacy includes the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series, which is returning to the main event at Evo 2025 for the first time in 15 years, and which all began with the 1996 arcade classic <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter.</em></p> <p>Most people first came to the flashy pixel art superhero crossover through <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2.</em> That’s what Shnorhokian started out playing in Southern California in the early aughts (he placed in the top 8 at Evo 2008). But he later doubled back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWwgYSQUG0">equally gorgeous, even more broken original</a>, and was inspired to start holding annual side tournaments for it during Evo. “In 2005, EVO moved to Vegas, and allowed players (like myself) to run a side tournament if you had the resources,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. Back then it required having the original arcade cabinets on site, even as modern fighting games migrated primarily to console. “Me and a player named Dogface organized a tournament, which had about 30 entrants! Players from all over the country and even Japan participated. So from 2005 to 2010, I helped organize tournaments for the game.”</p> <p>Things petered out after that, even as Evo itself became larger than ever. Fans of smaller arcade fighting game classics like <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> relied on online matchmaking services like Fightcade to stay connected. Last year, however, Shnorhokian was able to bring the game back to Evo ahead of Capcom releasing it on modern platforms as part of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classic</em>s. “This year, thankfully we can run it on Steam, and that makes it easier for everyone,” he said. “It has all three versions of <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em>, and people can use their own controller. Plus everyone can play this game at home and online to practice. A $50 game is a lot easier to get your hands on instead of a $300 arcade board.”</p> <p>Evo has changed a lot over the years, including being <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-buys-evo-1846507520">sold to Sony</a> during the pandemic and amid a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-street-fighter-pulled-from-evo-online-by-1844253712">sexual misconduct scandal</a>. Fan favorites like <em>Smash Bros.</em> are no longer at the event, but a greater emphasis on retro games has brought back many of the games that first ignited players’ imaginations in arcades years ago. 2024 saw the return of <em>Street Fighter 3: Third Strike</em> and this year it’s <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> 2’s turn. But it’s the dozens of side tournaments and casual after-hours meetups where the old arcade culture lives on most.</p> <p>“Sponsored teams with players competing on national television for millions of dollars is something I would never have imagined,” Shnorhokian said. “When I got $50 for Top 8 at EVO, that felt HUGE. It’s a whole different world now. But even with the ups and downs, I do love Evo. It’s a great chance to see old friends, make new ones, meet players from around the world, and share the love of fighting games. Even if it was just 2 people, I’d want to organize an <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> tournament. I love the game, and whoever wins cans say they’re the ‘World Champion.'”</p>  <p>He hopes it’s him, but this year’s event has 20 people registered so far, including the Japanese Evo 2025 Champion Momoten, last year’s runner-up ken240sx, and fellow tournament organizer Majin Obama. “Infinite combos are definitely going to be done throughout the tournament,” Shnorhokian said. “It’s the person who has the patience to land the hit that’s going to make them the winner.”</p>  <p>The<em> X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> side tournament kicks off at 7:00 p.m. ET, but the rest of Evo will go throughout the weekend and late into Sunday night. Games begin each day around 1:00 p.m. ET across half a dozen livestreams culminating in the final top 8 for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> on August 3 around 11:00 p.m. ET. A full schedule of the event can found <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic and Paraglacial have announced Fatekeeper, a new first-person fantasy RPG that is set to head into PC Early Access this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fatekeeper | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9xHZodgC2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Fatekeeper promises reactive combat, rich progression and a handcrafted world, inviting players to visit ancient battleground, ruins and forests to uncover relics and lore to what occurred in each area, shaping your adventure and facing enemies as you go.</p>
<p>While it has a narrative path to follow, the intention is to make exploration feel rewarding. Of course, you’ll have your own character progression to shape, mastering weapons and armour, and with every encounter and choice feeding into the overarching tale.</p>
<p>Fatekeeper is in development at new studio Paraglacial, which is formed by former Grimlore Games developers who worked on SpellForce 3. Grimlore Games, of course, is currently working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>, which <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/titan-quest-2-early-access-release-date-is-today/">just went into Early Access today</a>!</p>

		<p>Who doesn’t like surprises? Having been teasing that a release date would be revealed during the THQ Nordic showcase, it was announced during the show that, actually, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a> Early Access launch is today! The game is out right now!</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grimlore are aiming to have the full launch of Titan Quest 2 in your hands by the end of 2026, and look to flesh the Early Access release out with a character creator, crafting and transmogrification, arcane abilities, new masteries and more. &nbsp;that let you wield your chosen armaments while appearing as heroic as a demigod. New masteries await, shrouded in mystery, offering paths of power not yet walked. Realms unseen and foes unknown gather beyond the mists, waiting for champions worthy of their wrath.</p>
<p>Those who are lured to the combat and action of ancient mythology will be greeted with a reduced price. The full 1.0 release will have a $49.99 / €49.99, but that is cut down to $29.99 / €29.99 during Early Access, and the first week comes with a 20% discount down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">Announced during the 2023 showcase,</a> Titan Quest 2 will be a true action RPG in the same vein as the original Titan Quest and the genre’s dominant series, Diablo. Still set within ancient Greek mythology, the game will feature its adventuring within picturesque open world environments, while battling everything from the Stymphalian birds to giant crabs.</p>

<p>Grimlore Games has been crafting the game with hand-composed enemies encounters, designing enemy types to have complimentary attacks and abilities, and then placing them together in ways that they can use actual tactics to come and have a go at you. Boss fights will then be unique encounters that challenge you with individual abilities and tactics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The most influential Japanese TTRPG is getting an official English translation. Mugen Gaming has announced they will be localizing <em>Sword World RPG</em>, a TTRPG so popular that it culturally eclipses <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p>



<p>According to a report <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/sword-world-rpg/crushed-dnd-english-translation" rel="nofollow">by Wargamer</a>, Mugen Gaming has announced a partnership with <em>Sword World RPG's</em> original publisher, Group SNE, to localize the TTRPG to English-speaking territories around the world.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-world-rpg-english-release-promo-banner.jpg?itok=6B2uGhBv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-world-rpg-english-release-promo-banner.jpg?itok=z3IYH5VO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To this end, Mugen Gaming will be launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter sometime in 2026. The campaign will be to localize the <em>Sword World 2.5 Core Rulebook</em>. In addition, Mugen plans to support the game long-term, providing localizations of expansions, supplements, and prewritten adventures.</p>

<p>The cultural space <em>Sword World RPG</em> has in Japan cannot be understated. It started when Ryo Mizuno and his friends played a translated version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons red box. This resulted in the "replay" write-ups, essentially the earliest form of Actual Play, that would become the blockbuster fantasy novel and anime series, <em>Record of Lodoss War</em>.</p>

<p>With a passion for the hobby ignited, Mizuno and his friends founded Group SNE to pursue official TTRPG publishing projects. This led to <em>Sword World RPG</em>, an enduring franchise still going strong after 35 years and over 10 million in sales. It is notable for using a simplified 2d6 system, cinematic battles, an open multiclass system, and adventures designed to make each session feel like an episodic anime arc.</p>

<p>The English localization of <em>Sword World RPG</em> is a natural extension of the growing popularity of TTRPGs as a hobby. While we've seen more niche experiences arrive overseas like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/japanese-rpg-picaresque-roman-comes-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Picaresque Roman,</em></a><em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Household</a>,</em><em>&nbsp;</em>and select entries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bouken's catalog</a>, Sword World finding a new audience may handily coincide with rising competition for D&amp;D's market share such as Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-darrington-press-has-announced-for-daggerheart-at-gencon-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> and MCDM's <em>Draw Steel</em>.</p>

              <p><span>It’s been 12 years since the last </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game and five years since 2K founded a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber to develop a new entry in the beloved shooter franchise. However, it sounds like we’re going to be waiting a bit longer for whatever the fourth </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game ends up being, as a new report from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span>indicates that Cloud Chamber has hit a snag in development, resulting in a leadership shake-up.</span></p> <p><span>The story says that the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> “failed a review by executives” at publisher 2K Games. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>‘s sources, the game’s narrative was a sore spot in the internal evaluation and is now being revamped. Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore has reportedly been removed from her position, and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been moved to a publishing role. Developers at the studio are worried that broader layoffs may follow after they were told in an all-hands meeting that Cloud Chamber needs to be “more agile and efficient.” A 2K representative told </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> that the publisher believes the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> is already “a good game” but it is “committed to delivering a great one.”</span></p> <p><span>Buried at the very end of the </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>story is confirmation that 2K was also working on a </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> remake, but that has since been shelved.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>series has been MIA for over a decade, with the last game in the series being </span><i><span>Bioshock Infinite</span></i><span> in 2013. It was followed by a two-part DLC called </span><i><span>Burial at Sea</span></i><span>, which bridges the gap between </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s airborne world of Columbia and the underwater city of Rapture from the first two games. Ken Levine, the original game’s lead, went on to found Ghost Story Games and is working on </span><i><span>Judas</span></i><span>, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642"><span>sure looks like a spiritual successor to </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

		<p>THQ Nordic has announced a Sacred 2 Remaster, a modernised version of the 2008 action RPG, coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sacred 2 Remaster | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2YzPPceRfyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The remaster is in development by Jumpgate and SparklingBit, revitalising the game with high resolution textures and improved lighting effects, improved combat, a modernised UI, and bugfixes for the game. This will also include all of the expansions and updates previously released for the game, and I think you can see from the trailer that this will still look and feels like a game from 2008.</p>
<p>A prequel to the original Sacred, this game takes players to the world of Ancaria as it’s on the precipice of disaster. T-Energy, the power source that helped to bring prosperity to the world, has been twisted and corrupted to bring conflict and chaos. Six heroes step forward, each with their own path and story to explore in this world.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatekeeper-is-a-new-first-person-action-rpg-inspired-by-dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic.1260213/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025, the publisher announced a new dark fantasy game called Fatekeeper. This project is in development at a small studio in the German Alps, which is home to around ten former Spellforce III developers from Grimlore Games.</p>



<p>The idea behind the project came from a discussion about Hellraid, Techland's game, which seemed like it would finally follow in the footsteps of Arkane's classic Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. The developers felt (rightfully so, I might add) that Dark Messiah of Might and Magic was the first game to make first-person melee action combat feel really cool.</p>



<p>They were also disheartened when Hellraid turned out into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-hellraid-review-hellish-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small DLC pack for Dying Light</a> instead of the full-fledged standalone game that had originally been promised. Following that news, they decided to take matters into their own hands and create their own take on this oft-neglected genre. Thus, Fatekeeper was born, a title with modern graphics (it is powered by Unreal Engine 5), classic RPG elements, and first-person melee action combat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fatekeeper Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbCAMqhNfzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Every item in the game can be inspected in the menu, and a lot of the items have hidden mechanics that are unlocked only after inspecting them properly. Following the inspiration of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Fatekeeper also allows for deep interactions with the environment, especially when using telekinesis on various objects and characters.</p>



<p>The developers are still working on the progression systems, such as the skill trees, so they haven't been shown yet. However, they promised progression would have considerable depth, like any other system in the game.</p>



<p>Fatekeeeper will be semi-linear. It's not an open world title, but the maps have been designed so that players can devise a lot of paths. While not as hard as a Souls game, this title should also provide plenty of challenge to players who seek that in games.</p>



<p>Frankly, it's about time that someone had such an idea and implemented it. Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is long overdue for a spiritual successor, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic have confirmed a new release window for the Gothic 1 Remake, which was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1297900/announcements/detail/519700531080333166">previously</a> set to arrive before the end of 2025, will now launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in early 2026. The delay is confirmed alongside the debut of a new gameplay trailer, and the release of a demo for the game finally coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>



<p>There's been a demo available for PC players to try out for months now, while console players have been left out of the loop. Now, PS5 and Xbox Series owners can try out the remake for themselves, ahead of its launch sometime in early next year.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Gothic 1 Remake was first announced all the way back in 2019, with a surprise teaser demo to gauge players' interest. However, it wasn't until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-gothic-remake-is-happening-after-all-and-itll-be-grittier-than-the-demo/">2020</a> that players knew the remake would be happening for sure. </p>



<p>By the time it arrives in early 2026, it'll be nearly seven years from its announcement to its release, and it'll be nearly 20 years since the last time a new Gothic game was released. There's no indication yet that Alkimia Interactive and THQ Nordic are looking to make a brand new Gothic adventure, but if the coming remake is wildly successful, the chances of a new game in the series would greatly increase. </p>



<p>We'll find out sometime early next year if this remake has been worth the wait, and if there's any chance at more Gothic games in the future.</p>



<p>Alongside the new gameplay shown in today's showcase and the news of the demo hitting consoles, THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive also announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-classic-1-3-are-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-in-2026/">original three Gothic games will be making their console debuts</a>, arriving on PlayStation and Xbox sometime in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Grimlore Games has Shadow Dropped Titan Quest II, Now Available in Early Access on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grimlore-games-has-shadow-dropped-titan-quest-ii-now-available-in-early-access-on-pc.1260201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, Grimlore Games confirmed that players anxious to jump into Titan Quest II would be able to do so with the game's early access launch set for sometime during the summer of 2025. Today, during its publisher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPVmpg6koqc">THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> for 2025, the studio shadow-dropped Titan Quest II, and you can rush over to Steam or the Epic Games Store to play it right now.</p>



<p>The new trailer that debuted during today's showcase features plenty of the action-packed scenarios players will encounter in their mythological journey through Ancient Greece, and a few of the quieter moments, as it shows off the work that Grimlore Games has put into improving graphical fidelity and combat.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Titan Quest II was initially set to arrive sometime during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025</a>, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/">announced in May</a> that it would be delayed until sometime in the summer. Which makes today's news hit even harder as a pleasant surprise for players who were hoping to have already put in dozens of hours to Titan Quest II.</p>



<p>Especially the players who got to participate in playtests for the game earlier this year. Even though the decision to delay the game came from these same playtests, Grimlore Games said that "<em>over 92%"</em> of the players who participated in the demo playtest it hosted came away with a 'positive' or 'very positive' rating of the game.</p>



<p>Of course, it wouldn't have been delayed if not for the myriad of issues players called out, like combat fluidity, skill targeting, and balancing, so everyone jumping into the early access launch today will be sure to pay attention to how those aspects of the game have changed in the last few months. And then everything will surely be tweaked further, as it begins its early access journey and the back-and-forth between the studio and community feedback that'll shape the game's development.</p>



<p>When the 1.0 version of Titan Quest II launches, it'll be available for $49.99 / €49.99. The early access version, however, is available on all platforms for $29.99 / €29.99, and if you grab it anytime within its opening week, you'll get it for 20% less, at $23.99 / €23.99.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/weappy-studio-debuts-the-eternal-life-of-goldman-gameplay-no-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a new 2D action-platformer from Weappy Studio, and is easily one of the most impressive-looking 2D platformers on the market, thanks to everything being animated by hand. We just got another look at some more gameplay during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase</a> today, with the game looking arguably even better than it has before, with some new shots in a new trailer. The only downside, though, is that there's still no release date in sight.</p>



<p>While we didn't get any release date news, we did get a bit more of an insight into the story of the game, with the gameplay being shown while a mom and her son discuss Goldman, with the mom becoming more agitated as she divulges how Goldman spent his life pouring over maps, looking for some kind of ultimate treasure that consumed his every waking moment.</p>



<p>By the end of the trailer, she's yelling at her son as she's clearly angry for having followed Goldman in the first place, with the last few lines eerily delivered by the young boy, who doesn't completely understand why or how he's upset his mother, but is now clearly scared of her to some degree, as we're left watching Goldman descend into a dark chasm, and we're left wondering what happened to the boy.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The manual animation style of The Eternal Life of Goldman calls back to games like Cuphead, which was also entirely animated by hand, and is regarded as one of the best 2D games in the past decade.</p>



<p>To be fair, Goldman still needs to stick the landing with its gameplay, Cuphead didn't win all its accolades based on looks alone. But if these trailers can be believed, 2D platforming fans will be in for a treat when The Eternal Life of Goldman launches. </p>



<p>Now if only we knew when it was launching.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-biggest-fighting-game-tournament-is-a-little-smaller-this-year-%E2%80%94-but-still-exciting.1260195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Evo 2025, the biggest fighting game tournament in North America, starts this weekend. If you tune into one of the nine different Evo Twitch channels, you’ll see some of the top players in the world compete in fighting game staples like <em>Street Fighter</em> and <em>Tekken</em> and newer games like <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> and<em> Rivals of Aether II</em>. The fighting starts today and lasts till late Sunday, August 3rd. Though this year is smaller, with fewer entrants than last year, there’s still plenty of reasons to watch.</p><p>While Evo remains one of the most highly attended fighting game tournaments in the world, this year, the number of entrants is slipping. Last year there were over 10,000 attendees — <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240724192201/https://evo.gg/news/evo-2024-record">setting a record for the highest number of unique competitors</a> in a fighting game tournament ever. This year, that number is significantly lower, with the number of entrants <a href="https://evo.gg/news/evo-2025-competitors-by-the-numbers">falling to just over 8,500</a>.</p><p>There could be a number of explanations for this. Economic volatility driven by inflation and policy has made the cost of living rise precipitously. When people have to think twice between groceries and a trip to Vegas (where Evo is annually held), the trip to Vegas typically loses out. Evo has also expanded, adding tournaments <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/17/12210570/evo-japan-announced/">first in Japan</a>, then <a href="https://evo.gg/events/2025-france">France</a>, and now <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singapore-to-host-evo-2026-the-world-cup-of-fighting-games">Singapore</a>, giving international players more of a choice of which events to attend.</p><p>Safety is potentially another reason why players are staying away. Evo is an internationally known and recognized tournament, and players from all over the world compete in this event. But in the US, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been <a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/politics-power/social-justice/immigrant-families-split-ice-deportations-REEFYKMZ6ZB43GYXWQN3WL4TXY/">conducting raids across the country</a>, ostensibly to arrest immigrants for deportation. But there have been numerous reports that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/634094/trump-dhs-arresting-palestine-student-activists-ice">legal residents</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-detained-us-citizen-l-charged-obstructing-arrest-rcna215481">US citizens</a>, and even <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-detention-of-european-and-canadian-tourists-creates-fear-over-traveling-to-america">tourists with valid visas</a> are being arrested and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/nx-s1-5441691/mahmoud-khalil-interview">detained for months</a> or even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/us/timeline-deportation-maryland-father-el-salvador-hnk">illegally deported</a>. In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, the Las Vegas Convention Center director of communications Erica Johnson wrote, “The [Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority]’s policy is to abide by all federal, state, and local laws and cooperate with the lawful execution of those.” Evo did not respond to requests for comment.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Joe Buglewicz / Getty Images</cite></p></div><p>Some notable international players, though, have decided to brave crossing the US border. Arslan “Arslan Ash” Siddique from Pakistan is registered to attend Evo, returning again to compete for another <em>Tekken </em>championship. Matías “Scorpionprocs” Martínez and Nicolás “Nicolas” Martínez, Chilean twins known for dominating <em>Mortal Komba</em>t tournaments, will also be competing.</p><p>The games themselves might also be contributing to reduced turnout. <em>Tekken 8</em> has the second-highest number of entrants after <em>Street Fighter VI</em>, but the game’s second season <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/fans-are-unhappy-with-tekken-8-season-2-heres-whats-causing-the-backlash/">was so poorly received</a> by players that <em>Tekken</em> executive producer Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1911974797225173345">wrote</a>, “I personally do not think this backlash is at all unjustified.” That frustration with the game might have led to its Evo player count being cut nearly in half, from 4,646 players in 2024 to just 2,521 this year.</p><p>Whatever the reason, this year’s Evo will be a slightly smaller but no less exciting affair that’s worth watching. Take a look at the schedule <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p><p>Even though <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fatal-fury-salvatore-ganacci-pushback-reveal">received criticism for some of its character choices</a>, I’m generally excited to watch any game I haven’t seen before. Evo 2025 is also adding two new streams to the schedule for people to watch any of the smaller games that are always featured at Evo but not large or notable enough to get main event stage billing. Also, my absolute favorite competitor, Dominique “Trans Rights” / “SonicFox” McLean, will be there, and I’ll watch them whenever he’s on.</p><p>Here’s some other things to look out for:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>Mortal Kombat</em> top 8 on Saturday, August 2nd, at 1PM ET: <em>MK 1</em> has the least amount of entrants that I have ever seen, and I want as many people to watch as possible so the competitors don’t feel so lonely.</span></li><li><span><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> top 8 on Sunday, August 3rd, at 4:30PM ET: I really want to see someone using Cristiano Ronaldo lose badly.</span></li><li><span><em>Street Fighter 6</em> top 8 on Sunday, August 3rd, at 11PM ET: <em>Street Fighter 6</em> is the most popular game at Evo, boasting the highest number of entrants the last three years, and its finals are always events you wanna watch.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/717660/how-to-watch-evo-2025-las-vegas]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-nintendo-didn%E2%80%99t-raise-the-price-of-the-switch-2-yet.1260192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Just about every piece of hardware that Nintendo sells is getting a little more expensive in the US — with the exception of the Switch 2. That includes all models of the original Switch, a bunch of accessories, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">even a motion-activated alarm clock</a>. The changes were made ahead of sweeping Trump administration tariffs that are scheduled to go into effect in August, and they show Nintendo is leaning on a strategy that it has employed across its business: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671949/nintendo-switch-2-era-risks">largely avoiding risk</a>. Raising the price of a new console isn’t the best look, and so the company is trying to claw back some of that money in safer ways, without gambling on the success of its most important product.</p><p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">Nintendo announced</a> that these new prices would go into effect starting on August 3rd. The actual increase hasn’t been announced yet, but a since-removed listing from Target suggests that the console hikes could range from $30 for the base Switch model to $50 for the OLED version. The move follows similar increases in Canada, and Nintendo says they’re being implemented “based on market conditions,” which is corporate speak for tariffs. Notably absent from the list of impacted products is the Switch 2. Nintendo says that current-gen hardware, along with games and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions, “will remain unchanged at this time.”</p><p>So what’s the point of raising the price on old consoles and alarm clocks? Nintendo is infamous for being a fiscally conservative company, and it understands that, like everyone else, it will be impacted by the coming wave of tariffs. But Nintendo also knows that raising the price of the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/646776/switch-2-price-editorial-dollar-yen-exchange-rate-inflation">which was already controversially expensive</a> — less than two months after launch would not go down well. The early days of a console’s life are very important to help establish a baseline audience that a company can then build off of. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">And the Switch 2 is off to a great start</a>. Just this morning <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">the company announced</a> that it had sold nearly 6 million Switch 2 units since its launch in June.</p><p>It seems the company has decided that it’s worth eating whatever added costs come its way if it means a successful launch for the Switch 2 — that includes the impending 20 percent tariff on imports from Vietnam, where many of the consoles are produced. But the same can’t be said for the original Switch or products like Alarmo. At this point in time, sales of the first Switch aren’t as integral to Nintendo’s success, and so the company is comfortable raising its price in response to its own rising costs. The original Switch is less important now but it’s not insignificant; Nintendo noted in its most recent earnings that “demand for Nintendo Switch has remained after Nintendo Switch 2 launched in June.” And so it appears that Nintendo is trying to nickel and dime its way into making up some of what it will lose through the tariffs it’s forced to deal with, all without disrupting the Switch 2’s momentum.</p><p>This sort of risk-avoidance has become how Nintendo operates of late. While it often takes risks creatively, the company is much more shrewd from a business perspective. In its current incarnation Nintendo is an entertainment powerhouse that has expanded into film and theme parks, all while launching a successful new console. But in each instance the company has taken a relatively safe path forward, whether it’s partnering with an established animation studio like Illumination or a global theme park firm like Universal. The Switch 2 itself is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">an attempt to continue the original Switch’s success without changing things up all that much</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">Even the Nintendo Museum tries to present a safe, squeaky clean image of the company</a>.</p><p>The new price hikes are simply a way of applying that way of thinking to the current chaos of Trump’s tariffs. That said, they could also end up being a soft launch of sorts, a way for Nintendo to gauge reactions before it does anything more drastic. Right now it has decided that it’s worth eating those costs, but that might not always be true moving forward. As it noted in today’s announcement, “price adjustments may be necessary in the future.” We don’t know yet what that might look like, but we do know that Nintendo will do whatever it can to avoid disrupting the Switch 2’s chances at success.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/717611/nintendo-switch-price-increase-risk-safety]]></content:encoded>
