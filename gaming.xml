			<p>Playground Games has revealed the PlayStation 5 launch date for its award-winning game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>. The latest installment in the open world racing game franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-playstation-5-in-spring-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will debut on Sony's console</a> on April 29, although owners of the Premium Edition will be able to start roaming the Mexican country roads from April 25. Playground Games also revealed the technical details of this version, including the planned improvements for the PlayStation 5 Pro console:</p>
<p><em>Forza Horizon 5 on PS5 features two rendering modes to choose from: Performance (60fps) and Quality (30fps). On PS5 Pro, the Performance mode receives increased visual fidelity, while Quality mode adds ray traced car reflections to Races and Free Roam.</em></p>
<p>The launch on PlayStation 5 coincides with a major update called Horizon Realms, which will be available on all platforms. This new feature aims to let players immerse themselves in the history of the game's Evolving World updates. In Horizon Realms, players will get to explore twelve Evolving World locations: eleven of the best previously limited-time locations and the first-ever Stadium Track.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
</ul>
<p>Collecting new Horizon Realms exclusive awards will unlock four new Horizon Reward Cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 Lamborghini Revuelto</li>
<li>2023 Lamborghini Huracán Sterrato</li>
<li>2018 Lotus Exige Cup 430</li>
<li>2022 Hennessey Mammoth 6x6</li>
</ul>
<p>Playground has discussed two ways to experience Horizon Realms. In Skill Mode, the Forza Horizon 5 user picks one of the Realms to enter and try to get as many Skill Scores as possible. Each Evolving World will have its own Skill Score Leaderboard, and there will also be an overall Skill Score Leaderboard that adds up all the points you have banked on each Realm. Earning enough Skill Score will also unlock new player badges unique to Horizon Realms.</p>
<p>In Free Mode, leaderboards are cast aside to focus on the fun factor. &nbsp;having fun on their favourite realms. Players can drive solo or with friends, earn badges tied to previous content updates, and unlock accolades to earn #Forzathon points.</p>

<p>As a side note, it's possible April will be a month to remember for PlayStation 5 users when it comes to Microsoft game releases. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tom-warren-indiana-jones-for-ps5-is-targeting-an-april-release.1120953/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, MachineGames is aiming to launch the PS5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle in April, though that might still change.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-peanuts-brings-childhood-charm-to-classic-mystery-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new version of the iconic Clue board game is coming based on the world of Peanuts. The aptly named <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> reimagines the classic whodunnit mystery board game with the characters and iconography of the comic strip created by Charles Schulz.</p>

<h2>The <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Clue: Peanuts</em> board game is being developed by The Op under license of toy company giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-unveils-new-playing-to-win-strategy-expanding-their-reach-to-more-players" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hasbro</a>. The mystery at the heart of the game isn't a murder, but the disappearance of Linus' blanket. Players will step into the shoes of Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Lucy, and more to solve the classic Clue questions of Who, Where, and with What.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-peanuts-game-board.jpg?itok=ezG2B3Hw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-peanuts-game-board.jpg?itok=qvw8MFI_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The use of the <em>Peanuts'</em> license extends to the locations as well. Players will explore Lucy's psychiatric booth, the pumpkin patch, and Snoopy's doghouse to find clues, interrogate various supporting characters, and piece together the greater puzzle. The game is designed for 2-6 players ages 8 and up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At The Op Games we believe happiness is…playing board games with friends and family,” said Dane Chapin, CEO of The Op Games. “We’re excited to add CLUE: PEANUTS Edition to our growing line of PEANUTS titles in this special anniversary year, and fans can look forward to more of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and Snoopy just around the corner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peanuts is a syndicated Sunday comic strip written and illustrated by Charles Schulz. It debuted in 1950 and continued until Schulz died in 2000. By that time the comic had circulated in thousands of magazines across 75 countries. It is considered one of the most influential comic strips in history for it cementing the four-panel gag comic format, alongside philosophically and psychologically complex humor.</p>

<p>The last major project featuring the Peanuts gang was an animated movie in 2015 developed by Blue Sky Studios. It received positive reviews and was the 7th highest grossing animated film of that year.</p>

<p><em>Clue: Peanuts</em> is available now at physical and online retailers. It is being sold at an MSRP of $44.99.</p>

The Switch game seems like a significant departure from the untamed open zones of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, which is exciting because we don’t know what to expect. The stream gave us a trailer as well as a general breakdown, and we skimmed through both to see what details we could find. Here’s everything we noticed.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-recommend-id="image://36ee184a9960e112180eb234ced9b0c8" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer aims at a Fletchling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the best innovations <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>implemented was real-time capture mechanics. This included over-the-shoulder aiming which let you toss a Poké Ball at a wild critter and capture them without entering a battle. <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>didn’t quite match this. You could throw a ball at a Pokémon as a way of initiating battles, but you would still have to fight the monster before you could capture them. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks kind of like a mix of the two. You can still capture Pokémon without battling them, but it looks like it has a lock-on system similar to that in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> rather than the option to freehand it. Kind of a bummer, but hopefully it feels better when you’re playing it.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-recommend-id="image://4fad372785fbf29c7c91ae0ccd716623" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer throws a Pokeball at a Flaaffy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the great challenges of a <em>Pokémon </em>game is trying to capture a new addition without knocking them out. This is why abilities like False Swipe exist, which will leave a Pokémon with 1 HP rather than knocking it out. In the first <em>Legends: Z-A </em>trailer, we see a Flaaffy seemingly beaten in battle, but the player still captures it in a Poké Ball. If this is the case, it takes some of the risk out of battles, but will make it a lot easier to capture a rare Shiny or Legendary Pokémon.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-recommend-id="image://cca0cf0789231f6e8c46ca43899dd76b" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chikorita attacks Flaaffy with Razor Leaf with Disarming Voice on its ability wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile are the starters in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, which has fans convinced their final forms will each get Mega Evolutions. For Chikorita, its final stage is Meganium, and fans are theorizing its Mega Evolution might be a grass/fairy-type because of one small detail in the trailer. The Chikorita shown fighting the aforementioned Flaaffy knows the attack Disarming Voice, a fairy-type move Chikorita has historically never been able to learn. Could this be a hint that Chikorita’s move pool has been tweaked to prepare it for a fairy typing in the late game?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-recommend-id="image://7b0ffc8fc07d2713bc9ff2bcc0a21f09" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Totodile moves out of the way from a Rollout attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>’ battles were more cinematic than those in previous games, and part of what added to the chaotic nature of its fights were that you could move your character around as your Pokémon took part in the scrap. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, Game Freak is taking this a step further by integrating it into the battle mechanics. Positioning and timing are integrated into combat in ways they weren’t before, and as you run around your active Pokémon follows, setting up and avoiding attacks as they play out. So now you don’t just run around aimlessly during fights; you’re a more active participant in battles.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-recommend-id="image://3ec112048b7696a2133f05c74d47f911" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chikorita's ability wheel shows Leafage recharging." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of that new active system is that Pokémon attacks seem to have cooldowns. We can see when Chikorita is fighting Flaaffy that its moves have a timer before it can use them again. This makes sense given that timing seems to be a core part of battles this time around. Now you’ll have to make sure you’re well-positioned and can use the attack you need at the right time.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-recommend-id="image://1c470e8a9b7a842984062f71749d7f9c" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A trainer floats off a rooftop using their Rotom phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Legends: Z-A</em> takes place entirely in one city, it’s not too surprising that it’s doing away with some of the open-world traversal of <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> and <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. In those games, you would ride on Pokémon to get to high places, glide through the air, or swim across bodies of water. Based on what we can see in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, the only Pokémon you’ll be using to traverse will be your Rotom—which is in your phone—to float between rooftops. That’s a little disappointing considering riding the Hisui Pokémon in <em>Legends: Arceus </em>was one of the best parts about it, but it makes sense given the environment you’ll be inhabiting in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-recommend-id="image://98a3a7c17fbe8b5f0a10ee64d2aee145" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Urbain and Taunie in Legends: Z-A." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s become pretty common in <em>Pokémon </em>games to determine members of the supporting cast by which version of the protagonist you pick at the beginning of the game. In <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, if you pick the female character Akari, you’d meet the male protagonist Rei in the main story, and vice versa. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, it looks like you’ll meet one of two supporting characters called Urbain and Taunie depending on your character’s gender. We see what looks like a male protagonist meeting up with Taunie and Urbain chatting with a girl hero. The question is: will both characters essentially be model swaps of the same role, or will they have their own goals and quirks for us to learn?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-recommend-id="image://f7d6c3816848ba1d46959e431d5c4809" data-format="jpg" data-width="1362" data-height="766" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="AZ and Floette vibing in a hotel lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While this isn’t a hidden detail, it’s crazy to me that we’re just gonna gloss over AZ.

He is also an innocent babygirl who loves his Floette.

<p>A Minecraft Movie hits theaters on April 4, and the final pre-release trailer has been released by Warner Bros. Pictures. The trailer gives a deeper look into the movie’s world, creatures, mobs, and the Nether. </p>



<p>“Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn’t just help you craft, it’s essential to one’s survival!” the movie’s description reads. “Four misfits—Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison (Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks)—find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. </p>



<p>“To get back home, they’ll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Jack Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative…the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world.”</p>



<p>You can watch the new trailer for A Minecraft Movie below.</p>

                <p>A Good Snowman is Hard to Build is a delightful Sokoban-like puzzle game that challenges you to build a snowman in increasingly complex environments. Originally released in 2015, for the game's 10th anniversary, developer Draknek &amp; Friends decided to implement a unique weather-based pricing system in lieu of its normal price of $15.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWJIkfiKmQk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uWJIkfiKmQk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indie-studio-introduces-a-unique-temperature-based-pricing-system-for-its-snowman-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, over on the game's <a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a> page, the developer has dubbed the new model "pay what the temperature is." The price on Itch.io is set according to the current temperature in London in degrees Celsius every hour--for example, at the time of writing, the temperature is currently 8.3 degrees, meaning that the game is $8.30. This of course means that the game will be cheaper at night and during the colder winter months, and significantly more expensive during the summer months, which you might call thematically appropriate. In the case that London falls to 0 degrees Celsius or lower, the game will be free.</p><p dir="ltr">Because platforms like Steam don't allow this sort of price tomfoolery, this scheme is exclusive to the Itch.io storefront. The developers joke that those who are upset by its use of Celsius can opt to pay for Fahrenheit or Kelvin instead by using Itch.io's "pay what you want" feature. (For comparison, the current price would be $46.94 in Fahrenheit and $281.45 in Kelvin). Draknek &amp; Friends are currently working on its new game, The Electrifying Incident, which stars the same monster as A Good Snowman is Hard to Build.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/monaco-2-demo-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was a big fan of 2013’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/113020/Monaco_Whats_Yours_Is_Mine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Monaco</em></a>, a top-down, pixel art heist game with a <em>Rashomon</em>-esque plot. It was clearly meant to be played co-op, where your friends ruin your plans and then you all fight, but I mostly played it as a solo experience. It was a lot of fun that way–stealthing through its sprawling mansions, banks, discos, and art galleries until I ruined my plans all on my own, at which point I’d run around in a panic and then hide in a vent. Developer Pocketwatch announced a sequel in 2022; there’s currently a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> available as part of Steam Next Fest, which makes single-player a more viable way to play.</p><p>The core of <em>Monaco 2</em> is essentially the same as <em>Monaco 1</em>–a group of characters is drawn together to break into glamorous buildings, locate some coveted object, and try to get out alive–but how all that works has gotten an overhaul. Most noticeable is that the sequel has nixed the pixel art, and has shifted to an isometric perspective. I wasn’t quite sold on the game’s new look when it was first announced, having such fond memories of the first’s bright, blocky colors and relative simplicity. But the new style grew on me quickly while playing the demo; the more detailed art brings life to the levels, and the new perspective makes heists feel more akin to playing a <em>Hitman</em> level than the somewhat cerebral remove of the original’s overhead design. Levels feel busier, which makes them more engaging to move through, if not sometimes a bit more chaotic, especially when things go south.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Monaco 2 OFFICIAL Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKF0feOQcPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Developer Andy Schatz told Aftermath in an interview that some of the visual changes were due to ways Pocketwatch saw players struggle to understand the original. This is especially true of the way <em>Monaco 2</em> iterates on the first game’s most unique visual feature, which is that parts of a level outside your immediate vicinity were greyed out. Schatz said, “Some people's brains literally cannot parse [the original look]... and I wanted to be able to make the sequel something that more people could parse.” The original game had a blueprint vibe, which is preserved in the sequel through your ability to pore over the map before you start or during gameplay. But the moment-to-moment is different now; while in the first game, areas outside your line of sight were essentially invisible, here, you can see a lot more of their contents. This reduces some of the first game’s tendency to feel like a disco when things went haywire, but still maintains enough mystery to keep you on your toes. Schatz said, “There’s basically like a shadowing [in <em>Monaco 2</em>], but it's a more subtle shadowing that doesn't completely change the visual style of the region that is unseen versus the region that is seen.”</p><figure><figcaption>The original Monaco's line of sight</figcaption></figure><p>Drawing on the lessons learned from players over a decade of the first game influenced other changes for the sequel as well. One is the new way that characters work, especially when playing single-player. In the first game, you could only change characters when you died; here, you can swap them out at various checkpoints. While Schatz admitted <em>Monaco</em> will never have quite as much “riotous fun” in single-player as in co-op, he thinks the single-player experience in <em>Monaco 2</em> is better than in the first game. As a solo player, being able to change characters more often lessened the feeling that I was the wrong person for the job as I moved deeper into a level and faced new challenges.</p><p>The game’s eight characters fall into basic archetypes, each with their own distinct look and powers, like the ability to heal or a drone that can hack alarms. The variety within the team is a reflection of the heist movies <em>Monaco</em> is inspired by, in which Schatz said “the people within the crew are all unique from one another because they have a unique role within their team.” My favorite demo character was The Socialite, who has a little dog she can deploy to distract single guards. (Schatz told me that, alas, other players can’t pet the dog.) Playing alone, I’d use her in the early parts of a level, where her dog could handle the scattered enemies. When later areas got too populated, I’d swap to The Prowler and use her dash ability to sneak by multiple patrolling guards.</p><p>“The primary approach is really that we're designing for different player personalities and player styles more so than player skill,” Schatz said of the differences between the characters. “<em>Monaco</em> is designed around the idea that everyone always has the opportunity to be the hero under different circumstances.”&nbsp;</p><p>Characters also have “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063030/view/542222803385975570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trinkets</a>” they can unlock through diamonds earned by completing challenges; trinkets give characters new abilities at the cost of some of their health. Schatz said there’s more like 40 different characters, given how much a trinket can change your playstyle. He said that trinkets largely follow a certain progression: “For the most part, they all stay within the theme of the character. I did always try to make sure that there was one trinket that was like a speedrunning trinket, and another trinket that was a team-based trinket. Then the other two were typically just like, well, this would be a cool variation on the character. I generally tried to order their unlock order so the first one is, how do I make this character a little bit easier to play?”</p><figure></figure><p>Another change that makes single-player a little more approachable is the change to how weapons work. Schatz said he didn’t like the way you picked your weapon at the beginning of a <em>Monaco 1</em> stage, and then unlocked ammo for it while collecting coins scattered around a level. In <em>Monaco 2</em>, you spend coins to unlock different weapons you find, which, like the ability to change characters, gives you more gameplay options. In the first game, similar to how I sometimes felt I was stuck with the wrong character, I’d also feel like I had the wrong tool. In the demo, I could deploy a smoke bomb to hide from guards, flee to a stairwell, then swap to a disguise to calmly stroll through the next floor. It’s not the same team-based vibe as a heist movie or co-op play, but it made me feel clever, and gave me more options when I didn’t have teammates to get me out of a jam.</p><p>But no amount of character or weapon swaps can prevent a <em>Monaco</em> level from devolving into chaos, no matter how much I want to play it like the <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perfect stealth game</a>. It’s not that the enemies are challenging–Schatz said the game’s guards are “particularly dumb”--but that running afoul of one has a cascading effect. You can’t really fight them head-on– Schatz said that “everyone always asked for combat back in the day [of <em>Monaco 1</em>], they wanted to be able to fight the guards... [But] that's just not how <em>Monaco 1</em> was: plan A is stealth and then plan B, we called it the ‘oh shit’ button.” Fleeing from one guard inevitably runs you into another, and they all start to chase you as you race around corners and deal with the game’s particular take on line-of-sight. Schatz said the game treats enemies like “a flock as a whole, and a giant system where you’re making waves.” This brings a slapstick vibe to things going wrong that feels core to the experience of <em>Monaco</em>, and I was glad to see it hold true for the sequel.</p><p>“The only piece of code that is literally shared between <em>Monaco 1</em> and <em>Monaco 2</em> is the aggro algorithm, the algorithm for how guards see you, how they perceive you, and when they chase you,” Schatz said. “That's the one that was like, there's special sauce in there that we don't want to mess with.”</p><figure></figure><p>This idea of enemies as a whole, rather than individuals, also feels like it fits with the nature of the heist movies <em>Monaco </em>is inspired by, which Schatz described as being about “a band of misfits that gather together to outsmart the squares.” The original <em>Monaco</em> was inspired by the heist movies of its time–Schatz cited Guy Ritchie movies and <em>The Usual Suspects</em>–but heists, and the nature of heist movies, has changed since then. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgdy5e3neko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern heists</a>, Schatz said, “almost all involve some form of digital trickery… They often are multi-stage at this point… And that was something that kind of went into the original thoughts of some of [<em>Monaco 2</em>’s] story.” We only get a glimpse of that story in the demo, and what I played feels physical in the way of “classic” heists, letting you jetset around locations and put yourself in harm’s way, while also feeling more high-tech, such as through the presence of robot guards. “It’s not so much a sci-fi story, but it’s sort of mildly so,” Schatz said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is being published by Humble Games, which faced what owner Ziff Davis called a “<a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructuring</a>” over the summer, but which to many looked more like a closure. Humble initially brought in third party The Powell Group to continue its <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/indie-devs-working-with-humble-games-were-also-blindsided-by-the-publisher-reportedly-laying-off-all-employees-this-will-have-drastic-consequences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games</a>, and, later, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/humble-games-calls-in-good-games-group-for-support-following-restructure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">external help</a> in the form of a company founded by ex-Humble employees.&nbsp;When asked how this had affected the game, Schatz acknowledged that there was “healthy and valid skepticism of the initial statements that it's a restructuring.” He said Humble has been “surprisingly really supportive… I say ‘surprisingly;’ I mean just, even I had that kind of skepticism when it all went down. I was panicked, but… they've been supporting [<em>Monaco 2</em>] beyond even sort of initial promises. No corners have been cut; in fact, corners have been added… I have been given every sign that they are extremely excited about <em>Monaco</em>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Monaco 2</em> is set to release this year. I’m enjoying my time with the demo and the way it feels more suited to my solo circumstances, even if solo play isn’t the ideal. (<em>You</em> try making plans to game with friends as a middle-aged adult.) Schatz told me, “I actually think that one of the reasons that Pocketwatch has been successful over the years is… [trying] to discover new niches of people that were underserved by the games that they know and love. And in this case, we're making a sequel… so there are some ways in which we said, if there is something that works better for this game, we can't be afraid to let it go.</p><p>“We've tried to preserve everything we could about the spirit of the original, and the emotions that you have and the types of things you think about while you're playing… [We didn’t want to] change that feeling of <em>sneak, sneak, sneak, CHAOS</em>. That is <em>Monaco</em>.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-cleaver-chefs-knife-caidao-cck-sbz"><h3>Everyone Should Have A Chinese Chef’s Knife</h3></a><p>My Chan Chi Kee KF1812 caidao is one of my most prized possessions and I use it for basically everything.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-bezos"><h3>Jeff Bezos Presents: The News</h3></a><p>Bezos' new vision for The Washington Post's opinion section will destroy the paper</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The integrated heat spreaders put on CPUs at the factory are not the most thermally efficient material you could have on there, but what are you going to do—rip it off at the risk of killing your $500 chip with your clumsy hands?</p>
<p>Yes, that is precisely what enthusiastic overclockers have been doing for years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decapping">delidding</a>, or decapping (though the latter term is used less often in overclocking circles), chips through various DIY techniques, allowing them to replace AMD and Intel's common denominator shells with liquid metal or other advanced thermal interface materials.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, it can be nerve-wracking, and things can go wrong in just one second or one degree Celsius. In <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/extreme-overclocker-recommends-heating-arrow-lake-cpus-to-165-degrees-celsius-before-delidding-the-cpu-has-to-be-hot-enough-so-the-indium-melts-but-not-too-hot-to-not-damage-the-smds">one overclocking forum thread</a>, a seasoned expert noted that Intel's Core Ultra 200S spreader (IHS) needs to be heated above 165° C for the indium (transfer material) to loosen. But then the glue holding the IHS is also loose at this temperature, and there is only 1.5–2 millimeters of space between IHS and surface-mounted components, so it's easy for that metal IHS to slide off and take out a vital component with it. It's quite the Saturday afternoon hobby.</p>
<p>That is the typical overclocking bargain: You assume the risk, you void your warranty, but you remove one more barrier to peak performance. Now, though, Thermal Grizzly, led by that same previously mentioned expert, Roman "der8auer" Hartung, has a new bargain to present. His firm is delidding AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D CPUs with its own ovens and specialty tools, then <a href="https://www.thermal-grizzly.com/en/amd-tg-delidded-cpu/s-tg-del-cpu-001">selling them with two-year warranties</a> that cover manufacturer's defects and "normal overclocking damage," but not mechanical damage.</p>

Now, Xbox Game Studios has revealed that Forza Horizon 5 will be arriving on PS5 on April 29. In a new trailer for the game, players are invited to revisit the Horizon Realms, which includes locations that were previously only available for a limited time, as well as the new Horizon Stadium Circuit.</p><p>Since the game is pulling into its new home on Sony's flagship console, Forza Horizon 5 is getting PlayStation Trophies, in-game badges, and accolades that can allow players to unlock new cars. All of the perks from the previously released versions of the game will be included at launch, including almost 900 cars and 40 themed updates. However, the paid expansions, Rally Adventure and Hot Wheels, will still be sold as separate DLC.</p>

                <p>In 2017, Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene carved out a space for himself in the battle royale genre with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-review/1900-6416830/" data-ref-id="1900-6416830">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. Later this year, Greene's new title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-next-game-prologue-i/1100-6472284/" data-ref-id="1100-6472284">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, is sending players up against an enemy they can't simply shoot or kill. As shown in the new trailer below, Prologue is a survival game in which there's nothing more dangerous to the player than the brutally cold weather and the harsh environment of the woods.</p><p>Prologue's 64-square-km maps are procedurally generated, with millions of possible combinations. The goal of each game is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located in each map. To do so, players will have to scrounge for supplies and gear, battle hunger and thirst, and take shelter from the elements to prevent their untimely demise. The cold itself is your primary adversary, and there's more than one way it can kill you. For example, slipping on some icy terrain can sometimes lead to a fatal end. And if you happen to be outside during a blizzard, it may go very badly for you.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Prologue: Go Wayback! | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While the weather can be overwhelming, Prologue will give players the tools to help them recognize when the temperatures are going to rapidly drop or when they need to immediately find shelter. Players can also fix items they find and temporarily take refuge in cabins. But staying in one place isn't a long-term strategy, and extraction is only possible at the weather station.</p><p>PlayerUnknown Productions has previously stated that Prologue is part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">a plan for three games</a>, which includes an upcoming title called Project Artemis. PUBG publisher Krafton and Nvidia have recently shared plans to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-and-nvidia-reveal-new-ai-powered-characters-designed-to-act-like-real-people/1100-6528667/" data-ref-id="1100-6528667">AI-powered teammates in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> that can act more like real people. Krafton is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/" data-ref-id="1100-6529319">PUBG: Blindspot</a>, which will be the first PUBG spin-off aside from PUBG Mobile.</p><p>Early access for Prologue: Go Wayback will begin this summer on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate has been announced by Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau, a brand new side-scrolling action game that’ll probably make you think you’re playing a remaster of an early 90s movie tie in. It’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC on 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, this is a real love letter to the film and 16-bit video games, but with all the potential that funnelling that through modern hardware can produce. There’s really slick animation, the sprite work is really high detail, and then there’s just so many moments that are being recreated from the film – in addition to some original stages.</p>
<p>Play as Sarah Connor, the T-800, and John Connor in the far future missions, with a blend of beat ’em ups, shooting and stealth.</p>
<p>This could be the Terminator 2 tie-in game that we never had. Except… we did have them. Lots of them. There was a computer game by a studio called Dementia – really quite a bad name for a games company – an arcade shooter by Midway, a Game Boy game by Bits Studios, and a 1992 NES game by Software Creations. Bits Studios returned in 1992, making a 16-bit version for SNES and Mega Drive. I have no idea if any of these games were good.</p>

<p>So, perhaps Bitmap Bureau design director Mike Tucker can put it a different way:&nbsp;“It’s a love letter to 80s/90s arcade games and we feel like it’s the T2 game we should have had back in our youth.”</p>
<p>To go alongside the game reveal and announcement is a Making Of video, where Tucker utters these words:</p>
<p><iframe title="Making Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPMqA-qqfWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Intriguingly, the way that the game has been developed is intended to allow them to port the game back to classic machines. The current console releases are set for 5th September, with other, older platforms yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Xbox’s excellent arcade racer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5 on 29th April, it’s been confirmed, narrowing down the spring release window that was previously revealed.</p>
<p>This will also come alongside an update for the game on Xbox and PC that introduces the Horizon Realms</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 - Horizon Realms Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wWd6ox2dgec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 release of Forza Horizon 5 will come in multiple editions, and with early access for pre-orders starting on 25th April. As with Xbox Series X, the PS5 will have a 60fps Performance and 30fps Quality mode. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will also have the same frame rate targets, but Performance mode will have increased visual fidelity, while PS5 Pro Quality mode will add ray-traced car reflections to races and free roam – these are otherwise limited to photo modes.</p>
<p>Horizon Realms will adapt the previously time-limited events from the Evolving World update, bringing back 11 locations and adding one more. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stunt Park</li>
<li>Ice Rink</li>
<li>Oval Track</li>
<li>Summer Party</li>
<li>Neon Airstrip</li>
<li>Día de Muertos</li>
<li>Winter Wonderland</li>
<li>Lunar Drift Arena</li>
<li>Retrowave Highway</li>
<li>Cars and Coffee</li>
<li>Stadium Maze</li>
<li>Horizon Stadium Circuit (new)</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all be played in either Skill Score, which has you try to bank enough points to climb a leaderboard, or Free mode, which is all just about messing around and earning Badges.</p>
<p>It’s still a bit weird seeing Xbox first party exclusives popping up on PlayStation, but here we are. They even have their trailers appear on the PlayStation YouTube channel these days!</p>
<p>The port is being developed by Panic Button in collaboration with Turn 10 Studios and Playground Games, and will be like-for-like in terms of content with all the previously released car pack, and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/27/forza-horizon-5-hot-wheels-review/">Hot Wheels</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/24/forza-horizon-5-rally-adventure-expansion-revealed/">Rally Adventure</a> expansions also available.</p>
<p>This follows on from comments by Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who said in the last few weeks that “To keep games off other platforms… it’s not a path for us.” This certainly tied in with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/">the latest rumours</a> that had other core Xbox franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag-microsoft-flight-simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> potentially coming to PlayStation, and with Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-confirmed-for-may/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/rumours-grow-of-starfield-indiana-jones-more-xbox-games-coming-to-ps5/">Indiana Jones</a>, and Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">The Outer Worlds 2</a> already confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forza Horizon 5 Review (Xbox Series X in 4K 60fps)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEl0KBy5I-U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forza Horizon 5 is the latest in Playground Games’ spectacular open world arcade racing spin-off to the main Forza Motorsport series. Where previous games took us to Australia and the UK, Forza Horizon 5 takes players to a gorgeous approximation of Mexico, really showcasing the variety of environments that you can find in the country.</p>
<p>Originally released in late 2021 across Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and PC, t<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/halo-infinite-20-million-players-forza-horizon-5-18-million-but-how-many-bought-the-games/">he game set records for Xbox Game Pass at the time</a>. It’s over three years old now, and has had countless updates, car packs and a pair of great expansions as well. PlayStation 5 owners are in for a treat when it arrives.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon 5 review</a>, we scored the sequel a sublime 9 out of 10 with Dom saying, “Forza Horizon 5 continues the series’ legacy, usurping Forza Horizon 4 as the new pinnacle of open-world racing and as a graphical showcase for the new generation of Xbox console.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-reaction-time-and-does-it-make-you-better-at-cs2-or-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The <a href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reaction Time test</a> on the Human Benchmark website is a common destination for Counter-Strike 2 or VALORANT players who want to quantify their brain’s reflexes. But what does reaction time actually mean, and how much of an advantage does a faster mental response time give players?</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what reaction time is, what the Reaction Time test actually is grading, and what it means as a CS2 or VALORANT player.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-reaction-time">What is Reaction Time?</h2>



<p>Reaction time is defined as the amount of time it takes for an individual to recognize and respond to a visual and/or auditory stimulus. For gamers, and for players of tactical shooters like CS2 or VALORANT, reaction time is how long it takes for a player to respond to a specific visual or audio cue. This could be an enemy or grenade appearing on screen, or the sound of the bomb being planted or an ability being popped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="donk INHUMAN Reaction Flick (with pov)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKG99h5gF3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When CS2 or VALORANT players talk about “reaction time,” they’re typically referring to the time it takes a player to react (i.e. shoot) an enemy that appears on screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-reaction-time-test">What is the Reaction Time test?</h2>



<p>The Reaction Time test on the Human Benchmark website is described there as a “simple tool to measure your reaction time.” It measures the milliseconds it takes for you to recognize when the red box turns green and then click. When you perform the test, you are given an average reaction time after four applications of the test.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the site, the median reaction time is 273 milliseconds, while the average is 284 ms, though input/monitor lag can play a factor. These numbers are produced from over 81 million reaction time clicks. Top esports pros score much higher though. During a recent stream, VALORANT star Tyson “TenZ’ Ngo <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1894802864910016862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casually performed the test</a> and scored 138 ms, more than twice as as fast as the test’s average.</p>



<p>The Human Benchmark website also recently added a simplified “aim trainer” game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-practice-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’d find in programs like AimLabs</a>. This test is actually a better method of grading a gamer’s reaction time, since it includes moving the mouse to hit your targets. The median reaction time in the aim trainer game is 400 ms.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-important-is-reaction-time-in-games-like-cs2-or-valorant">How Important is Reaction Time in Games Like CS2 or VALORANT?</h2>



<p>High reaction time is important in games like CS2 or VALORANT, but high reaction time doesn’t guarantee success. Of course, higher reaction times will help players win aiming duels or turn away from flashbangs. But fast reactions are only a small part of the skillset players need to go from casual to competitive to professional.</p>



<p>Skills like communication, coordination, emotional maturity, and the ability to read or predict enemy actions are all crucial. Without them, you’d just have players going by instinct, trying to make hero plays. A player that can react and make a play in a bad situation is great, but so is a player that can predict or avoid getting into dangerous situations altogether. If your reaction time is slow, that can be improved by training or improving diet or posture. But because it eventually falls off with age, pro players that stay around CS2 or VALORANT for a long time need to rely on more than just reaction time.</p>



<p>Do you have below or above average reaction times? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Among other things, it's rumored that the new season will take a page out of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-og-map-changes-in-season-2/2900-6184/" data-ref-id="2900-6184">Fortnite's playbook</a> and be an "OG" season that calls back to the game's origins, including bringing back the original Warzone map, Verdansk.</p><p>Boosting player numbers to 150 for Warzone could also be a reflection of this OG status, as the game originally had 150-player matches at launch in 2020.</p>

It has the Multi-Team Domination and Multi-Team Hotzone game modes, which act similar to traditional King of the Hill game modes. In Domination, there are four zones to conquer, while in Hotzone, there is on large one.</p><p>There are also two new game modes: Splitball and Firecracker. The former is Splitgate 2's take on the classic Capture the Flag mode while the latter is a variation of the Search and Destroy mode.</p><p>Aside from Glacier, the two other new maps are Bypass and Eden. Bypass is a vertically designed map based on a park and Eden is filled with portal walls for players to utilize.</p><p>There have also been changes to two game modes based on previous player feedback. In Team Deathmatch, rounds are extended and the kill target has been raised. In regular Hotzone, the shared progression on captures has been removed.</p><p>Splitgate 2 is a shooter inspired by Halo and Portal, with its portal-centric gameplay allowing players to transport themselves through portals making Splitgate stand out amongst its contemporaries. Be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-check-out-the-massive-new-glacier-map-in-this-exclusive-video/1100-6529713/" data-ref-id="1100-6529713">exclusive video of Multi-Team Domination on the Glacier map</a>. While the open alpha is only available on PC and current-gen consoles, the game will also come to PS4 and Xbox One sometime this year.</p>

		<p>Blades of Fire has been revealed by 505 Games and developer MercurySteam, their upcoming third person action RPG that will be launching surprisingly soon for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 22nd May 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Official Announcement Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFDarIpwXsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of smithing to be expected as you forge new weaponry to go up against a menagerie of enemies that include everything from imposingly armoured warriors, to many-handed freaks, and the more natural and mechanical.</p>
<p>There’s shades of the modern God of War to this, from the closeness of the third person camera, and it will be interesting to see how this has come together.</p>

<p>Spanish developer MercurySteam is best known in recent times for their excellent Metroid Dread, the culmination of over a decade working on a string of Castlevania games for Konami in the early 2010s, before being entrusted with a Metroid II: Samus Returns remake for 3DS.</p>
<p>Sure, Blades of Fire is going to be in a rather different genre, but looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread review</a>, I bestowed the 2D platforming sequel a fantastic 9/10, concluding:</p>
<p>“Metroid Dread sees the galaxy’s best bounty hunter return in fine form. It takes the terror of being hunted from Metroid Fusion, the more modern direction of Samus Returns, and the freedom to add to the series’ decades of lore to create something that’s nigh on essential for Metroid fans.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now.1120992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-572-60-fix-black-screen-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a new GeForce Game Ready driver</a> optimized for the latest NARAKA: BLADEPOINT update. The highly popular melee focused free-to-play Battle Royale game by 24 Entertainment now supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, allowing players to achieve astounding frame rates on the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>
<p>Leading the pack is the flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. According to NVIDIA benchmarks, it can run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at an average of nearly 600 frames per second (yes, you've read that right) at 4K resolution and maximum graphics settings with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. That's a massive uplift compared to the admittedly still more than sufficient 150 frames per second that the card can achieve without DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The GeForce RTX 5080 achieves only a little more than half the average frame rate of its bigger sibling, 312 frames per second. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is fairly close at 255 average frames per second. At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen lets GeForce RTX 50 owners run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at even more mind-boggling frame rates: 737, 536, and 450 FPS at 1440P and 933, 727, and 642 FPS at 1080P.</p>
<p>The latest game update also optimizes character grappling hook resources to provide a smoother experience when using it. In-game 'loot memory' was also optimized, improving memory recovery after combat to reduce memory consumption. Content-wise, 24 Entertainment added a new hero called Ziping Yin to the Showdown mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgrJieiIZg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA also revealed that the new DLSS 4 plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to game developers, allowing them to access the latest and greatest transformer models for optimal image quality.</p>
<p>As a roundup of the latest PC game releases with integrated DLSS technologies, the racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is out with support for Frame Generation and Super Resolution, while the roguelite first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287150/Revenge_of_the_Mage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenge of the Mage</a> launched last month in early access with Super Resolution support.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will debut with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and ray-traced reflections; on the same day, PGA TOUR 2K25 will be released with DLSS Super Resolution.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-pushes-ahead-with-ai-in-gaming.1120989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft might say its top priority right now is security, but it’s been clear for months that AI is just as important. The odd division out has been Xbox, which hasn’t discussed its use of AI much in public. But that changed last week when Microsoft ripped the band-aid off and waded, somewhat clumsily, into the debate over AI in gaming.</p><p>Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">Muse</a>, its new AI model that can generate gameplay. It was trained on Ninja Theory’s Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, and it can understand a 3D world and physics and then respond to players’ interactions. While Muse is a Microsoft Research project at heart, Microsoft presented it in a way that linked it directly to Xbox and the future of the company’s gaming efforts. That has divided opinion between those who argue that Microsoft will use this model to build games and lay off developers, and others who think this is still very early and simply another tool in a game developer’s kit.</p><p>I’ve been speaking to game developers over the past week to get a better understanding of the response to Muse. Of the handful I’ve spoken to, no one is willing to speak on the record for reasons like career concerns and the potential impact speaking out might have on game deals with Xbox. Most echo what <strong>David Goldfarb</strong>, developer and founder of The Outsiders, <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1892273449784967438">posted on X</a> last week, “Fuck this shit.”</p><p>Goldfarb expanded on that brief response in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/">interview with <em>Wired</em></a>. “When we rely on this stuff we are implicitly empowering a class of people who own these tools and don’t give a fuck about how they reshape our lives,” he said.</p><p>That’s a concern I’ve heard from multiple game developers: if they accept these AI tools then what happens next? There’s a growing fear in the game industry right now that AI will replace human creators, and it’s not a baseless fear, either. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them. In an industry that’s already struggling with costs and layoffs, the anxiety over AI replacing jobs is high.</p><p>Some developers are hoping that models like Muse will be limited to the early stages of game development, where you could use an AI model to create some rough gameplay instead of sketching out ideas and concepts. Given how nascent Muse is, that seems like a reasonable assumption right now, but as models get more capable over time, where do the lines blur?</p><p>Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> described Muse as a “massive moment of wow” in a recent <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella">podcast</a>. “We’re going to have a catalog of games soon that we will start using these models, or we’re going to train these models to generate, and then start playing them,” he said.</p><p>Microsoft is getting ready to release at least one AI-generated game on Copilot Labs, the company’s test bed for AI that requires a monthly $20 subscription to Copilot Pro. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s AI research work tell me the company has also been experimenting with several minigames that are best described as AI-infused. The games, developed by Microsoft Research, use generative models and both human writers and reviewers to create stories and illustrations. One of the minigames, <em>Rushes</em>, lets players select storylines and make choices that influence the AI-driven narrative.</p><p>I’m not expecting Microsoft to release these minigames, as they’re designed as research projects on how AI models and humans interact in game design, but the company could always highlight them in the future. Microsoft chose to demonstrate its Muse model running in real time during an employee-only town hall earlier this week, instead of these minigames. </p><p>The work between Microsoft Research and Xbox on minigames and models like Muse are just the beginning of Microsoft’s AI in gaming efforts. At GDC next month, Microsoft is planning to highlight more ways it’s using AI in gaming. In one session, <strong>Fatima Kardar</strong>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft, <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-future-of-gaming-supported-by-ai-how-xbox-is-empowering-players-and-creators-presented-by-microsoft/911783">will discuss</a> “how Xbox is using AI to unlock new opportunities across the Xbox ecosystem for both players and game creators.” Another session <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ai-innovation-for-game-experiences-from-research-to-prototyping-presented-by-microsoft/911349">will demonstrate</a> how game developers and researchers at Microsoft are experimenting with new AI tools for gaming.</p><p>While many of Microsoft’s AI sessions at GDC will be future-looking, there are a couple from Blizzard that will detail how <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/machine-learning-summit-fitting-armor-assets-in-world-of-warcraft-with-deep-learning/908208">use AI models</a> to automate 3D armor fitting or how developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/amplifying-player-voices-with-llms-in-game-development/907458">parse through player feedback</a> using large language models. These show off the potential for AI tools to assist developers rather than replace them, so they’re likely to be far less controversial than an AI model that generates gameplay.</p><p>Microsoft says it’s now leaving it up to its own game studios to decide on how AI is used across their games. “We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” said Ninja Theory studio head <strong>Dom Matthews</strong>, in a video accompanying Microsoft’s Muse announcement last week. Just days later though, Microsoft-owned Activision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618822/activision-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ai-generated-content">forced to confirm</a> that <em>Call of Duty </em>uses AI-generated content. The confirmation came months after fans noticed a zombie Santa with six fingers in a loading screen in <em>Black Ops 6</em> over the holidays, alongside weapon decals and player cards that seemed to be AI generated.</p><p>How Microsoft’s other Xbox game studios react to its push for AI in gaming is going to be something to keep an eye on throughout 2025, especially when developers outside of Xbox have <a href="https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-director-criticizes-ai/">loudly criticized</a> AI use in game development, with one indie developer creating a <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal">“No Gen AI” seal</a> that developers can use on their game’s store page. There might be growing pushback against AI in gaming from developers and players, but I don’t think it will be long until other Xbox game studios make the decision to use AI tools or AI-generated content. By unveiling Muse last week, Microsoft has made clear it wants its studios to be at the very forefront of AI in gaming, regardless of the pushback.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is testing free Office for Windows apps with ads. </strong>Surprisingly, Microsoft has quietly started allowing some countries to install a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618278/microsoft-office-free-windows-apps-ad-supported-version">free version of Office for Windows that includes ads</a>. Microsoft has confirmed it’s just a test for now, but it’s a pretty big test to overhaul how Office is distributed in certain countries. The ad-supported version of Office includes banners that are permanently visible at the side, as well as 15-second video ads that play every few hours. Given this appears to be largely limited to India, I suspect Microsoft is looking at ways it can tempt people into paying for Office instead of pirating it. Microsoft’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/microsoft-tests-show-91-new-pcs-from-india-loaded-with-pirated-software/articleshow/66475487.cms?from=mdr">own tests in 2018</a> showed that 91 percent of new PCs in India came loaded with pirated software.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft launches next-gen Phi AI models</strong>. While we await OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 model, Microsoft made a smaller AI model announcement of its own this week. Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini are <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/aiplatformblog/introducing-phi-4-microsoft%E2%80%99s-newest-small-language-model-specializing-in-comple/4357090">Microsoft’s latest small language models</a>, and both are now available on Azure AI Foundry and Hugging Face. Both can be used by developers on smartphones, PCs, and cars, and Phi-4-multimodal improves speech recognition, translation, summarization, audio understanding, and image analysis.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox’s new <em>Fable</em> game is delayed to 2026. </strong>Rumors have been circulating that <em>Fable </em>might not make its 2025 release window, and Microsoft confirmed this week that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">being pushed to 2026</a>. Given how busy 2025 is looking for Xbox games, I’m not surprised <em>Fable</em> has been given more time here. The question now is whether Microsoft is still targeting a 2025 release for <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, like I’d heard last year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft makes Copilot Voice and Think Deeper free with unlimited use. </strong>Microsoft made OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model free for all Copilot users last month, and now it’s providing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619199/microsoft-copilot-free-unlimited-voice-think-deeper-open-ai-o1-reasoning-model-ai">unlimited use of this model and Copilot’s voice capabilities</a> to everyone this week. I think we’re going to see a lot more Copilot announcements in the coming months, and I’ve heard multiple times from sources recently that Microsoft is very focused on increasing AI usage by reducing the barriers to entry and the costs involved.</span></li><li><span><strong>You’ll need more Microsoft Rewards points to pay for Game Pass soon</strong>. Microsoft is bumping the amount of points it takes to get Game Pass through its Rewards program. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/02/microsoft-rewards-appears-to-be-increasing-its-prices-for-xbox-game-pass">It now costs</a> level two members 17,000 (previously 12,000) points for a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, with PC Game Pass jumping to 10,500 points (previously, 7,500).</span></li><li><span><strong>Scientists question Microsoft’s claims of a quantum computing breakthrough</strong>. Microsoft was quick to claim it had reached a milestone breakthrough in quantum computing last week, unveiling its Majorana 1 chip. Now, the physics community <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/617792/microsofts-quantum-quandary">has a lot of questions</a> about Microsoft’s paper, which the company is promising to address at the APS meeting in March.</span></li><li><span><strong>Indiana Jones now has DLSS 4 support</strong>. Bethesda updated <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> with DLSS 4, Multi Frame Generation, and even FSR 3.1 Frame Gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616975/indiana-jones-dlss-4-fsr-frame-gen-support">support last week</a>. That’s great news for PC players, and we’re now waiting to hear if <em>Indiana Jones </em>is going to make Microsoft’s target of an April release on PS5.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft completes EU sovereign cloud project</strong>. Microsoft has finalized its multiyear project to allow its European commercial and public sector customers to store and process their data within European Union countries. “This milestone is the culmination of a massive, multiyear engineering effort across hundreds of Microsoft product teams and thousands of developers around the globe,” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/26/microsoft-completes-landmark-eu-data-boundary-offering-enhanced-data-residency-and-transparency/">says Microsoft</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft pauses the rollout of its redesigned Windows 11 battery indicator</strong>. Microsoft started rolling out an improved battery indicator to Windows 11 PCs last week, hitting the Release Preview ring before a broader rollout. Just days later, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3321-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Microsoft paused it</a> “to address some issues.” It’s not clear exactly what those issues are, but Microsoft says it plans to “begin rolling it out in a future update soon.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft has reportedly dropped some AI data center leases</strong>. Microsoft has committed to spending $80 billion this fiscal year on AI data centers, but there are signs it might be wavering on that commitment. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/microsoft-cancels-leases-for-ai-data-centers-analyst-says"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a> that US brokerage TD Cowen warned that Microsoft has pulled back on some leases for US data center capacity. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report directly, and one analyst has suggested this could be just “business as usual” with Microsoft free to “move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft calls on the Trump administration to ‘avoid a strategic misstep in the AI global race.’ </strong>Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/27/trump-administration-ai-global-race/">penned an open letter</a> to the Trump administration, asking it to change the Biden administration’s interim AI diffusion rule that caps the export of US AI components. Smith argues that the rule will “give China a strategic advantage” in the AI race, and could prevent US allies and partners from accessing AI infrastructure and services from Microsoft and other US tech companies.</span></li></ul></div><p>What do you think about Microsoft’s big push for AI in gaming?

            <p>EA have restored and released the full source code for several antique Command &amp; Conquer games under the GPL license, in a red letter day for series modders. The games in question are the original Command &amp; Conquer (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-red-alert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-generals">Command &amp; Conquer Generals</a>, plus the latter's Zero Hour expansion. That's a lot of refurbishable strategy game to get your head around.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this is reportedly the result of EA commissioning one particular modder, community figure Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, to restore the old C&amp;C source codes, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/1izmml4/cc_steam_workshop_support_source_code/">described at fearful length on Reddit</a>. If you're not familiar with him, he was involved in bringing the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection to Steam back in March 2024. RPS Tank Driver-For-Hire Steve Hogarty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/command-conquer-remastered-collection-review">called that</a> "the treatment these genre-defining games deserve".</p>
<p>You can find the source code for Tiberian Dawn <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn">on this Github page</a>. The Red Alert code is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert">over here</a>, while Renegade is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Renegade">here</a>, and Generals/Zero Hour is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour">thisaway</a>.</p>
<p>They're also throwing custom mapmakers a bag of bones by adding Steam Workshop support for Renegade, Generals, and Zero Hour, together with Command &amp; Conquer Tiberium Wars, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3 - plus the Uprising expansion - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-4">Command &amp; Conquer 4</a> Tiberian Twilight. All of the mission editor and world builder tools for these games have been updated so you can publish maps directly to the Workshop.</p>
<p>"When you subscribe to an item on the Steam Workshop (via the Client or webpage), the games will now pull that content down when you next launch the game and the maps will be displayed in the singleplayer/multiplayer map selection menus," explains Feenan in the Reddit post.</p>
<p>Finally, EA have released a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Modding_Support">C&amp;C Modding Support pack</a>, containing the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use original series developer Westwood's old SAGE engine.</p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> finally so close you can almost smell it (sweat, damp cat, and a lingering whiff of dung bomb, would be my guess), Capcom has teased more of what's coming in its first post-launch content update, now confirmed to be launching in "early April".
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Capcom has discussed Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1, of course; earlier this month, it revealed everyone's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune would be the first post-launch monster joining Wilds. But now, on the eve of the game's release, it's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236">additionally teased a "new level of challenge"</a>, that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game.
</p>
<p>
Its announcement also alluded to "another challenging monster", but it's unclear if this is a reference to Mizutsune or a third new monster. Either way - as I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">noted in my review this week</a> - Wilds' difficulty feels like it skews a little low at the moment, even where Tempered monsters are involved, so it'll be nice get something a little tougher to tackle so early into its lifespan.

<p>
And there's more. Capcom has <em>also</em> teased a "new place to gather" for hunters who've completed the main story, providing somewhere for friends to "meet, communicate, have meals together, and more". And by more, I assume it means arm wrestle. Currently, Wilds doesn't have a centralised gathering hub in the same way previous Monster Hunters games did, so the addition should create a welcome social focal point for players. And hopefully we'll get some seasonal decor to admire once the post-launch quests start rolling in.
</p>
<p>
But before Title Update 1's "early April" release, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-monster-hunter-wilds-physical-release-requires-a-day-one-update-but-digital-buyers-can-get-a-head-start">set to receive a 15GB day one update</a> - although Capcom hasn't yet detailed what it'll include. Hopefully, it'll address the technical rough spots evident in the pre-launch version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-feels-undercooked-on-ps5-series-x-and-especially-series-s">Digital Foundry called "undercooked" on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-plays-better-on-ps5-pro">the PS5 Pro version fares better</a>.
