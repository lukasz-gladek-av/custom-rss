            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fields-of-mistria-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NPC Studio has released the first&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>roadmap, showing off what you can expect from the nostalgic pixel-art life sim as it undergoes its Early Access journey.</p>
<p><em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>was only released in Early Access yesterday, but in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2142790/view/4373643059887209361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>, developer NPC Studio shows it's not resting on its laurels and that there's plenty of content coming to the farming sim in the future.</p>
<p>There's already around 35-40 hours to enjoy in the game, according to NPC Studio, but&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>'s first update is already scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024, although its exact date has yet to be determined.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=nyKCyOox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=ghNzTe4X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>update is due to arrive later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's first update will raise the NPC heart progression cap and add new NPC dialogue, and it'll also bring new enemies and cosmetic loot for the monsters in the mines and dungeon.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new renown rewards and board requests in town, as well as a raised skill cap level, new perks, and new upgrades for your home, plus more. All of that is coming to the game in its first update.</p>
<p>In the future, NPC Studio says it wants to further raise the heart cap and add new events for romanceable NPCs, and that new mine and dungeon biomes, perks, and home upgrades are also on the way later down the line.</p>
<p>As if all of that wasn't enough, you'll also be able to ride large animals and keep pets, so if you're an animal lover, just hold on a little longer and all of your dreams could potentially come true.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>, it's a bright, nostalgic pixel art-based life and farming sim with an anime-inspired aesthetic. It's a deliberate homage to the farming sim-style RPGs of the 90s and beyond, so expect shades of&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, and more.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-brings-wacky-fun-to-battle-royale-and-more.945900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the chaotic jellybeans into the battle royale game's world via a brand new obstacle course and the chance to make&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed maps in Creative mode.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Where We Fallin' event sees a new&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed obstacle course appearing in the skies over the game's map. To access it, you'll have to find a golden Bean Idol, several of which are "hidden" in the Classy Courts area.</p>
<p>Once you've found one, you'll be transported to the&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacle course. Completing it in time will give you the chance to earn Locker items like a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>jellybean plushie. Awww.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=XUPZOPT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=lAxXFqGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could have one of these for your very own.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, it wouldn't be much of an obstacle course if your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character didn't morph into a cute little jellybean, and certain outfits, like Brite Bomber and Jonesy the Secondst, will even have their own custom jellybeans. Sadly, if you're not an original&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you'll just be a default bean.</p>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, you can now also <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create and publish</a> your very own&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed islands in Creative mode and UEFN using "a massive selection of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacles and props".</p>
<p>To kickstart your creativity,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developer Mediatonic has made three of its own maps, which you can play with the following codes.</p>
<ul><li>Falling Up: 4185-8103-4745</li>
<li>Tumble Towers: 1985-3300-5865</li>
<li>Blunderdome Blast: 7671-9041-8194</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, three extra&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed stages have been created by Mediatonic in conjunction with Studio 568 and Spiral House, and the codes for those are as follows.</p>
<ul><li>Hex-A-Gone Unlimited: 2214-7960-2047</li>
<li>Bean Circuit: 0057-3389-4313</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup: 7485-7322-4774</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>' appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>makes a certain degree of sense considering that Mediatonic was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-developer-mediatonic-acquired-by-epic-games">acquired by Epic Games back in 2021</a>, but it's far from the only crossover to be featured in the phenomenally popular battle royale game.</p>
<p>Other properties to have made the jump include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024"><em>Star Wars</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-fortnite-my-hero-academia-crossover"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover"><em>Futurama</em></a>, plus many, many more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s penchant for crossovers is also arguably the reason for the existence of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early"><em>Minecraft</em>-style survival-crafting experience</a>&nbsp;that recently <a href="https://x.com/LEGOFortnite/status/1820763375757893718" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got an update adding fast travel</a>&nbsp;to its massive blocky world.</p>

            <p>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a> is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Simply put, you’ll be able to create a custom "Landless Adventurer" character at the start of a campaign, just like designing a normal ruler (you might also find yourself landless mid-game following some classic political turmoil). At this point, you'll be expected to play the game a little differently than normal. </p>
<p>"Crusader Kings is a game about marriage, inheritance, and complex realm politics; none of which really apply to wandering characters with nary a vassal to call their own," say Paradox in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-151-landless-adventurers-part-i.1697815/">a lengthy developer diary</a>. "Well, simply put, we think of [adventurers] as the ultimate underdogs: outsiders with no land or prospects, but also no responsibilities or restrictions...</p>
<p>"We wanted to reflect this philosophy with a play style focused on travel and roaming, encouraging you to experience the map in a different way by moving across and spectating it — occasionally stopping to influence this realm or that when you have to proverbially sing for your supper."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That travel takes the form of making camp. You pick a region and set up camp there, at which point you'll be offered "contracts" - various odd jobs that range in difficulty and payout. Some contracts will see you help out in a war (provided you have the soldiers trailing along with you). Others might have you assisting the local ruler's councillors in some scheme or plot, or collecting taxes from reluctant locals, or educating a noble's child. </p>
<p>"Some require no travel, some require you to travel the length of the map, while others might involve a small tour of a character’s realm," say the developers. "Naturally, a core part of this is servicing the fantasy of forming a strong, mobile mercenary army, but we also didn’t want players to be restricted to just this. For every Roger de Flor, there’s an Ibn Battuta or a Marco Polo, after all."</p>
<p>Having read Ibn Battuta's travels, I love this idea. I, too, want to upset a despotic Sultan in India. I, too, wish to be mugged on the road an inconceivable number of times. (The developers say that the "travel safety mechanics" will be the same as those introduced in previous expansion Tours &amp; Tournaments.) To generate new contracts, you'll have to stay on the move, hopping from one de jure region to another in search of the next gig. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"If you complete a contract to your employer’s satisfaction, you’ll receive resources like gold, prestige, sometimes piety, and the new Adventurer-specific provisions... Prestige is needed to advance your fame, which both governs the tier of rulers who’ll offer you contracts (kings and emperors won’t hand them out to just anybody)."</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it feels a lot like the mercenary wandering of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade</a> games, throwing your lot in with a distant duke before upping sticks to go charm the neighbouring Khan's daughter. Just like those games, you'll also need to keep a healthy stack of food and supplies (those "provisions" mentioned above). If you start running low, followers will start to lose their opinion of you, and starvation will eventually kick in. But it may not come to that. You may become a prestigious wanderer, prompting the chance to earn yourself a landed title.</p>
<p>"Landing yourself should be possible (especially if you’re willing to take the indignity of an impoverished, remote county somewhere), but not something you can do with a click of your fingers and no prep work," say the devs.</p>
<p>"We do expect some players to want to be adventurers for as little time as possible, and others to want to be them for centuries at a time. Off-ramps are provided at various stages for players who decide they want to leave the life of an Adventurer. It’s up to you if you’d be happy taking a back-water county somewhere in exchange for a huge sum of cash, building an army to try retaking your throne, or simply drift around the world making your mark in a half a dozen small ways."</p>
<p>The post shares an example of exactly that, detailing a playthrough featuring a landless Kashmiri schemer called Shirin who "longs to explore far from home". It's worth a read if you still want finer details of how certain contract types will play out (a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDl-F0OYOP8">video version is also available</a>). At one point, she takes a transport contract, meaning to escort a Baron westwards, only to discover that Persia is in the midst of the Iranian Intermezzo, a huge and prolonged struggle that probably will not clear up by tomorrow. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-3.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Along the way," the dev explains, "danger events bedevil us, [my follower] Lalit manages to lose some provisions and get beaten up in a tavern fight, and I caught typhus."</p>
<p>Yes. YES. This is exactly the kind of stuff I long for in a CKIII game. Travel! Excitement! Accidentally dropping all your food into a puddle of excrement at the side of the road! </p>
<p>There are a bunch of other contract types, including ones based on intrigue and stewardship. But there are also jobs allowing for criminal actions like arson, murder or robbery, essentially making you a travelling bandit. At some point you'll be able to "wipe the slate" clean with a donation of gold and prestige, should you want to clean up and go straight again.</p>
<p>There are a lot more differences in playstyle when compared to a landed noble. Skill trees will be different, for example, and the grandiose feasts and weddings of the gentry are replaced with campfire revelries. You'll also have to invest in camp upgrades, in order to unlock other traditionally available features. Like creating a portable shrine to allow for converting religions. And, perhaps most importantly, succession becomes far more "informal" and simple: your oldest child or closest relative will take the lead. Failing that, whatever follower in the camp has the highest "prowess". </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Adventurers don’t really experience succession politics in the same way that even the smallest realm does," the developer explains. "There are no laws binding them save their own will, and comparatively little to be divided or fought over anyway..." </p>
<p>The post goes deeper into the mechanics and says more details will be covered in a later dev diary. Considering the length of this post alone, I'm excitedly afraid of what constitutes the "individual nuts and bolts" yet to be discussed. But that's Crusader Kings' simulation for you. Why be merely complex, when you can be a ferociously intricate labyrinth of tiny cogs?</p>
<p>All in all, it's getting me excited for CKIII in a way I haven't been for a while. And it's not even the flagship feature of the Roads To Power DLC (that's all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Byzantine stuff</a>). Adventurers previously existed in CKII, but mostly as pesky randos who would show up in your country with an army and a shit-eating grin. Here, players will actually be let loose into the chaos of CKIII's fully simulated nonsense, without any of the trappings of the nobility. I hope it'll be as disastrously good as it looks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developer RageSquid has unveiled Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to  2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, which is aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need" when it comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> and Game Pass sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The original Descenders was all about exhilarating mountain biking across a procedurally generated world. Descenders Next, though, is doing something a little bit different, expanding its scope to include as many extreme sports as it possibly can over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
As per its reveal announcement, RageSquid's goal with Descenders Next is to capture the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across numerous disciplines, beginning with boarding sports on release.

<p>
"Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding action," the studio explains, "before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of Next."
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across procedural off-piste mountains chaining into "tight, winding parks and vistas", where players can attempt speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, even scavenger hunts. There's talk of "multiple huge biomes", as well as full multiplayer support, and players can earn rep used to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more as they play. RageSquid even promises a "banging" soundtrack form Monstercat.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Descenders Next's release in 2025, RageSquid will be running a number of online Test Sessions later this year, and interested parties can sign up via the game's website.

These games didn’t concern themselves with Italian plumbers or sad surrogate dads, but with fierce warriors who shirtlessly strode into battle, their muscles on glorious display, to cut down their foes with swords and prove themselves the strongest and manliest of all. I speak, of course, of barbarians. And though, in recent decades, games focused entirely on the heroic exploits of barbarians have been few and far between, we now find ourselves in the midst of a mini-renaissance of barbarian games! To quote the 1982 film <em>Conan the Barbarian</em>, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos?si=ct8qc-L71YoFr2vb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/Oo9buo9Mtos?si=ct8qc-L71YoFr2vb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That is good.

Of course, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/I5b33nTn2v8?si=ikm63PBLon25Ap7C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/I5b33nTn2v8?si=ikm63PBLon25Ap7C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there’s <em>Barbarian </em>for the Amiga</a></span>, an awkward platformer that is still awesome because your sprite is a shirtless, muscular warrior wielding a huge sword. Then, of course, there’s <em>Barbarian </em>for the Amiga, a fighting game that made a friend and I laugh endlessly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we cut each other’s heads off again and again</a></span>. (Here in the U.S. this one was called <em>Death Sword </em>but it will always be <em>Barbarian </em>to me.) If I list every barbarian game of the era, I’ll be here all day, but other notable ones include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sword of Sodan</em></a></span><em> </em>(avoid the Genesis version at all costs) and perhaps the most legendary of them all, <em>Rastan</em>, Taito’s tough-as-nails 1987 arcade game with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and a barbarian hero to rival the likes of Conan himself. Behold it here in all its glory.<br></p><p><br>In addition to being arguably the most famous barbarian game of the 1980s, <em>Rastan </em>is also the one whose influence on the two brand-new barbarian games that are giving the genre a mini-renaissance is most clear. First of all, there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Abathor</em></a></span>, a side-scrolling action game available on every current platform. <em>Abathor </em>lets you and up to three friends embark on an epic hack-and-slash quest across dozens of stages, and while at first things may feel a bit easy and ordinary, rest assured that as you progress, the intensity ratchets up mightily. Thus far I’ve made it to the game’s fourth zone, and I’m really impressed by how it’s now starting to throw constant surprises at me, all manner of new perils and new situations that are keeping me on my toes. If anything, I’d urge you NOT to watch the trailer below, because I think it’s better to discover what the game has to offer yourself. However, if you want a peek at the game’s gorgeous pixel art and old-school gameplay, look no further. <em>Abathor </em>is definitely a worthy successor to the barbarian games of old.<br></p><p>And then there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Volgarr the Viking II</em></a></span>. Now look, <em>Abathor </em>ain’t exactly a walk in the park, but <em>Volgarr II</em>, like its 2013 predecessor, leans into the difficulty of the 1980s games that inspired it—<em>hard</em>. Volgarr may be a muscular viking warrior but he still dies in one hit by default, and playing it, you <em>will </em>die, <em>a lot. </em>This is the kind of game that demands that you study, memorize, and master it, remembering where enemies spawn and how they behave so that you know how to tackle them and ultimately emerge from the level triumphant. Maybe that sounds like a chore to you, but let me tell you, my time with <em>Volgarr II </em>has reminded me just how immensely rewarding games with this kind of difficulty can be.<br></p><p>I can see myself in real-time figuring out how to navigate the challenges it puts before me, and developing that kind of mastery is immensely satisfying. Also, if you played the original ten years ago and decided it wasn’t for you, don’t write off this sequel just yet. In every way that counts, it’s just as challenging as its predecessor, but it also gives you a few more tools that just might give you the encouragement and support you need to succeed—things like mid-level checkpoints and one helpful feature I refuse to spoil, it’s so twisted and inventive. I still have a long way to go in <em>Volgarr II</em>, but I know it offers the kind of satisfaction I’ve rarely experienced from a game since the likes of <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>and <em>Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts </em>were commonplace. Like <em>Abathor</em>, you can now find <em>Volgarr II </em>on pretty much every platform that still gets new video games.<br></p><p>Okay, so two games may not seem like a lot, but for a subgenre that has seen so little activity in so long—specifically tough, side-scrolling hack-and-slash action games about barbarians—two great entries landing at right around the same time feels like a veritable feast of riches. For people like me who’ve been longing for a return to the glory days of <em>Rastan</em>, feast well, my friends. Valhalla awaits. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-good-reason-to-buy-a-yeti-mic.945858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dont-buy-a-yeti-mic-please-logitech<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Podcasters have it so good today. Back in the day, you had basically one choice for “what kind of mic should I use?” if you were a normal person, and that was the Blue Yeti mic. You may have one of these in your home. It served people decently, but we have moved on as a society. Yet I still see Blue Yetis being sold in 2024, the brand having been folded into Logitech. I have had to deal with these things for years and years, and have developed a list of things I hate about them.&nbsp;</p><h4>1. I hate its awful little USB port</h4><figure><figcaption>This is taken directly from an iFixit guide for the Yeti, which you may need if this awful little USB port breaks. Credit: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Blue+Yeti+Disassembly/111262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Jones/iFixit</a></figcaption></figure><p>I never want to see a Mini or Micro USB port or cable for the rest of my life. After a long and tumultuous era, we have settled on which USB plugs and ports suck the least, and they’re Standard-A, Type-C, and occasionally the chunky big Standard-B ones if you have a printer or something. The port on the bottom of the Blue Yeti is a very bad Mini B port. Due to the position of the mic and the generally poor quality control of the device, that thing will constantly break or just slowly get shitty over time. If you work in media, this means you have two or three broken Blue Yetis in a box in a closet next to several old capture boxes that suffered a similar fate.&nbsp;</p><p>I know Blue Yetis are still like this because my coworker Riley bought one fairly recently without asking me, brought it home, and the port on it instantly died. This made me so upset that I needed to write a manifesto about this fucking microphone.</p><h4>2.&nbsp; I hate the three little capsules inside it, the different pickup patterns, and how it is designed</h4><figure><figcaption>Instead of 3 very cheap capsules, they should have put one good one in there. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>One of the ways that the Blue Yeti was novel when it came out is that it has multiple capsules in it. This allows you to switch the pickup pattern (the direction the microphone is sensitive) in four different ways: omnidirectional, cardioid, bidirectional and stereo. This is a feature that <a href="https://www.akg.com/microphones/condenser-microphones/C414XLS.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exists in better mics</a>, and while those were theoretically useful if you have multiple people talking in the same room, practically speaking cardioid (so called because it’s a heart shape) is the only one you want to use because you should not be using one Blue Yeti for multiple people unless you want your podcast producer to be mad at you. Those three internal modules are <a href="https://youtu.be/EqzE3QOJwBw?si=GQbwbF3vSqutvTr3&amp;t=234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not well placed directionally</a>, and instead of focusing on three mediocre capsules, they could have put one pretty good one in there.</p><figure><figcaption>I have had to send this illustration that Blue made to multiple people over the years. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>The real problem with the Blue Yeti is who it was for, and how the weird design backfires on its intended audience. This is particularly painful if you have to clean up after the results. The Yeti is a mic that your coworker or someone who is not tech-savvy would use in case they had to be on a voice call or record a podcast from home. They Google “best USB mic,” buy it, and use it without looking at the instructions. Oftentimes they select the wrong pickup pattern, speak into the wrong side, or don’t realize that it’s a front firing mic instead of a top-firing one. This is a very common mistake to make given the general shape of the mic.</p><p>If you’re an audio producer or in video production, you get the files they recorded in Audacity and it sounds like the user is in a different room. It would be clear that the well-meaning user set it up incorrectly, and you would be tasked with “fixing it,” to which you would reply that “that’s not how audio works, but I’ll see what I can do.” What’s more, most people would not use a mic arm or mic stand and simply stick with the big heavy default one, but realistically that means the speaker would often be hunched over or way too far away. This also leads to the aforementioned cable flexing, which can cause the USB port to deteriorate.&nbsp;</p><p>If used correctly, you can get somewhat passable audio from the Blue Yeti compared to internal laptop mics, but it’s a mic whose primary audience is novices who do not know how to use a mic correctly. The weird, additional points of failure would ultimately lead to many very bad sounding podcasts and broken hardware from people trying their best, and lead to the frustration of many audio professionals trying to salvage their <em>Buffy</em> recap podcast.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="2021 Yule Log, the Blue Yeti" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdETO7u-y7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>If you would like to see a Blue Yeti slowly being roasted over a fire, here you go.</figcaption></figure></div><h4>3. There are better mics, and mic/interface combos, for the same price</h4><figure><figcaption>The money spent on a Yeti mic could be spent on so many other, better options. Credit: Røde, Shure, Zoom, Motu</figcaption></figure><p>For years people would go into a store or to The Wirecutter, see the Blue Yeti, and think “Well that’s the one that people recommended, so it must be good!” Times have changed, and mics have gotten way better. Though the former top pick of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-usb-microphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, they no longer will recommend it and accurately describe it for what it is: middling. <a href="https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/audio/best-usb-microphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Gear Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-usb-microphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom’s Guide</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-usb-microphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired </a>still recommend the Yeti, which is probably the most I have ever disagreed with any of those websites. Better mics exist now at that price point ($129.99 but often on sale for $99). You can also spend a bit more or get a used mic on eBay from someone who used to have a podcast but whose dreams are now broken.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MOTU M2 USB-C Audio Interface - REVIEW and Measurements!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3ednXYd1pA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The Motu came out 4 years ago and it's still great. It just works. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=rode+podmic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Røde’s PodMic</a> is fantastic in both its XLR and USB variants, although the USB version is not at the same price point. Audio Technica has some USB mics that, while not the best, are far better in any head-on comparison. The <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/wave-3-black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato Wave:3</a> wowed our now <a href="https://kotaku.com/elgato-s-making-damn-fine-streaming-mics-now-1844082525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed coworker Mike Fahey</a>, particularly for its intuitive Wave Link software. On top of that, the money you spend on a bad USB mic that could easily break can be better spent on a good audio interface and a cheap but durable dynamic mic. If you wanna get serious (which some people might not!), an interface offers more flexibility and better sound.</p><p>If you are digging into interfaces, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JulianKrause" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian Krause</a> is hands-down the best reviewer on YouTube for up-to-date reviews. Personally I loved the <a href="https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motu M2</a> when I used it. It has a beautiful screen, a solid body, a loopback, killer latency, beautiful sounding preamps, and <em>it just works</em>. I have heard that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXc-EIL9RXI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4th generation Focusrite interfaces</a> have gotten much better than their predecessors, which is good because I severely disliked the Gen 1 and 2 Focusrites, which I found to be buggy with weak preamps that would require additional hardware (the common recommendation for ages was “get a Focusrite and a <a href="https://www.cloudmicrophones.com/cloudlifter-cl-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloudlifter</a>,” which I never agreed with). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-x3A8Wfg8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom’s AMS interfaces</a> are perfectly fine, teensy and about $80 bucks for the solo if you need something small and aren’t picky about preamp noise. In fact, the audible difference between a lot of interfaces is getting smaller and smaller, and you can do well with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRdtypSOC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly cheap ones</a>, even ones that cost $50.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO choose an Audio Interface – The Ultimate Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_L86wNbzi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A good overview of the pros and cons of various Audio Interfaces. If you just want a USB mic that works, just get one of those instead!</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to USB mics, there are also countless cheap <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM5AgwWimEE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic </a>microphones like the Shure <a href="https://x.com/angelbbgrrl420/status/1815243745253867539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SM57s</a> and SM58s in circulation (to say nothing of clones). Those two have been around since the 1960s. You have definitely seen one on stage, and they will probably still work after being run over by a big rig. A lot of streamers get very fancy with dynamic mics (the SM7B and Electrovoice RE20 are gold standards, but I am partial to the Heil PR-40), but most people won’t have to go over $99 with an interface. Beyond a certain point with audio, it’s diminishing returns for most people.</p><p>Though I’m partial to dynamic mics for their proximity, condensers have their place for people who want to turn their home into a full audio studio. There are tons of them and they can get increasingly absurd in price, although there is also a very robust community of <a href="https://groupdiy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people who make DIY mic clones</a> for a fraction of the price, going so far as to source and even make reproductions of Neumann <a href="https://store.arienneaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microphone capsules themselves</a>. On top of that, I have also heard some people on <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/c414-body.83519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forums</a> as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-x3A8Wfg8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> Y<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzhGoFEMvxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outubers</a> rave about the $50-$75 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTVKpKg2EvI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bai Fei Lei C414/Proar C414</a> condenser mic. It is visually a clone of the AKG C414, but a very different mic. I have ordered one from Alibaba to try it out, but I can’t personally attest to its quality or recommend it...yet.</p><h4>4.

Some versions of their newer XLR mics currently still exist on web stores at a huge discount, but I cannot find them on Logitech’s site since the brand was sunset.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Blue Bottle Condenser Microphone Overview - Sweetwater Sound" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6l_u6gSXPc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The classic Blue Bottle mic.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Long ago, Blue’s mics were made in Latvia (Blue stands for Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics) before eventually being outsourced to China. The creator of the Blueberry would go on to work with a company called <a href="http://www.violet-design.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Violet</a>, and then form a company called <a href="https://usashop.jzmic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JZ Microphones</a> that still makes mics in Latvia to this day. I have not tried them because they retail for at least a thousand dollars, but Gearspace users and <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/jz-black-hole" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sound On Sound</a> seem fond of them.</p><figure><figcaption>The spirit of  Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics lives on. Credit: <a href="https://usashop.jzmic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JZ Microphones</a></figcaption></figure><p>After years of being a well-respected microphone company, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jul-21-fi-blue-microphones21-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue would strike it big</a> with the comically cheap Snowball and the Yeti. They would create several variants of the Yeti (Yeti Pro,Yeti X, Yeti Nano). Of them, the Pro with its durable XLR input was the most defensible, but at that point you might as well just get a better microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point “Blue” doesn’t exist; it’s a part of Logitech, a company whose general philosophy and choices I just don’t like. From adding an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132468/logitech-ai-prompt-builder-button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI button</a> to their mice, to idly speculating about a subscription based “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forever Mouse</a>,” Logitech represents a garish and weirdly proprietary strain of hardware I’ve come to despise. Say what you will about the Yeti, a mic that I hate but will begrudgingly admit was an important milestone in home audio, but it didn’t look like LED streamer slop. Look at how they massacred my boy:</p><figure><figcaption>This does not sit well with my soul. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>To Logitech’s credit, the Yeti GX does attempt to solve many of the issues I had with its predecessor. It looks taller, has a single supercardioid Dynamic capsule, is top-firing and has USB-C now. Those changes are too little, too late, and based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i5Bzp5NhSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Podcastage’s review</a> of it I am not a fan of how it sounds. But even if the newer Yeti was a great mic, I would not recommend paying $149.99 for something that looks like that. Blue is dead, there is an ocean of better interfaces and mics to choose from, and most of them won’t <a href="https://youtu.be/EqzE3QOJwBw?si=97GPST2-jfLgyznY&amp;t=936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break the second you take them out of the package</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/descenders-next-revealed-for-2025-will-have-multiple-sports-and-more.945843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have announced&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, a followup to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>that's aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>
<p>Set to launch in 2025 on PC and as a day-one Game Pass release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>won't just revolve around mountain biking like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders">its predecessor</a>. Instead, it'll start with "a couple of deeply-crafted sports", with the developers adding more sports for as long as players stick around.</p>
<p>Initially, the focus in&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be on boarding sports, so you'll be able to indulge in some snowboarding and mountainboarding action. RageSquid and No More Robots say both sports will handle "completely different[ly]", too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=rTnR0Ufl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=l0-oYLe0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is aiming high with a new mix of sports.</figcaption></figure><p>The two studios are promising that&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be "as meaty as&nbsp;<em>Descenders</em>" at launch; it'll feature online multiplayer, "tons of tricks and grinds", and "multiple huge biomes".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether or not the game will pursue the same mixture of procedural and hand-crafted content that the first game featured.</p>
<p>In a press release, No More Robots and RageSquid say&nbsp;<em>Next&nbsp;</em>will offer "a more natural experience" which will feature "procedural off-piste mountains" transitioning into "tight, winding parks and vistas". It sounds to me like there won't be much in the way of hand-crafted areas to explore, but we'll have to see.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>to see if it'll be your extreme cup of tea right here.</p>

<p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>feature plenty of biomes to explore, but it'll also offer a range of objectives to complete, including races, trick challenges, and "scavenger hunts".</p>
<p>Electronic music label Monstercat, which has handled soundtracks for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beat-saber"><em>Beat Saber</em></a>, will provide the soundtrack, and No More Robots and RageSquid describe&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s music as "absolutely banging".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>when it launches on Steam and PC Game Pass sometime next year. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the remainder of 2024, and it's promising iconic characters from big Disney properties, plus new updates and more.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/ValleyVignette" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official website</a> titled "Valley Vignette: What's Next for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>", Gameloft breaks down what's coming to the cozy life sim between now and the end of 2024.</p>
<p>First up, later this month,&nbsp;<em>The Princess and the Frog</em>'s Tiana comes to the Valley, bringing "culinary delights" with her. This month also marks the arrival of a new paid expansion pack for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, and it's themed around stopping Jafar from carrying out his evil schemes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=scTXcf7m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=VGG0p42N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff between now and the end of the year.</figcaption></figure><p>In October, a new update will arrive that brings some important quality-of-life updates, but it'll also introduce the chance to work alongside&nbsp;<em>The Lion King</em>'s Timon and Pumbaa to stop an "invasion of Night Mites".</p>
<p>Then, later in 2024, Gameloft will be airing a new Showcase, where you'll learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>for the rest of 2024, as well as what's happening throughout 2025.</p>
<p>One of the things that's being teased for the remainder of this year appears to be a&nbsp;<em>Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;</em>crossover; in the preview for "late 2024", the roadmap invites you to "stitch a new mystery together", and Sally's dress from the aforementioned movie can clearly be seen.</p>
<p>In the next year or so, Gameloft also says it'll be dedicating some time to improving some of&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>'s features, including Photo Mode, decoration, wardrobe organization, and more. The game's next update will also add PlayStation crossplay at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=agK6gEZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=0nv2ZZlA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect lots more fun Disney characters to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>over the next year or so.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, it's a cozy life sim that invites you to start a new life in the titular Valley, getting to know a raft of Disney characters and making friends with them as you do so.</p>
<p>Since the game launched back in 2022 (although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-10-release-date">1.0 release technically arrived last year</a>), new Disney characters from properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-laugh-floor-update"><em>Monsters, Inc.</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-april-update-brings-simba-nala-and-much-more"><em>The Lion King</em></a>, and many more have been added, and plenty of new activities and quality-of-life improvements have been introduced as well.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401590/Disney_Dreamlight_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/disney-dreamlight-valley/9nsf0bgh8d86" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/disney-dreamlight-valley-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
There's now a release date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the upcoming video game tie-in to the Emily Blunt-starring post-apocalyptic horror movie franchise. 
</p>
<p>
The Road Ahead, which looks to tell its own original story within the world of the franchise's three films (and counting), will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 17th October. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of the film series will recognise its creepy alien antagonists are back, and fans of the excellent Alien Isolation have already been comparing The Road Ahead's gameplay favourably with that survival horror classic.

<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was first announced back in 2021 as being in development at Stormind Games, the studio behind Remothered: Tormented Fathers. 
</p>
<p>It was then properly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">revealed by publisher Saber Interactive back in June this year</a> with a new trailer.</p>
<p>
You play as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, who must not to make any noise lest she alert any extra-terrestrial horrors. But aliens aren't the only problem - there's plenty of other threats to deal with in the ruins of civilisation - how very 2024.
</p>
<p>
One to keep a (quiet) eye on as the nights begin to draw in...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fall-guys-makes-its-way-into-fortnite-with-fall-guys-islands/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fall Guys has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">official collaboration</a> with Fortnite that has been released today. In this collaboration, players can participate in brand-new maps called Fall Guys Islands. There are six Fall Guys Islands in total, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fall-guys-dives-into-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all hand crafted by Mediatonic</a>. Three of these maps were also created in cooperation with Studio 568 and Spiral House.</p>
<p>Players can explore these colorful maps via the "Fall Guys" row in Discover. These maps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falling Up</li>
<li>Tumble Towers</li>
<li>Blunderdrome Blast</li>
<li>Hex-a-Gone Unlimited</li>
<li>Bean Circuit</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these curated maps, Fortnite Creators can also make their own Fall Guys Islands if they wish. The tools needed for these maps went live on July 23 in UEFN and Creative. There is also the potential for any of the maps made with the Fall Guys template to qualify for a place on the Fall Guys row in the Discover section.</p>
<p>In addition to Fall Guys Islands, there is a massive obstacle course coming to Fortnite. This obstacle course is called "Where We Fallin'" and will be available for players to participate in from now through August 15. The aim is to track down one of the several Bean Idols that are hidden throughout the Classy Courts. Once you interact with one, you'll transform into a Fall Guys bean and be able to participate in the obstacle course in the sky.</p>
<p>There are also "Where We Fallin'" quests that players can participate in to earn rewards. Per Battle Royale match, players have three attempts to set a time, but can only complete the obstacle course once per match. If you manage to complete the obstacle course in or under 120 seconds, you'll get your hands on some loot for the rest of the match.</p>
<p>If you've been playing Fortnite and wished you could see yourself as a Fall Guys bean, this collab will allow you to do just that. Your outfit will morph into a Fall Guys bean during the obstacle course, in the Lobby and Locker if you have a Fall Guys Island selected, as well as when you are roaming the Fall Guys Islands.</p>
<p>Depending on what outfit you have equipped will alter how your Fall Guys bean will look. Once you've completed the obstacle island or you are no longer on a Fall Guys Island, your outfit will revert back to normal. For those who are using outfits that don't belong to a default Fortnite character, your bean appearance will automatically transform into the default bean from Fall Guys.</p>

    <p><span>Due out first for Xbox and PC in 2025.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > No More Robots [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/no-more-robots">No More Robots</a> and developer <a title="Companies > RageSquid" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ragesquid">RageSquid</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Descenders Next" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a></em>, a multiple extreme sports follow-up to the downhill biking game <em>Descenders</em>. It will launch first for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and Microsoft Store in 2025, as well as via <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Game Pass, followed by <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> at a later date. A representative for No More Robots told <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> that while a Switch version is doubtful, it will likely appear on Nintendo’s next console. <span id="more-903732"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><em>Descenders Next</em> is the long-anticipated follow-up to downhill biking hit <em>Descenders</em>.</p><p><em>Descenders Next</em> will aim to become the only extreme <a title="Genres > Sports [562 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports game</a> you’ll ever need, starting life with a couple of deeply-crafted sports, and slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time.</p><p>Building on the success of <em>Descenders</em>—which has seen 30 million players since it launched six years ago—<em>Descenders Next</em> is the natural evolution of the original experience. We asked ourselves: Where do we go from <em>Descenders</em>? How do we deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed, but expand beyond mountain biking? From there, the idea of perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports was born.</p><p>When <em>Descenders Next</em> launches in 2025, it will begin life with a focus on boarding sports. Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding <a title="Genres > Action [2,051 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of <em>Next</em>.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_903736"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Descenders Next</em> will already be as meaty as <em>Descenders</em> when it launches, with full online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [356 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore. Players will earn rep as they scale the mountain, and use that to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more to customize their rider.</p><p>Last time around, <em>Descenders</em> provided both procedurally-generated tracks, as well as a selection of hand-crafted parks. With Descenders Next we’ve brought it all together with a more natural experience, as players will tackle procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks, and vistas.</p><p>The parks in particular will provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next’s playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you’ll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you’ll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest.</p><p>Top it all off with an absolutely banging soundtrack from Monstercat, and you’ve got even more reasons to spend hours on the slopes, chilling out to the latest in drum and bass hits.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-officially-confirmed.945810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover is on the way, although it's a fair ways off at the moment.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1820580582767870187" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>X (formerly known as Twitter) account, the crossover is set to arrive in the popular multiplayer horror game in summer next year, which seems an awful long time to wait.</p>
<p>That's all you're getting for now: confirmation that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>are crossing over, and a rough release window of "summer 2025". You'll have to wait a little while for more, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-announcement.jpg?itok=GjDBIDzy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-announcement.jpg?itok=jvvPwHm5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is getting a&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover, and...that's pretty much all we know.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we can speculate about what exactly might make its way to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>from&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>.</p>
<p>It's probably not a stretch to assume that Freddy Fazbear will be added as a killer, and we may well see a couple of the other animatronics as well. Some of the main characters of the games could also be added as survivors.</p>
<p>Given how far off the collaboration is, we might also be getting a new map or something equally substantial. After all, it seems a little strange to make players wait a whole year for just a new killer or survivor.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's probably going to be a while before we hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover, but don't worry; there's plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied in the meantime.</p>

<p>What's more, if you want to take a break from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>but still want to remain immersed in the game's extensive lore, then you'll be pleased to know the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">release date for story-based spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>&nbsp;</em>was recently revealed, and it's landing next month.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-psvr2-working-on-pc-isnt-as-easy-as-it-should-be</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/getting-psvr2-working-on-pc-isnt-as-easy-as-it-should-be.945807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-psvr2-working-on-pc-isnt-as-easy-as-it-should-be<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Sony's Playstation VR2 PC Adapter is set to go on sale from tomorrow but, before you go rushing off to buy one straight away, in my experience, getting the PS VR2 working on PC isn't nearly as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>I was planning on having a review on the site ready for launch, but it turns out the PS VR2's Sense Controllers are very flakey when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity. Even though I have the required Bluetooth adapter built into my PC, constant connection losses meant that I couldn't even make it past the headset's initial setup process on PC. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-08-06-at-12.20.21.png?width=1200&amp;height=1200&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Trying to connect things to Bluetooth is a nightmare in most cases, but the Sense Controller connection process nearly sent me over the edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While waiting to hear back from Sony about my issues, I did a bit of digging on the device's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/" target="_blank">support site</a> and found this line of text hidden away near the bottom, "Some Bluetooth® adapters may not be compatible with your PlayStation®VR2 PC adapter. For more information on Bluetooth® adapters, visit the link below."</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank">link</a> leads to a page which gives a list of four external Bluetooth adapters that "have been confirmed to work by SIE as of 07/20/2024, but operation is not guaranteed." Those adapters are the TP-Link UB500, Buffalo BSBT5D205BK, ASUS USB-BT500 and the IO-DATA USB-BT50LE.  </p>
<p>I've got a TP-Link UB500 on the way from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Multiple-Receiver-UB500/dp/B09C25VRXD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2IIFX5F8ENDUL&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aqNzWF93tr2a0TsigRKNpw0b8J5vZGkmz4Uo6jYLehPNrlRqslq4koaLHnAhCh9iIry241V0B38WdxPbHNs5knfPNKhR1VYf5BXj3zODvuBIhEZ3fRHpjyrDI6x28LELNYGTdJEcNBm9VyxgJr7S89ayFjZmPY-t9k0ZqOuAK4vt4tVLjigPM2pe4FD3CJDDlpANr7_kQic2LBaUnJGIS9QMaMJWXY2eiCJsQ-xxwuY.R9pu9S-T5Tn0mj5tmW8mZtSBuSIi_KryutAiFggZ6DQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=TP-Link+UB500&amp;qid=1722946547&amp;sprefix=tp-link+ub500%2Caps%2C75&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Amazon</a> now, and it's due to turn up tomorrow so hopefully my full coverage won't be delayed too much by this little bump in the road. Either way, I strongly suggest you look into buying a separate Bluetooth dongle if you're planning on picking up the Playstation VR2 PC Adapter - unless you actually <em>want</em> to experience an hour's worth of frustration like I did, that is. </p>
<p>While the Bluetooth issue came as a surprise to me, Sony has been quite vocal about the fact that you will need to buy a separate DisplayPort 1.4 cable in order to connect the PS VR2 to your PC. There isn't one included in the packaging for the Playstation VR2 PC Adapter so if you don't have a spare lying around, picking up one of these cables along with one of the suggested Bluetooth dongles will hopefully save you a lot of time and frustration during that initial setup process.</p>
<p>Seriously, PS VR2 owners have been waiting long enough to play Half Life: Alyx on the headset, so don't delay that process any further if you can help it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange has crashed significantly, causing huge losses to major Japanese game companies. Companies such as Nintendo, Sega, Capcom and Square Enix are among the companies to experience a drop. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's stock market has been plummeting for three consecutive days. As of August 5, 2024, the stock market dropped by 4,451.28 Yen from the previous day, which has gone on to make it the biggest drop since the crash of the stock market in 1987.</p>
<p>Out of the Japanese game companies that were affected, CAVE was affected the most on this day. They experienced a 23% drop, with Capcom following behind at 16%. Square Enix was the least affected company, experiencing a drop of 5%, as shown by <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1820331372935848112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820331372935848112%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics shared on X</a>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo also experienced a significant amount of loss. They saw a decline in their stocks for three consecutive days, causing them to hit a new low for the year. This comes at a relatively rough time for Nintendo, as they had just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">their financial report</a> for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. In this report, it was revealed that they are experiencing heavy declines in sales, with a 46% drop in sales and a 70% decline in operating profits.</p>
<p>Capcom hit the limit down (which is when the maximum amount the price of a stock can decrease in a single trading day happens,) despite Capcom saying that they had positive forecasts for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Of course, the Tokyo Stock market crashing significantly didn't just affect companies like Nintendo, Capcom and Square Enix. It also affected major tech companies, such as NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p>To some, the crash of the stock market doesn't come as much of a surprise. There were many factors that helped cause the market to crash, such as the massive amount of concerns over the US economy, as well as the rapid appreciation of the Yen against the dollar. To counteract this, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bank of Japan</a> has raised the interest rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, which helped the Yen gain significantly after this decision.</p>
<p>Whether the stock market will continue to crash or whether it will slowly return to normal remains to be seen, but this event helps serve as a stark reminder of just how volatile the stock market can be for those who choose to trade and purchase shares.</p>
<p>With the significant dip that Nintendo has experienced, people are considering buying up Nintendo shares so that they will make a decent profit once their losses have balanced back out to a normal level.</p>

Set in the “Purribean” with a whimsical piracy theme, <em>Cat Quest 3</em> doesn’t just see you fighting on land and in dungeons and castles. You’ll also take to the sea in your very own ship, where enemy vessels will pose their own unique challenges. With a variety of fun sidequests, dungeons to explore, and the ultimate quest of finding the North Star Treasure, <em>Cat Quest 3</em> provides a jovial and entertaining adventure that’s well worth your time if you enjoy light-hearted action-RPG shenanigans.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196086" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div><h4> What platforms is <em>Cat Quest 3</em> available for?   </h4><p> <em>Cat Quest 3</em> launches on August 8 for  PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows. It  runs flawlessly on Steam Deck, which was where I spent the majority of  my time. <em>Cat Quest 3</em> is also best experienced with a gamepad  and, in my opinion, is a perfect portable game as evidenced by my time  with it on Steam Deck.   </p></div><p>In the roughly five-or-so hours I’ve spent with <em>Cat Quest 3</em>, I’ve had a blast. While the repetitious soundtrack grates a bit, the core combat and gameplay loop are wildly satisfying. Once I got the hang of things and learned to dodge effectively and put together a solid build, I quickly got hooked on sailing the seas of the Purribean to seek out new equipment and get into more engaging fights. And while the story is mostly lighthearted fun, it’s proving to be somewhat intriguing as I come to learn exactly who my kitty is in the game’s lore and just what my spiritual pirate companion is up to.</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-recommend-id="image://69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-recommend-id="image://69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’re gonna be doing a lot of brawling in <em>Cat Quest 3</em>, so it’s a good thing the combat here is a lot of fun. You can switch between your melee and ranged weapon at the push of a button. While there is ammo for your ranged weapons, it recharges over time so you don’t have to worry about keeping track of it. The same is true of your magical resource, mana. Different items will augment how quickly mana and ammo recharges, and even grant new ways of fighting, such as the ability to deal damage by rolling into enemies.</p><p>And don’t let the game’s cuteness fool you; the combat here isn’t without its challenges. Early on, you’ll quickly encounter enemies throughout the world who punch harder than you, soak up way more damage, and often outnumber you as well. Luckily, you can gear up with new weapons and spells to take on the new threats, and thankfully there’s more to beating your opponents than just increasing an assortment of power numbers. New equipment, and particularly spells, really shake the game up in some satisfying ways. </p><p>Take spells, for instance. Right now I’ve got two that I’m digging: a fireball that does a limited amount of persistent damage, and the ability to spawn ice shards on the ground which both damage enemies and also slow them down. That last part is particularly great for dealing with groups of foes as I can slow them down to target specific ones. These different spells can combine in some satisfying ways, too: I can slow down an opponent with my ice spell, which also does damage. I can then follow that up with a fireball that deals persistent damage. As they’re both slowed by the ice and taking damage from the fireball, I can empty my flintlock pistol into them, then switch back to my melee which recharges my mana with each strike thanks to an item I have equipped. </p><figure id="" data-id="e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-recommend-id="image://e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-recommend-id="image://e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This combination of spells and equipment can lead to very satisfying techniques you can deploy against groups of enemies or in one-on-one showdowns. And because finding a new item, spell, or weapon can add to your arsenal of attacks, the game inspires a wonderful forward momentum to go out, explore, pillage, and grow in power. And it’s all brought to life with excellent sound effects and wonderfully fun animations that often look as silly and enjoyable as watching animals play-fighting.</p><p>What I haven’t found as satisfying early on, however, is the ship combat. While I was able to quickly grow in power with my swords, guns, and spells, ship upgrades have proved more elusive. I suspect this is somewhat intentional as your ship is necessary to cross the ocean to other islands, and so a weaker ship keeps you focused on the earlier areas instead of letting you chart off to more difficult fights before you’re ready (you can swim in a life preserver, but you’ll get chewed up pretty quickly by hostile ships and have no way to fight back). I also found firing the ship’s cannons accurately to be a bit of a challenge. Thus far I’ve come out of most ship battles pretty banged up. That I’ve already gotten pretty powerful on land but still suck out in the waters makes the game feel a little discordant, so I’m hoping to find some new upgrades for my ship soon.</p><p><em>Cat Quest 3</em> also has some wonderful visual flair. With its vivid, cheery, and diverse color palette that mixes things up across the different regions of the Purribean, the whole experience really pops on Steam Deck OLED, and it’s all rendered with a generous draw distance that conveys an excellent sense of scale.</p><figure id="" data-id="a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-recommend-id="image://a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-recommend-id="image://a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h8084"><a id=""></a>This music is pushing it, though</h2><p>Sadly, despite the game’s many charms, the music has dampened my desire to spend more time with <em>Cat Quest 3</em>. Don’t get me wrong, the production value is excellent…it’s just, listening to pirate shanty-themed music for an extended period of time really wore on me. I was delighted when I’d come across a dungeon or something that’d change up the soundtrack. Unfortunately, since the difficulty of combat will see you spending a bit of time doing some gentle grinding (which rarely feels <em>like</em> a grind given how fun the combat is), you’ll end up exposed to the same pirate-y melodies over and over and over again. </p><p>To its credit, the composition tries its best to mix things up even in the main overworld region, but after a couple of hours I’d find this music stuck in my head as I went about my daily errands. As someone who can find such whimsical melodies grating, it wasn’t great having them on loop in my head. This is the only thing that’s made me hesitate to jump back in (and I might lower the music volume a touch when I do). </p><hr><p><br><em>Cat Quest 3</em> is a joyful, silly, and satisfying way to spend time as a cute little cat pirate. Despite the allergic reaction I’m experiencing to its soundtrack, I’m looking forward to jumping back in to level up my gear, learn some new spells, and continue my search for the mysterious North Star Treasure. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/cat-quest-3-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Much like a band or singer-songwriter looking to shake things up and explore new aural delights for a third album, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cat-quest-iii">Cat Quest 3</a> takes to the high seas in search of a refreshing change of pace after a pair of medieval fantasy adventures. This time, the punniest action RPG out there is all about pirates and a quest of legendary booty of the North Star.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - Release Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5TQm1N8vuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a fresh tale of predestination and prophecies in Cat Quest 3, with the opening cutscene showing the Pi-Rat King sinking a ship on the open waters, with the only survivor being a kitten in a wicker basket. That little kitty is discovered by the spirit of Captain Cappey, who shepherds you through to adulthood and then journeys with and encourages you on your adventure of piracy across the Purribean. The good and honourable kind of piracy, though, where you’ll still deliver mail between NPCs and not just terrorise shipping lanes.</p>


<p>Of course, since you’re now a pirate, that means you’ll spend a fair amount of time on a ship of your own, which adds a new layer to the action RPG battling you’ll still find on land. It’s a nice, albeit light, change that still feels very much in keeping with the on-land action, though the ship has a distinct turning circle and momentum, and you’ll have to manage its own set of upgrades.</p>


<p>While it’s perfectly in keeping with the rest of the game, I did wish for a little more depth to the ship combat though. Your cannons auto-aim within an arc before you, instead of having broadside batteries like you might expect, so it actually feels more like you’re dogfighting in planes instead of ships – strangely, even the most basic enemy ships have full 360º aiming. It’s also a pain that you can’t repair your ship without it first being destroyed, which you have to swim next to in your life preserver for a few moments to restore. Racing away to get back to a little jetty and summoning your ship just brings it back to you in the same condition, so where you have a spell to heal up your kitty between rest point cat naps, it’s the ship is more restrictive feeling.</p>
<p>Of course, the bulk of the action still takes place on land – which still has the same kind of scale as a traditional RPG overworld – and this is a solid iteration on the previous two games. You now have a main melee weapon with a secondary gun or wand to switch to (as opposed to swapping characters) and can equip up to four magic spells, with spell slots being charged up by your regular attacks.</p>

<p>It’s all nice and simplistic, and allows you to focus more on the enemies that you’re facing and dodging their attacks, whether it’s a pi-rat butt stomp, a hog charge attack, swooping bird or various elemental enemies. While it’s hardly Dark Souls difficulty, the combat’s got some claws to watch out for and I personally found it can be deceptively easy to get carried away and take a lot of damage. Boss battles all feel nice and distinct, and will often push you in a new direction, whether that’s making use of elemental weapons or leaning more on ranged attacks and magic – if ever I was taking the wrong approach to an enemy, a few deaths would have me buck up my ideas!</p>
<p>The loot you gather on your adventure is kept simple and to the point. There’s a menagerie of different hats and armour, as well as a variety of swords, axes, shields and guns, but instead of Diablo-esque loot where everything has different stat rolls, once you’ve got something, it can stay with you through the full adventure. Pick up a duplicate and it will bump up the level of your existing gear, and if you feel you need a little bit more juice in your attacks, you can head back to the one main port in the game and throw money and magic crystals to level up anything you’ve got.</p>
<p>As in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/cat-quest-ii-review/">Cat Quest 2</a>, all of this can be played in co-op, which is a nice and fun inclusion, though one I only dabbled with briefly while reviewing. It means you’ve got a little bit of slack in battle, as your buddy can come and pick you back up – just beware of getting hit while you’re stationary – and you can kit yourselves out with complimentary gear, and you’ll have to since you’re sharing an inventory. It does generally help to chop and change between different elements at times, so the ice wand lets you dodge through fire damage, while the shields are great for blocking rolling enemies and damaging them back. The main oddity in co-op is that you only get one ship,which is fine, but unusual when you can both control the same vessel.</p>

<p>You can quite quickly rattle through the main quest and story of the game, with your kitty chasing after the Pi-rat King, hunting down ancient keys and the like, but there’s a bunch of side quests like delivering mail, catching catfish, hunting down books, and optional dungeons with bounties to collect. All of the story is delivered with the same kind of pitch purrfect punning that’s positively pawesome, and there’s a good dose of foreshadowing for later twists, and callbacks to the overarching narrative of the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>roadmap, so now you know what kind of content you can look forward to from this single-player adventure over the next year or so.</p>
<p>The season pass includes a mission that's exclusive to&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' Season Pass, as well as a character pack, two cosmetic bundles, and two major story expansions, which takes us up to spring next year.</p>
<p>If you've been keeping up with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>news, you'll probably recognize the exclusive mission, which is "Jabba's Gambit". Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-season-pass-ubisoft">made sure to clarify</a> back in April that this mission isn't the only chance you'll get to see Jabba the Hutt.</p>

<p>Following that, this fall, you'll get the first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC in the form of&nbsp;<em>Wild Card</em>, which will see Kay crossing paths with Lando Calrissian as she infiltrates a Sabacc tournament.</p>
<p>If you're a Season Pass holder, you'll also get two cosmetic bundles, both of which contain new looks for Kay, Nix, your speeder, and the Trailblazer ship.</p>
<p>Lastly for this roadmap,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, the second&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC pack, is coming in spring next year. It'll see Kay meeting up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka and taking on a "ruthless gang of pirates" alongside him.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 30th</a>. It's Ubisoft's open-world foray into the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe, and it combines traversal across a range of beautiful&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>worlds with third-person shooting, stealth, and climbing-based platforming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-august-line-up-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next lineup of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass over the first half of August, and it's headlined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-nostalgia-done-right-and-that-includes-the-irritations">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Is this one game? Is this technically three? Regardless, get ready to play (or replay) Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped on cloud, console and PC from this Thursday 8th August. 
</p>
<p>
Coming to Xbox Game Pass this month:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creatures of Ava (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) - 7th August </li>
<li>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 8th August </li>
<li>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 13th August</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not a long list of games, to be sure, but if you're yet to try the souped up Mafia remake then that is definitely worth a look. A ground-up rebuilding of the first Mafia tale, this takes place in 1930s America and sees Tommy-gun-toting title character Tommy Angelo trying to make his way in a world of organised crime. 
</p>
<p>"A mostly thorough remake of 2002's original, Mafia: Definitive Edition has its moments - but it struggles by the standards of today," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-definitive-edition-review-a-generous-remake-that-still-shows-some-age">Eurogamer's Mafia: Definitive Edition review</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/action-adventure-critter-saving-game-creatures-of-ava-releases-later-this-year">Creatures of Ava</a>, meanwhile, launches in to Game Pass this week. This colourful creature-saving fantasy action-adventure looks like it could be something special. It's co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

</p>
<ul>
<li>Airborne Kingdoms (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Offworld Trading Company (PC)</li>
<li>Shadow Warrior 3 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

The original games were punishing, and if anything, the trilogy ups some of the challenge in certain ways. These Vicarious Visions ports do a great job of showcasing the colorful platform puzzling that made Crash an icon back in the day. </p><p>Here’s everything  coming to Game Pass <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/06/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/06/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the first half of August</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Creatures of Ava</em> (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – August 7</li><li><em>Crash Bandicoot N.

Finally, <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s 2v8 game mode is available to try on the service until August 8. <em>Valorant </em>isn’t part of Game Pass, but it is free-to-play and shadow dropped on console yesterday, in case you needed a new hero-based tactical shooter to add to your rotation. </p><p>  <em>N.

It seems like instead of blitzing the service with the company’s back catalog all at once—like it did with <em>Fallout</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> after the Bethesda acquisition—Microsoft will be taking its time. However, there’s still no word yet on when <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2</em> will land on Game Pass. </p><p> .</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/AQuietPlaceGame/status/1820810851340910636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, the team behind A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead revealed that its official release date is set for October 17, 2024.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive also revealed a brief new trailer to coincide with the release date announcement. The trailer features some brand-new footage captured on PC, including both cinematics and gameplay. </p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s new trailer also invites fans to pre-order A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead now, teasing pre-order bonuses. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Players who pre-order earn extra digital content including a Hospital Care Package, Exclusive Concept Art, and a Creature Animation Showcase. The Hospital Care Package features batteries and inhalers, which are usable in-game as seen in today’s new trailer.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Saber Interactive first offered a reveal trailer with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-coming-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broad release window</a> for this year. Last month, they added a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-receives-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tense story trailer</a> featuring 2 minutes of footage that breaks down the basic premise of the game.</p>



<p>Today, fans got a closer look at some more gameplay, teasing medical challenges, enemy encounters, and various obstacles.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s anticipated game is based on the hit series of horror films. Gaming fans can also look forward to an Until Dawn movie, which just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded its cast</a>, an animated show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jb-smoove-high-on-life-animated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on High on Life</a>, and more.</p>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it releases this October.</p>

The bean-based competition game begins its integration into the Fortnite ecosystem in several different ways--with Fortnite creative islands by Fall Guys developer Mediatonic, the ability for users to publish their own Fall Guys maps and, most importantly, an all-new Fall Guys-themed mini-game for battle royale and Zero Build.</p><p>Let's start with that. With this week's update, Fortnite battle royale will now host a Fall Guys mini-game that players can participate in by praising one of the statues of a Fall Guys bean person located around Classy Courts. Once you do, you'll be transformed into a bean person and made to play Fall Guys in an obstacle course in the sky. You'll have 120 seconds to complete it for loot--the faster you get it done, the better your loot will be. You can only complete it once per match, but you get three tries.

But in this case, the choice to participate is entirely yours. Along with the mini-game will be a series of "Where We Fallin'" quests for rewards, including a bean person back bling.</p><p>What's particularly cool about this is that, as with Lego versions of skins, each of your Fortnite original skins will have a unique bean person design. Sadly, none of the current collaboration skins, like Marvel or Star Wars, is getting the bean guy treatment just yet, and so if you're wearing one of those then you'll appear as a generic, naked bean.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912"></a><figcaption>This back bling will be a free quest reward during Fortnite's Where We Fallin' event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg"></figure><p>On top of the battle royale event, Fall Guys is getting six new Fortnite Creative islands from developer Mediatonic, and users can also now publish their own Fall Guys-themed islands as well.</p><p>This summer season has been unusually full of events in Fortnite, starting with Metallica and Reload in June, All Sweat Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean and Tesla in July, and now this Fall Guys stuff in August.

<p>"Although we're incredibly eager to share every fun detail of the game with you, 'Black Myth: Wukong' is a single-player game with an original storyline and unique gameplay," Game Science said on Twitter. "Therefore, we kindly ask that in these last few days before the official release, you avoid spreading any text, images, or videos that might reveal unreleased content, as well as any 'leak information' from unofficial sources."</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 19 for PC and PlayStation 5. The game is also coming to Xbox Series X|S, but fans will have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-delayed-but-only-on-one-platform/1100-6524046/" data-ref-id="1100-6524046">bit longer as that version</a> currently doesn't meet the studio's standards and needs more time for optimization.</p><p>Game Science said that this is its first time launching a game internationally, so the team is looking into the logistics of how to provide physical copies to fans.</p>
