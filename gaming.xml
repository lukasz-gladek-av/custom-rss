The main hook, Chief Experiences Officer David Tinson says, is its tie-ins with EA's various sports games, including the possibility of unlocking prizes like Ultimate Team cards based on the sizzle reel.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-52-27-screenshot-1726608647296.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The EA Sports app is being touted as a new way to engage with sports using EA's existing technology.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Our thesis is simple: With the right products, features, and capabilities, a significant portion of hyper valuable consumer attention is available for a fraction of the cost," Tinson says.</p><p>Ultimately, Tinsons says EA's goal is to create a social app that allows fans to follow their favorite sports and teams while integrating in-game rewards and community elements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tinson showcased a number of features that incorporate EA's technology, including a system that appears to seamelssly translate real-life moments into virtual highlights that can be viewed from any angle using the EA Sports FC engine. EA is also introducing predictive simulations that not only simulate upcoming matches, but can also questions like "who would win between 85 Bears and the 07 Patriots."</p><p>Based on Tinson's presentation, the app appears to make heavy use of AI, featuring prompts that allows users to create its simulations. Generative AI was a big part of EA's overall presentation, and was touted repeatedly in relation to franchises like The Sims and its sports games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/17/electronic-arts-investor-day-2024-1-58-20-screenshot-1726608686364.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>EA claims the new app will let you view highlights from any angle.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The EA Sports app will initially be focused around soccer, making it an extension of one of EA's most popular and successful sports sims in EA Sports FC. Support for other sports will also be added over time, with the NHL, NHL, F1, and NCAA Football all highlighted at various points.</p><p>The new app will soft-launch in Space this fall, and will be supported on iOS and Android devices. In the meantime, EA Sports FC is set to enter early access this week, with a full release on September 27.

According to Seagate's website, this SSD normally retails for $220, so this is a 40% price drop. The Firecuda 530R works equally well as storage expansion for your PS5 console - it will triple your existing storage capacity - or as a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig.</p><h2>2TB Seagate Firecuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h2><div catalogid="77b17120-1386-4338-907b-52882079c649" id="143896"><div id="143896" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Seagate FireCuda 530R 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The Seagate Firecuda 530R is a direct successor to the 530, which was already one of the faster PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSDs on the market. Seagate is pretty tight-lipped about what exact hardware or software changes were made, but we do know that the upgrades include a marked increase in random read and write speeds (IOPS) and a higher endurance rating. The Firecuda 530R boasts sustained read  speeds of 7,800MBps and write speeds of 6,800MBps which is well above Sony's PS5 recommendation of 5,600MBps. It's also equipped with a robust EK-designed aluminum heatsink that's slim enough to fit both PS5 and PS5 slim drive bays (the new 530R removes the EK logo and replaces it with a Seagate logo). Of course, the same specs make it a prime candidate for your gaming PC boot drive. It's still one of the fastest drives on the market and goes toe to toe with other heavy hitters like the Samsung 990 Pro, WD Black SN850X, and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023"><em>best PS5 SSD deals of 2024</em></a><em>.

On paper, the Fusion Pro 4 is a fairly substantial leap forward versus the Fusion Pro 3. Most notably, the new model comes with Hall Effect triggers and sticks, which also support the Quick-Twist feature that lets you adjust the height of your thumbsticks on the fly. </p><p dir="ltr">Other notable features include four remapppable back buttons and a rubberized grip. The controller connects to Xbox Series X|S or PC via an included 10-foot braided USB-C cable, and sports a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the Fusion Pro 3 had swappable sticks, which have been replaced by the Quick-Twist sticks. The only potential downside to this change is that you can no longer have different thumbstick cap options. The Pro 3 came with a pair of short sticks with concave caps, and a pair of tall sticks, one concave and one convex. That said, the Quick-Twist sticks in the Fusion Pro 4 utilize Hall Effect technology to prevent stick drift, and you can lock them in three different positions, so overall it should be a positive change.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fusion Pro 4 should be available to purchase from Amazon soon.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Behaviour Interactive has cancelled its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> four-player co-op spin-off, known only as Project T, after early player testing "yielded unsatisfactory overall results".
</p>
<p>
Project T, developed by Midwinter Entertainment, was an attempt to create a PvE experience set in the Dead by Daylight universe. It would see four players - cast as trespassers in the Entity's realm - tackling new enemies The Thrall using guns, trucks, and talismans.
</p>
<p>
At the time of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-adding-dungeons-dragons-and-castlevania-chapters-this-year">announcement in May</a>, Project T was described as being very early in development, but Behaviour Interactive revealed it would be launching an Insider Programme to gather fan feedback. Unfortunately, it seems the responses weren't especially glowing.

<p>
"When we conceptualised Project T," Behaviour Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262">statement announcing the game's cancellation</a> on social media, "we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which lead to the creation of the Insiders Program. This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on the project's core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game."
</p>
<p>
"Following the playtest in July," the developer continued, "we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective. While a number of players expressed appreciation for what they played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results."
</p>
<p>
"It's with heavy heart," the statement concluded, "that we announce that Project T has been cancelled. We want to thank you for your support throughout this journey."
</p>
<p>
When Project T was unveiled back in May, it was accompanied by news of two additional Dead by Daylight spin-offs. Until Dawn developer Supermassive's narrative adventure The Casting of Frank Stone launched earlier this month, garnering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review">three stars from Eurogamer</a>, while What The Fog - a free two-person co-op roguelite - was only briefly made available.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s new Doug-Cockle-starring animated Witcher movie, Sirens of the Deep, has had its release pushed back from "late" this year to 11th February 2025. But to tide everyone over until then, the streaming service has shared a two-minute clip featuring some familiar faces.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep - Netflix's second animated Witcher movie, following 2021's well-received The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf - begins with Geralt of Rivia investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village, but our gravelly voiced protagonist soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends — old and new," Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-next-animated-witcher-movie-will-star-doug-cockle-as-geralt">previously teased</a>, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, an adaptation of Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, is being directed by Kang Hei Chul, who previously helmed Nightmare of the Wolf. It sees Cockle reprising his role as Geralt - following his iconic turn in CD Projekt's The Witcher series of games - and he's accompanied by The Witcher TV show's Joey Batey as Jaskier. Both feature in Netflix's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8P2Nodqzpc">new two-minute clip</a>, which you'll find above.
</p>
<p>
Batey, of course, is set to return as Jaskier for the final two seasons of Netflix's wildly uneven live-action Witcher adaptation - which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">see Liam Hemsworth stepping into the role of Geralt</a> following Henry Cavill's departure at the end of Season 3.
</p>
<p>
Cockle recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witchers-video-game-voice-star-weighs-in-on-netflix-adaptation">shared his thoughts</a> on the live-action series, admitting, "I don't know why they made those choices and I'd love to have a chat with some of the writers about why those choices were made just so I can intellectually understand why."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tsa-approved-power-bank-deal-20000-mah-for-nintendo-switch-for-19<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Charges the Nintendo Switch up to 2.8 times</h2></div><div><section><p>Starting this week, Amazon is offering the very popular <a href="https://zdcs.link/znOLZy?object_uuid=f0caefd3-3ee2-4dab-8b1a-ac0a38af6ea9&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">INIU 20,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</a> for only $18.89 after you clip the 30% off coupon on the product page. This is a great price for a power bank that features a spacious 20,000mAh capacity and a 22.5W USB Type-C charging output that's enough to max out the charging rate on the Nintendo Switch. INIU hasn't been long around enough to develop the same reputation as Anker, but their power banks have been steadily racking up favorable reviews and they're definitely a lot less expensive than a comparable Anker power bank. This particular model has nearly 20,000 reviews on Amazon with a 4.6-star rating.</p><h2>INIU 20,000mAh Power Bank for $18.89</h2><p><em><strong>Clip the 30% off coupon</strong></em></p><div catalogid="97fbf52d-392a-4fd5-b10f-ab8444983cbb" id="207506"><div id="207506" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>INIU 20,000mAh 22.5W Power Bank</h3></p></div><p>The INIU power bank is pretty compact for its capacity, measuring 5.3"x2.8"x1". It's also one of the lighter 20,000mAh power banks, weighing in at 12.8 ounces.  The power bank features three ports: two USB Type-A ports and one USB Type-C ports. The USB Type-C ports is both input and output and has the highest charging capacity at 22.5W. The Nintendo Switch supports a maximum charging rate of 18W, so this power bank will charge the Switch in the shortest amount of time possible. The 20,000mAh capacity will charge a Nintendo Switch about 2.8 times even after factoring in 60% charging efficiency. That should be more than enough for all but the longest trips.  It's worth mentioning that the INIU power bank also has a little LED flashlight for emergencies.</p><h2>The INIU Power Bank is TSA-Approved</h2><p>Spare lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only. Power banks must be under either 27,000mAh or 100Whr in capacity. This INIU power bank features a 20,000mAh battery capacity, which is well below TSA's 27,000mAh limit, so it can be brought onto airplanes without worry. This power bank is small and discreet enough that it's hard to imagine TSA even noticing the power bank in the first place.</p><p><em>Looking for more alternatives?

Image source: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p>A commenter claiming to be Karch weighed in on a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBUqCUZ0swE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Asmongold</a> focusing on Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, where they expounded on what they considered to be the state of the modern games industry. The full comment is below.</p><blockquote>Hey man. CEO of Saber here. I love your videos. When we signed the deal to make Space Marine 2, all I wanted was a throwback game. We had the chance to work on something which by its nature was "old school". I can't even comprehend many of the current games that we play these days.<p> They are too complex and too much of an investment. We worked on Halo back in the day, and that game could be distilled down to the simplest of shooting loops, but it was entirely addicting. That is what we wanted to recapture. I hope that games like Space Marine 2 and Wukong are the start of a reversion to a time when games were simply about fun and immersion.</p></blockquote><blockquote>I spent some time as Chief Operating Officer at Embracer and I saw games there that made me want to cry with their overblown attempts at messaging or imposing morals on gamers. We just want to do some glory kills and get the heart rate up a little. For me that is what games should be about.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The comment quickly got picked up and began making the rounds on various social platforms, with some wondering if the comment was actually from Karch. IGN reached out to the Embracer Group asking for confirmation one way or another, but did not receive a response. The account purporting to belong to Karch has no videos and 197 subscribers.</p><p>Saber Interactive is fresh off the release of Space Marine 2, which arrived in early September and quickly amassed around 2 million players. A sequel to a fan-favorite Xbox 360 release, it has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-next-gen-xbox-360-shooter-best-way-possible">drawn comparisons to other shooters from that era</a>.</p><p>"Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 may not break the third-person shooter mold, but it looks amazing, makes good use of its Warhammer lore, and has brutal combat that just feels great," we wrote in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">our review</a>.</p><p>Space Marine 2 is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Project T had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-8th-anniversary-stream-everything-announced">begun testing with insiders earlier this year</a>. </p><p>"Following the playtest in July, we ran through internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective," Behaviour said in the statement, which you can read in full below.

The multiplayer battle royale about wizards throwing down the gauntlet – a wide variety of them, in fact – conjured visions of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> when it was at its best, with players hurling boulders and whipping up tornadoes as they frantically flitted about the battlefield. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/spellbreak-is-avatar-the-last-airbender-the-battle-ro-1844999545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive reviews</a>, the game wasn’t able to maintain a large enough audience, and in 2022 developer Proletariat announced that it would be <a href="https://www.gamedaily.biz/spellbreak-servers-will-shut-down-in-2023-blizzard-to-acquire-developer-proletariat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down the game’s servers and joining Blizzard</a>. But unlike a great many other games that have faced the same fate, <em>Spellbreak </em>remains playable.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/DominicTarason/status/1835788217066328209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> by ever-reliable indie game guy Dominic Tarason, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s dev team posted a free version of the game that <a href="https://sbcommunity.itch.io/spellbreak-community-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lets players host their own servers</a> not long after announcing the shutdown.&nbsp;</p><p>“Like many of you, we were sad to see the development of <em>Spellbreak </em>come to a close,” wrote <em>Spellbreak</em>’s developers. “In order to help memorialize <em>Spellbreak </em>and allow players to continue to enjoy the Hollow Lands, we created a standalone version where players can host their own servers, play with their friends, and explore the game-space at their own pace.”</p><p>In the intervening period, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s community has created a Discord server with over 5,000 users called Elemental Fracture that hosts daily games, weekly events, and provides other resources. They’ve even <a href="https://elefrac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put together their own launcher</a> to make the process of getting the game up and running simpler. You can <a href="http://dsc.gg/elefrac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">join the server here</a>, if you’d like.&nbsp;</p><p>“Elemental Fracture emerged from this unique moment in <em>Spellbreak</em>'s history,” wrote one of the server’s moderators in its “Who We Are” section. “Our mission is simple yet powerful: we want to bring our <em>Spellbreak </em>community together to resurrect the game we love. Whether you're a seasoned pro who has been part of <em>Spellbreak</em>'s journey from the beginning or someone discovering this captivating game for the first time, we wholeheartedly welcome you to our community. Here, friendships are made and flourish, skills sharpen, and the passion for <em>Spellbreak </em>burns brighter than ever. Join us on this exciting adventure of reviving this wonderful game.”</p><p>This, if you ask me, is what <em>should </em>happen any time a company is forced to pull the plug on a server-based game: Let players preserve it to whatever degree they’re able. As is, 87 percent of games released before 2010 are unplayable, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Video Game History Foundation</a>, and the proliferation of competitive multiplayer games in the years since means that number is likely to rise. There’s only one way to stem the tide, and we’re looking at it right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We already knew another Star Wars Jedi game was in the works at developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>, but EA has now confirmed it'll be the "final chapter" in Cal Kestis' saga.
</p>
<p>
Not-quite-official word of a third Star Wars Jedi game first surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-3-is-on-the-way-according-to-cal-kestis-actor-cameron-monaghan">last October</a> when Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan told fans, "We're in the process of [making it] right now". Formal confirmation of its development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">followed this February</a>, shared as part of a projects update in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">significant layoffs</a> at EA.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, speaking during EA's latest <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">Investor Day presentation</a>, the company's president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, has shared the first bit of solid information on Star Wars Jedi's third instalment, confirming it to be the last. "Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi," Miele said. "Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> director Stig Asmussen - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-and-survivor-director-stig-asmussen-is-leaving-ea">departed EA last year</a> - previously revealed the series had been envisaged as a trilogy during a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">IGN</a>. "We had a pretty decent idea of timeframe where we wanted Survivor to take place," he explained, "what the stakes were going to be, what the tone of the game was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how the crew was going to factor into that. And there's ideas of what we could do beyond that as well."
</p>
<p>
However, today's announcement confirms Respawn is now officially bringing Cal Kestis' story to a close, even if no other details have so far been shared.
</p>
<p>
All this Star Wars Jedi chatter coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-september-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">today's launch</a> of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and follows the recent release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-fresh-pc-patch-17-months-after-release">new Star Wars Jedi: Survivor patch for PC</a>, promising performance fixes, the removal of Denuvo DRM, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA confirmed that The Sims 5 wasn't and isn't in the works<span>. Instead, they are focusing on funneling more into The Sims 4, a ten-year-old title. A couple of months ago,<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">&nbsp;Project Rene</a> seemed like it was scrapped, according to a developer's resume. However,&nbsp;<span>according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">Variety's statement</a></span>, this does not seem to be</span>&nbsp;the case, and they are continuing to work on Project Rene, which is said to be a separate multiplayer project in The Sims universe.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has also confirmed that there are no plans for a successor to The Sims 4, which is currently the longest-running installment in the franchise's history. The first game was released 25 years ago. It's been confirmed that The Sims 4 will continue receiving free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>In addition to The Sims 4 continuing to receive paid content, EA has confirmed that the Sims team is working on a new project that will include a multiplayer mode, as well as partnering up with some Sims creators so that they can sell their custom in-game content through the EA store, similar to how it was done in The Sims 3.</p>
<p>Kate Gorman said that the main reason they have decided not to make The Sims 5 is an overwhelming concern that players would have to "start all over again" after a decade's worth of gameplay in The Sims 4. There are more than 80 million players worldwide, with a very active social media community. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise starts with Sims 1, and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products."</p>
<p>Recently, EA announced in a blog post that some significant fixes will be released for the game, something the fans have consistently asked for when providing feedback for EA. They are also releasing an "exciting base game update" before their upcoming expansion in October, for which they are slowly releasing information. In this <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, they revealed the Life and Death expansion, where players will get their first proper look at the content on October 3 before it releases on Halloween. So far, it seems to focus on tarot and perhaps new jobs and skills.</p>

<p>In this interview with Variety, EA also mentioned that Sims fans will get to hear more about the elusive Project Rene, which the Sims team has been working on for years. This isn't their first rodeo in trying to make a multiplayer Sims game, with The Sims Online launching in 2002 and the game shutting down entirely in 2008, which was seen as a failed experiment.</p>

And while it’s been extremely popular, for nearly a decade the PC version of <em>GTA Online</em> has lacked a proper anti-cheat system to stop players from easily using mod menus and other tools to cause chaos and gain unfair advantages.

Players will still be able to enjoy <em>GTA V’</em>s story mode on Deck, but no online play is supported. </p><p>And to be clear: This isn’t entirely the fault of BattlEye, which is in many games, some of which work on the Linux-powered Steam Deck. Rockstar could, in theory, update <em>GTA Online </em>to support BattlEye on Steam Deck in a future patch, but the next part of the FAQ seems to suggest that might not happen. Here’s what Rockstar says about <em>GTA V</em> on Steam Deck: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Note:</strong> GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve’s Steam Deck support content and community.</p></blockquote><p>That seems like Rockstar washing its hands of the situation and moving on.

But, it’s just more evidence that Rockstar seems to be working on a PC port of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252"><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a></span>. That open-world western has been trapped on consoles ever since it launched in 2010. Over the last year or so, evidence seems to be building that maybe, just maybe, <em>RDR </em>will finally get the PC port it deserves. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The simplified explanation given is that currently packets are sent twice between players, but the industry standard is four times. In order to achieve this, the XDefiant team needs to reduce the size of their packets so they can send them more times. No solid release date was given, but the team hopes to make significant progress by the end of Season 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766"></a><figcaption>Season 2 will add the Highwaymen from Far Cry New Dawn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is in trouble at Ubisoft, although it doesn't respond directly to some of the claims.

He fell in love with photography later in life and approached it like a programmer, thinking very hard about the inputs of shots, and what kind of outcomes they'd produce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Fall 2009 he was published a (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/archived-issue/">still-archived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) story called "Better Photos—No Cost" in a Maryland magazine called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/">Outlook by the Bay</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a publication for senior citizens of the Chesapeake Bay region. It documents the basics of photography he didn't just share with me but seemed obsessed with everyone having some understanding of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of his grumpiness still drips off the page. "Don't bore your friends with photos that would bore you if they weren't your own," he wrote. "If you're shooting the sunrise over Bar Harbor, Maine, don't try to include your half-asleep spouse." Sarcasm was a second language for Grandpa, but I remember he seemed sincerely frustrated at how his peers didn't understand the basics of photography, equaled only by his frustration of how they were intimidated by computers.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Photography Week, I revisited his guide and thought about how he was trying to teach fellow retirees better ways to take shots. They're good tips—ones I still think about when having fun in a photo mode like the ones in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're so good, in fact, that they could help you make a better photo mode for your next game. Let's run through them and think about how they could make for better photo modes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?">Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One purpose, on purpose," is one of the first tips Grandpa Cohan wrote. "Think for just a few seconds about the purpose of the photo you're about to take. Compose in your mind before you compose in the viewfinder."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most modern games look so great just grabbing a screenshot of a moment in combat will catch the eye. When players open photo mode, they're committing to going a step further, maybe with a purpose in mind—but maybe not. Maybe they know there's a good shot here, but they don't know what it is yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most helpful tool I've seen here are the poses and facial expressions found in the most recent games from Sony's first-party studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Sony Santa Monica, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac Games all built tools that let players customize character poses and facial expressions. These can help players pick that "purpose." Should it be goofy, with Aloy doing a silly pose as a Thunderjaw rears at her? Or should it look like a comic panel, with Spider-Man's eyes going big and bug-eyed as he takes a punch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He was always fixated on what should go in a frame. Photo modes have done a great job on this front, offering players guides to match "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://photographylife.com/the-rule-of-thirds">the rule of thirds</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." "Do not center the subject," he wrote, the emphasis so strong I can hear him saying it years later. He wanted amateur photographers to learn not to "vertically center" the horizon in landscape shots, making sure the photo was one-third sky and two-third ground, or vice versa.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan. First printed in Outlook by the Bay.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quickly shooting multiple angles was another trick up his sleeve, promising readers they'd be "glad" they took "at least four shots" of a scene from different angles. Here he could introduce the idea of how photos looked different at a 45-degree angle, or how they'd look from the ground-up or from overhead. Ubisoft's got a feature that makes this easy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, letting players set a "Camera A" and "Camera B" to flip between. I wonder if photo modes would benefit from creating Cameras C and D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't agree with his advice that should avoid "candid camera" shots. "When shooting a party, don't try to be a photojournalist or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Funt">Allen Funt</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shooting surreptitiously," he wrote. Sometimes it's just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to snap and move on....is that true in games too?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Could photo modes get more ambitious, and have ways to preserve camera settings that players could trigger at flick of a button? Could you make it so players can pre-set an angle, lens type, and focal distance for "Camera A," and press a key to have it ready to shoot a photo of the player character in an instant. We have "instant replay" modes that grab video from players at camera angles they don't normally play in after all...</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty to think about in helping players set up a shot.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-shipped-61-7-million-units-xbox-series-sold-28-3-ww-as-of-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the rocky economy of both Xbox and PlayStation, PlayStation consistently comes out on top. Even since the PlayStation 2 came out, it has always been ahead of the curve. However, the gap closed between the PS3 and Xbox 360, with the PS3 coming out by 7.5 million units. Skipping to the present day, the PlayStation 5 has sold a <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/aldora-intelligence-ps5-61-7m-xbs-28-3m-shipments-end-of-june-2024.3005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly higher amount of units</a>, with a number of 61.7 million units being sold compared to the Xbox Series X|S, which has only sold 28.3 million units as of June 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a video released by WSJ on YouTube, they did a deep dive into why the Xbox has failed in the market, specifically the Xbox Series X|S. To some, it may come as a surprise, as Microsoft constantly reminded people in their advertising that the Xbox Series X was the most powerful console they'd ever made. Yet, it still just didn't have enough benefits to warrant buying. At least with PlayStation, there are exclusives, with some making their way to PC. Xbox hasn't had any exclusive games in a while. Xbox was needed to play games like Halo and Gears of War. However, the launch of their subscription service meant that you no longer needed a console for that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Lost the Console War. Now It’s Redefining Gaming. | WSJ The Economics Of" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuZtbsSrdwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multiple reports and data have suggested that they have definitively lost the console war to PlayStation and even the Nintendo Switch. Therefore, they are now shifting their focus onto the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Xbox Game Pass subscription service</a> to try and funnel money back into Microsoft and their gaming sector.</p>
<p>As stated in the video, when consoles were first introduced to the gaming industry and players, they were often sold as cheaply as possible. This means the companies were selling them at a loss to try to entice people into gaming and become frequent customers. For Xbox, they lose $200 per console. Even though Xbox is the main focus of this video, it can't be forgotten that PlayStation has also been struggling financially as of late. So much so that the original PlayStation 5 has seen price increases in multiple parts of the world. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">Japan saw a $90 increase</a> in both console versions, and the US saw a $5 increase in the Dualshock controllers.</p>
<p>Then, Sony announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. Immediately, fans were unhappy. Not only was the price extortionate for what it is, but the features it came with didn't make the console feel worthwhile. On top of that, those who want a physical game collection will have to fork out an extra sum of money to purchase a disk drive and the console's stand.</p>
<p>PlayStation may be on top, with 61.7 million units sold worldwide as of June 2024. Still, with their recent decisions regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro, it's becoming increasingly likely that they won't see as many sales as previous consoles they've made. It's already affected the market, as people in Japan are suddenly flocking to buy an<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-sales-increase-japan/"> Xbox Series console</a> rather than fork out for the PlayStation 5 pro. It may be possible that Nintendo will come out on top when they announce the successor of the Nintendo Switch.</p>

Widowmaker’s is based on antagonist Sylvanas Windrunner, who was an original inspiration for the sniper during <em>Overwatch</em>’s early development. While she’s shown with a bow similar to the one wielded by the <em>Warcraft </em>character in the new highlight intro released as part of the event, she still wields a rifle during regular gameplay. The bow also goes away if you use the highlight intro with any skin other than the Sylvanas one. Reinhardt, meanwhile, dons blue armor in tribute to the Lich King, the undead villain of the <em>Wrath of the Lich King </em>expansion. Zenyatta has one of the more surprising skins, as he takes on the visage of the orc Thrall instead of anything that would be more immediately compatible with his synthetic monk aesthetic. Props to Blizzard for thinking outside the box on that one. Lastly, Torbjörn takes on the diamond form of King Magni Bronzebeard.</p><p>If you’re a <em>Warcraft </em>diehard, the skins are pretty great, but like those in previous <em>Overwatch 2</em> collaboration events, they are expensive. The bundles are purchased with in-game currency, which is obtainable through the battle pass. However, you’ll most likely have to use some real money to reach the necessary amount, as the battle pass doesn’t give you enough coins to purchase any of the bundles:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Warcraft Mega Bundle: 5700</li><li>Sylvanas Widowmaker 2600</li><li>Lich King Reinhardt 2600 </li><li>Thrall Zenyatta 2500</li><li>Diamond Magni Torbjörn 2400</li></ul><p>If you’re just interested in the skins themselves and not the other cosmetics, you can buy them for slightly cheaper through the Heroes menu. You can click through to see more of each skin.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
