            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-exploration-deep-dive-devs-say-the-game-wont-hold-your-hand-too-much/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new delay</a>, Ubisoft is throwing Assassin's Creed Shadows fans a bone in the way of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new deep dive</a> into the exploration part of the game. Game Director Charles Benoit reckons the studio won't hold the player's hand too much, unlike previous installments in the franchise:</p>
<p><em>We didn't want to hold the player's hand too much with icons and markers. We wanted to craft an open world where information was key and would become a form of reward. This made sense in the context of playing a shinobi and fighting for information. In Assassin's Creed Shadows, information is something you need to look for and earn, whether through your spies, NPC encounters, or through your own eyes. In short, we want players to discover all our cool secrets on their own terms through investigation, their spy network, or by observing the world. When exploring the world, you should look out for undiscovered locations (i.e. "?" icons), because there are so many interesting places to seek out, whether in a destroyed camp or a hidden shrine, we want you to always feel a sense of discovery.</em></p>
<p>Players will still climb to high places, the so-called Viewpoints. However, rather than revealing vast amounts of the map, they'll only uncover nearby interests after tagging them through the new observe mechanic (which does not include any companion Eagle, this time around). Each Viewpoint still unlocks a Fast Travel Point, but some are located in the heart of locations filled with enemies, so fast traveling there may not necessarily be a good idea.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Vantage Point" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnUlfHRHt7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While exploring each region, safehouses called "Kakurega" will become available for players to purchase. They become small extensions of the Hideout (the central, fully customizable home base) and offer some of its more practical functions, such as restocking rations/tools/ammunition, accessing gear stash, managing and accepting contracts, restocking scouts, and managing which allies can be called for help. Kakuregas also have Fast Travel Points of their own, and unlike the Viewpoints detailed above, they're always safe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in Assassin's Creed Shadows, several of Japan's mountains won't be climbable due to their steepness. Due to this, Ubisoft warns players may sometimes be better off simply following roads, while supposed shortcuts may turn out to be unhelpful. If you get lost, though, there's a new toggleable Pathfinder feature that draws a white line overlay to highlight the best path to the objective, provided a quest is tracked and its location has been revealed to the protagonists by a scout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Pathfinder" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The quest log in Assassin's Creed Shadows is called Objective Board, which Ubisoft says will be key in investigating and locating the assassination targets. Zooming in on a specific target will reveal Opportunities - quest steps that can be individually selected and tracked.</p>
<p>Players are provided with clues as to the location of each opportunity, and they have to deduce where to investigate or go next by connecting the clues to your map.&nbsp;For those who prefer to have clear quest markers, deploying Scouts in the general area indicated by these clues will make things easier.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Target Board" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faWrGLgBBAc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout Assassin's Creed Shadows, the protagonists will be joined by various Scout NPCs who will help them locate quest objectives, gather resources to upgrade the Hideout base, and even cover their tracks by resetting Provincial alerts.</p>
<p>Deploying Scouts lets players scan ahead and reveal a more accurate location for their quest objectives. The more scouts are deployed at once, the greater the scouting radius, increasing the chances of actually finding the target. This is also particularly useful if you have not collected all the clues to reveal your objective, as they can help fill in the gaps in your knowledge. Once deployed, Scouts return at the end of the season and become available again. However, players can choose to pay some in-game currency to a Kakurega to speed up their return to the base.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Scouts" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ozpTwqHtXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Scouts are also useful to loot the various resource caches of the Wealthy clans, which are simply too large to be carried by a single person. Instead, you'll mark them with a flag to be smuggled out over time by the Scouts. At the end of the season, all flagged stockpiles will be cashed in to upgrade your hideout.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exploration: Smuggling" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SIc5hfp0J9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is out on March 20 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

Even better, they sync with Ubisoft Connect, so if you played the game years ago and unlocked all the challenges, you should be able to load up <em>Far Cry 3</em> today on Steam and get all your achievements.

Removing them was the right call.

                <p>Since its debut in 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/genshin-impact-review-%E2%80%93-direct-hit/1900-6417583/" data-ref-id="1900-6417583">Genshin Impact</a> has done a very good job of convincing players to purchase in-game items and currency with real-world money. Now, Genshin Impact's parent company, HoYoverse, may have to send some of that money back to players following a settlement with Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/ftc-nears-settlement-over-loot-boxes-in-popular-video-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the FTC is near the end of negotiations with HoYoverse to settle a case that began last summer over Genshin Impact's loot box-like currency system. The terms of the deal haven't been disclosed yet, but it's likely going to include a rebate of some amount to players who heavily invested their money into the game.</p><p>Genshin Impact doesn't have a traditional loot box system. Instead, it utilizes a complex Gacha system that allows players to convert real money into in-game currency, which must then be converted again into another currency before players can "wish" for a specific character or rare item. However, there are no guarantees that the wish will be successful, and this system has drawn comparisons to online gambling.</p><p>It's unclear if the settlement with the FTC will also compel HoYoverse to rethink Genshin Impact's approach to in-game currency and wishes. The United Kingdom's government <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uk-government-wont-enact-laws-on-loot-boxes-says-industry-should-self-police/1100-6505562/" data-ref-id="1100-6505562">has declined to create laws against loot boxes</a>, and instead wants the video game industry to police itself.</p><p>Blizzard's Hearthstone was one of the first games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hearthstone-helped-popularize-loot-boxes-then-weathered-the-backlash/1100-6521767/" data-ref-id="1100-6521767">to popularize randomized loot boxes</a>, and one of the first to face a backlash from players over it.

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal</a> was about as unremarkable as you could imagine for a new console generation reveal. It‚Äôs like the Nintendo Switch, a little bit bigger, a little bit‚Ä¶ snappier, there‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">a Mario Kart on screen</a>, and that‚Äôs about it. For a company that‚Äôs so often been about spiritual successors that experiment and play with confounding new ideas, this is a direct sequel that slaps a 2 on the end.</p>
<p>Nintendo played it safe, in other words, and that‚Äôs exactly what they needed to do.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 ‚Äì First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As popular and enduring as Nintendo has been, the company has always had a tendency to be a bit boom and bust. From the highs of the SNES, the Wii, you had the lows of the N64, GameCube and the Wii U, all of which were unable to keep pace with the dominant consoles of their era for one reason or another. The saving grace for Nintendo‚Äôs bank balance was that they always had great success with their handhelds. Sure, the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo 3DS were a step down from the industry-altering hits of the Game Boy and Nintendo DS, but the GBA sold over 80 million and the 3DS eventually passed 75 million and I can think of a console manufacturer that would bite your hand off to have those sales figures.</p>
<p>Nintendo don‚Äôt have that lifeline anymore, with the Nintendo Switch having become their all-in-one handheld and TV console. This was a genius move back in 2017, consolidating both their audiences, and letting them unite all their development teams around a single platform, but now they‚Äôre faced with having to make a new console generation with much less room for mistakes.</p>

<p>So the Nintendo Switch 2 keeps it simple. The reveal trailer shows a console that is built around the same fundamental principles, a hybrid console with detachable controllers that you can play handheld, docked, or as a tabletop screen. But it also showed key areas of improvement.</p>
<div id="attachment_456087"><p id="caption-attachment-456087">The Nintendo Switch 2 looks familiar, but a new Mario Kart is long overdue ‚Äì&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>A slightly bigger screen follows the trend set out by PC handhelds like the Steam Deck (and the Switch OLED as well), and the focus on the revised Joy-Con also hints at Nintendo addressing weaknesses of their hardware design from the original. The fixed rails are now a snap-in system ‚Äì&nbsp;probably relying on magnets&nbsp;‚Äì that will hopefully be stronger and less creaky, there‚Äôs bigger buttons embedded there to make them more usable, and we‚Äôll have to hope that it‚Äôs also got some improvements to remove the risk of analogue stick drift.</p>
<p>Most important of all, though, Nintendo kept it simple with the name as well. After the Wii U and 3DS (and the ‚ÄúNew Nintendo 3DS‚Äù) seemed to confuse the average consumer with their naming, branding this the Nintendo Switch 2 makes it abundantly clear that this is a new console. Sure, there‚Äôs the possibility of cross-gen games, but gamers as a whole are familiar and comfortable with those ideas. They definitely know what backward compatibility is, and putting up a screen to say that (almost) all Switch games are compatible was as clear as could be.</p>
<div id="attachment_456147"><p id="caption-attachment-456147">The Joy-Con redesign for Nintendo Switch 2 ‚Äì&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>There‚Äôs also room for a few surprises still‚Ä¶ were it not for the fact that so much about this console has already been rumoured and leaked. People very quickly spotted what look to be optical sensors in the Joy-Con connectors, and the animation of Joy-Con skating around with wrist-straps looking like mouse tails certainly suggest that the rumours of a computer mouse input style could be supported.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs an intriguing idea, but it‚Äôs a small quirk alongside a console that looks thoroughly familiar. And for some that‚Äôs disappointing. Where‚Äôs the wild experiments of three-pronged controllers, waggle controls or multiple screens? Where‚Äôs the new ideas?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think we‚Äôre maybe past that point in terms of gaming hardware. The Nintendo Switch was in many ways the Ur-console for Nintendo. It built in the motion sensors for the Joy-Con, it allows for both handheld and TV play, and even used the IR sensor for heart rate measurements and rudimentary shape viewing. The only things it truly missed from Nintendo‚Äôs console idea archives were a 3D screen and dual screen features.</p>
<p>And by having everything built in with a decently powerful console, Nintendo were still able to explore all of those ideas in their typically quirky style. We had the Nintendo Labo cardboard accessories, we had Ring Fit, we had Dr Kawashima‚Äôs Brain Training come back, and plenty more besides, and in this age of metrics and analytics, Nintendo will &nbsp;have been able to see exactly what works, what sold, what was actually used. Needless to say, I don‚Äôt think Labo is making a comeback, but Ring Fit definitely could, even if it loses the heart rate tracking element.</p>
<div id="attachment_345125"><p id="caption-attachment-345125">Ring Fit could have compatibility issues with Switch 2, but the core idea is one that‚Äôs worthy of a sequel ‚Äì&nbsp;image credit: Nintendo</p></div>
<p>Ultimately, the thing that worked best on Nintendo Switch was Mario Kart 8. The Switch has sold a whopping 146 million units, and not that far off half of those consoles have been accompanied by a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (64 million copies sold, not including Wii U sales). It is the single best-selling platform exclusive game, which is just incredible.</p>
<p>No wonder Nintendo teased the next Mario Kart during the Switch 2‚Äôs reveal. It‚Äôs familiar, it‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs easy to understand. It‚Äôs going to sell like hot cakes.</p>

<h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;<b>Kill Team 3rd Edition</b></h2>

<p>The latest version of the Warhammer 40K skirmish wargame streamlined a lot of rules (and got rid of the crazy shapes for measuring), and while the 2nd edition was great, this edition feels more polished and I love the addition of the free faction rules online, letting you build your force out of your existing models without any other purchase. It also introduced a great cooperative/solo mode (at the cost of the narrative campaign play, which we hope they bring back).</p>

<h2><b>Fourth Place - The Magnus Archives Roleplaying Game</b></h2>



<p><em>Written by Tyler Chancey</em></p>

<p>This year, Monte Cook Games managed two impressive tasks. Adapting the cult horror podcast series The Magnus Archives into a fun, atmospheric TTRPG. Second, through that adaptation introduce a compelling mental Stress system and with it a layer of cosmic horror into the award-winning Cypher System. Truly a wonder to behold.</p>



<h2><b>Third Place - The Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=pNlkit7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-lord-of-the-rings-duel.jpg?itok=MI9Mg8Ca 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p>When you give the elevator pitch of this game (a LOTR reskinning of <i>7 Wonders: Duel</i>, which is itself a 2-player version of&nbsp;<em>7 Wonders</em>) you'd be excused for thinking this is just a cash grab using a strong IP. But you'd be more wrong than Boromir suggesting one cannot simply walk into Mordor! With a tense back and forth, fun mechanics built around building a card tableau, and multiple routes to victory (including map control, points, and more),&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth</em>&nbsp;was one of the most surprising gaming experiences we've had this year!</p>

<h2><b>Second Place - HeroQuest First Light</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=nW8P3jKt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-heroquest-first-light.jpeg?itok=xtO-3CEZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Andrew Stretch</em></p>

<p>For families wanting to begin to broach more complicated TTRPGs with young family members HeroQuest First Light is an all-in-one box that will have them dungeon diving in no time. With a versatile game board that can be explored nearly infinite ways, and quick to grasp but satisfying combat, it becomes a bridge between a traditional board game and a pen and paper RPG. An added benefit is the GM Companion App that will allow for a party of four to explore without needing a GM lowering the barrier to entry even further.</p>

<h2><b>First Place - Wyrmspan</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=BQua3WM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tabletop-game-of-the-year-wyrmspan.jpeg?itok=N-HrbQ6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Written by Giaco Furino</em></p>

<p><em>Wyrmspan</em>&nbsp;is a game that takes something incredible and perfects upon it further, pushing the design right up to the limits to create a bold, inviting, and strategically rewarding experience. I think&nbsp;<em>Wyrmspan&nbsp;</em>may be one of the most engrossing gaming experiences I've had this year, and fans of the original&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>&nbsp;absolutely need to check this game out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Even if the birding aspect is what initially drew you into&nbsp;<em>Wingspan</em>, rest assured that this game - full of its own swath of gorgeous illustrations - will completely sink its talons into you and your gaming group!</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> continues to evolve over a year and a half after release, having seen major changes to its endgame, difficulty, and even items. Now, as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Diablo 4 Season 7, Season of Witchcraft</a>, Blizzard is adding another permanent game-changing feature to its ARPG--the Armory.</p><p dir="ltr">What the Armory does is simple: It lets players save up to five different loadouts per character. With the click of a button, players can swap out the entirety of their equipped gear, but more importantly, also their skill points and paragon points. Once a loadout is saved, characters can freely swap to it at no charge, giving easy access to up to five different builds and encouraging players to experiment and try new strategies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Kc7LjVwa8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R4Kc7LjVwa8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The Armory is in many ways the culmination of how Blizzard's mindset has changed in the time since Diablo 4 launched. Whereas once respeccing skill points and Paragon Boards (or even re-rolling item affixes at the Enchanter) came with a hefty gold cost, those costs have gotten less prohibitive over time. Now, with the Armory, players can completely swap out almost every major choice for their character and flip builds as often as they want, without having to pay any kind of fee.</span></p><p dir="ltr">It may seem like an obvious addition, but it's a bigger deal than it at first seems, and one that will no doubt lead to more creative builds. To learn more and discuss the kind of paradigm shift the Armory represents, GameSpot chatted with Diablo 4 design director Dan Tanguay and game designer Sean White about how Blizzard's stance on a feature like the Armory has changed. Along the way we touched on other Season 7 additions, like how the team decided on its numerous Witch Doctor-inspired powers and the chances of Diablo 4 getting an entire Witch-themed class in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When Diablo 4 launched and began to transition into the live-service game we know today, Tanguay said some aspects of the game didn't line up with what players wanted. That led to Blizzard taking a hard look at player feedback and implementing changes like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Season 4's Loot Reborn update</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/">major difficulty revamp as part of Season 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Next on the player feedback list--the addition of the Armory. Despite the feature appearing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/">Diablo 3</a> and Blizzard's mobile spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, Tanguay said the decision to add the Armory to Diablo 4 wasn't so simple. He said because Diablo 4 was a mix of both returning franchise players as well as new ones, the team first needed time to learn what players wanted from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429538" data-ratio="0.56246648793566" data-width="1865" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429538"></a><figcaption>The Armory allows characters to save up to five loadouts at once.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429538-diablo4thearmory.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, the team had a strong desire to "make choices matter," according to White. But over time, the game added more and more choices for players but didn't give them more tools to experiment. That led to Blizzard having to make a choice about what direction it wanted its ARPG to go in, Tanguay said.</p><p dir="ltr">"Do we want to encourage that kind of experimentation or do we want to really say you have to start over again in order to do this experimentation, or at the very least pay a cost that you have to spend some time investing in, and put barriers in front of that experimentation?" Tanguay said. "Ultimately we decided, based on what we heard from players, was that we didn't want many barriers to experimentation. We found, even in later seasons, the more we encouraged players to experiment and the fewer barriers we had, they were even starting to make more and more alternate characters. Ultimately Diablo 4 and Diablo games in general have a wide variety of classes and builds within those classes, so it makes sense to try and encourage players to explore all that space much like you would explore the overworld of Sanctuary."</p><p dir="ltr">Though much of Diablo 4's live-service has been dedicated to its seasonal servers, the game's non-seasonal Eternal Realm looks to benefit from the addition of the Armory in a big way. There, players who dread creating a new character every few months can now easily experiment with new builds, without feeling like they have to start over.</p><p dir="ltr">"There is a strong contingent of Eternal players who really want to continue playing their character," Tanguay said. "The Armory very much appeals to them, because now they have their character and they can create variations on that character without any of the time pressures‚Ä¶with seasons."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429539" data-ratio="0.56235697940503" data-width="1748" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429539"></a><figcaption>Witchcraft Powers like the Poison Frog servant serve as a homage to Diablo 3's Witch Doctor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4429539-diablo4poisonfrogservant.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While the Armory will be a permanent addition going forward, the rest of the season revolves around players earning new Witchcraft powers to take their builds into overdrive. Many of those powers, like Piranhado, Poison Frog servant, and Soul Harvest, are inspired by the Witch Doctor class from Diablo 3. Once the team had decided on its approach when it came to depicting Diablo 4's "self-serving" swamp witches for the season's theme, bringing in some Witch Doctor flavor seemed like a natural fit, White said.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are parallels to Witch Doctor there which paved the way to 'Alright, we are kind of doing swamp witches, let's try to bring back some fan favorites from Diablo 3,'" White said. "I'm a big Witch Doctor fan. But at the same time, let's also try to put a cool spin on it and bring some new stuff that is still witch-themed but has never been seen before."</p><p dir="ltr">With no Witch Doctor in Diablo 4 and a whole new host of Witch-themed powers, it certainly seems like there is potential for a fully fleshed out Witch class--something ARPG rival <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/">Path of Exile 2</a> currently has. Tanguay wouldn't rule the idea out, and said ultimately if something is popular as part of a season, the team would find a way to make it a permanent addition in some shape or form.</p><p dir="ltr">"Right now our feeling is those powers are going to be season-only right now," Tanguay said. "We may incorporate some new ones of them down the road like how we brought some of the powers back as items in previous seasons, but that does then is leave that door open to say, 'You know what, Season of Witchcraft was great for exploring what witchcraft might be, but down the road, maybe we could have a class that's like that.' Not saying we're going to have one, [but] we've just left that door open. It's important for us, especially as a live service, to make sure we're not closing too many doors so that we can continue that dialogue with players and understand what they want out of the game and be able to react to that."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 7 begins January 21.</p>

of the same rarity. Pokemon TCG Pocket features eight different card rarities, but not all rarities will be available to swap with friends. Only the card rarities with diamond 1-4 and the 1-star cards can be traded, meaning the super rare, immersive, and crown rarities are off the table.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement also vaguely mentioned some kind of cost for trading, saying "items must be consumed in order to trade." It's uncertain if this means players will need to spend Poke Gold or one of the other existing in-game currencies found in Pokemon TCG Pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">While some players might be disappointed that only specific cards from the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs can be traded at launch, there are plans to expand the selection of booster packs that can be traded from.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the next booster packs will also be added later this month, and the company says more details will be shared soon.</p>

Following yesterday's long-awaited Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo has started opening up registrations for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">previously announced public hands-on play sessions</a>, confirming that attendees will have up to four hours play tie with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 World Tour, as the company's calling the months-long event, runs from 4th April until sometime in June. It's set to visit 15 cities spanning four continents - Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia - in that time, starting with Paris and New York.
</p>
<p>
And for those eager to attend and check out Nintendo's new console, <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events">registrations are starting to go live</a>. Currently, registration is open for most European venues - Paris, London, Milan, Berlin - with other Madrid, Amsterdam, and venues in other territories to follow.

<p>
What's perhaps most notable is the length of time attendees can spend with Switch 2. Anyone looking to go hands-on must select a 60-minute arrival window when they register, but actual play sessions officially last four hours. In Europe, at least - details currently available for North American venues point to significantly shorter play sessions, lasting two and a half hours.
</p><p>
It's worth reiterating registration doesn't guarantee entry to Nintendo's hands-on events, as tickets will be assigned based on a randomly selected draw. You can, however, register as a group - provided everyone attending has a Nintendo Account linked to the same family group.
</p>
<p>
As to what'll be available to play during each session, Nintendo hasn't yet said - but it seems likely a new Mario Kart will be there given its prominence in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">this week's Switch 2 reveal</a>. We can expect more details on the console's launch line-up during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct on 2nd April</a>, but in the meantime, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know so far</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rog-ally-v-rog-ally-x-which-is-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Asus ROG Ally was considered the best gaming handheld device on the market ‚Äì until the ROG Ally X showed up. This next-generation variant of Asus‚Äô Windows 11 gaming handheld was released in July 2024, which means gamers worldwide have had more than half a year to fully get to grips (no pun intended) with the device.</p>



<p>I‚Äôm the proud owner of both the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X, and I figured it was about time I settled the comparison beef once and for all. Is the ROG Ally X worth the massive price increase over the ROG Ally, or are you better off sticking with the original and saving a few hundred dollars?</p>



<p>Let‚Äôs find it ‚Äì it‚Äôs time for ROG Ally v ROG Ally X ‚Äì the battle between the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-ally-x-worth-it">Is The ROG Ally X Worth It?</h2>



<p>The ROG Ally can be bought brand new for around $450 ‚Äì $600, depending on where you look. By comparison, the ROG Ally X costs up to $800, which is a considerable increase.</p>



<p>But is the extra power under the hood of the Asus ROG Ally X worth the jump?</p>



<p>I went straight from an Ally to an Ally X, and the difference was noticeable both in and outside the device. Internally, the ROG Ally X has 8 GB more RAM and a 1 TB SSD as standard, which beats the Ally‚Äôs 512 GB SSD into the ground. The biggest selling point of the Ally X is the battery ‚Äì while the Ally has a 40Wh battery, the Ally X boasts a beasty 80Wh battery.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the Ally X isn‚Äôt all that much bigger to account for the boosted hardware and capabilities ‚Äì it‚Äôs just 65 grams heavier than the Ally, which was released in 2023.</p>



<p>Both devices utilise the same screen and speakers, but the Ally X has an extra USB-C port and the micro SD card slot was relocated to counter an overheating issue that was present in the Ally ‚Äì <strong>and still is</strong>. That extra port means that you can run a USB-C headset on the device while charging it, which is a nice bonus.</p>



<p>Asus also reported that the Ally X has a better internal cooling solution, with fans that boast more blades.</p>



<p>On the surface, the ROG Ally X is quite different. The overall shape of the device has been rounded off in place, the default colour is black as opposed to white, the rear ‚Äòextra‚Äô buttons have been shrunken down, and the thumbsticks feel much more durable and tactile.</p>



<p>But is all that worth the price increase, or should you stick with the ROG Ally? I put both of these handheld gaming devices to the test.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-the-rog-ally-still-hold-up">Does The ROG Ally Still Hold Up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Ally X is the new king of handhelds</figcaption></figure>



<p>Until recently, the ROG Ally was my flagship handheld, and it was a trusty one at that. However, I did have a few issues</p>



<ul>
<li>On the ‚Äòturbo‚Äô mode (25W or 30W plugged in), the heat generated by the ROG Ally would be extreme after too long</li>



<li>Also on turbo, the battery life was laughably short, with a AAA game killing the battery in around 30 minutes</li>



<li>I was never a fan of the stark white colour for a handheld, as it‚Äôs bound to get dirty or discoloured</li>
</ul>



<p>It was fine for plane rides and commutes, but beyond that, I couldn‚Äôt sing its praises too much. It‚Äôs a Windows 11 device, just like the Ally X, but it‚Äôs not like I was using it for multitasking and web browsing ‚Äì the Windows interface just doesn‚Äôt translate well to a handheld device like this.</p>



<p>Once I switched to the ROG Ally X, the benefits were plain as day.</p>



<p>For example, I played Diablo 4 off-charge and on turbo mode, and I was able to coax around an hour and a half out of the battery before it collapsed in on itself. That‚Äôs more than enough to please me, but I was able to notice a performance boost too, thanks to the enhanced RAM in the Ally X.</p>



<p>The face buttons, shell, multi-directional d-pad, and even the shoulder buttons (which are more ‚Äòmouse-clicky‚Äô on the Ally X) all look and feel superb, and overall, the device is much more attractive in a black-on-black aesthetic. Also, the front-mounted speakers sound much more powerful. Having the volume on just ‚Äô20‚Äô is more than enough for me.</p>



<p>I have no gripes with the Ally X ‚Äì <strong>yet</strong>.</p>



<p>Is the Ally X worth the money, though? I‚Äôd say so ‚Äì but $800 is a severe price point for any gaming device, least of all a handheld with a relatively limited battery life and a UI that just isn‚Äôt comfortable when it comes to gaming.</p>



<p>I can see the improvement over the Ally, and that‚Äôs what I was going for. I would have liked an upgraded screen or a switch-up in the RGB on the device, but I‚Äôll take what I‚Äôve been given, I suppose. It‚Äôs still a nice 7-inch IPS display running at 120Hz.</p>



<p>While you can still get the Asus ROG Ally, I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth investing the cash if you‚Äôre not getting the best and most up-to-date available model on the market. Ultimately, it‚Äôs your decision.</p>

<p>Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports, the esports organization owned by content creator stars Charles ‚ÄúCr1TiKaL‚Äù White Jr. and Ludwig ‚ÄúLudwig‚Äù Ahgren, have fully merged under the Shopify banner. Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig are now co-owners of Shopify Rebellion.</p>



<p>The two organizations have partnered together in recent years, but now move forward together as one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-and-moist-esports-fully-join-forces">Shopify Rebellion and Moist Esports Fully Join Forces</h2>



<p>In addition to Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig joining Rebellion as co-owners, the organization will use some of Moist Esports‚Äô branding (including the droplet mascots) and absorb the esports divisions competing under the Moist banner. All the Moist divisions will compete as Shopify Rebellion moving forward.</p>







<p>Moist Esports was founded by Cr1TiKaL in 2021, with the YouTube star jumping into the expansive fighting game community (FGC) first before entering Rocket League and Apex Legends a year later. Ludwig joined Moist as a co-owner in 2023, spear-heading the organization‚Äôs entry into VALORANT. Later that year, Ludwig announced that Moist and Shopify would partner together to run a VALORANT NA Challengers roster, which competed under the name MxS.</p>



<p>Both Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig have been very forthcoming and public about the costs of running an esports organization. Back in 2021, Cr1TiKaL told his audience plainly that he was running Moist Esports at a loss. When the organization entered VALORANT, Ludwig said that entering the scene cost roughly <a href="https://dotesports.com/valorant/news/ludwig-spends-half-a-million-dollars-to-pick-up-na-valorant-challengers-roster-for-moist-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äú$500,000 of Charlie‚Äôs money.‚Äù</a></p>



<p>With Moist and Shopify Rebellion now merged, the Rebels now field several different esports rosters. ‚ÄúComing together allows us to field more and stronger teams, invest deeper for fans, and provide more to our players,‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/ShopifyRebels/status/1880287780817056025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote Shopify Rebellion founder</a>, Jeremy Steeves. Shopify Rebellion fields the following esports rosters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Two VALORANT teams (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the two-time defending Game Changers champions</a>)</li>



<li>A League of Legends roster in the newly rebranded LoL Americas conference (formerly in the LCS)</li>



<li>An Apex Legends roster</li>



<li>A Halo roster in the HCS</li>



<li>A Rainbow Six Siege roster (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-in-rainbow-six-soniqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed just this past December</a>)</li>



<li>A Dota 2 roster</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/six-invitational-2025-groups-confirmed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Between the 3rd and the 16th of February, the Six Invitational 2025 will unravel in Boston. This historic tournament is one of the biggest single events in the esports ecosystem, boasting a $3 million prize pool shared between 20 competing teams.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft took to social media to reveal the full suite of Six Invitational 2025 groups, uncovering four rosters each made up of five teams apiece. Judging from the lineup that has been revealed, we‚Äôre already set to see some stellar matches at the Six Invitational 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-line-them-up">Line Them Up</h2>



<p>Here are the Six Invitational 2025 groups per the recent release from Ubisoft:</p>



<p><strong>Group A</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>M80</li>



<li>Team JOEL</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>



<li>Unwanted</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group B</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>CAG Osaka</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>FURIA</li>



<li>Shopify Rebellion</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group C</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>DarkZero</li>



<li>PSG Talon</li>



<li>RazaH Company Academy</li>



<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Group D</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Oxygen Esports</li>



<li>SCARZ</li>



<li>Spacestation Gaming</li>



<li>Virtus.pro</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>By far the most exciting group at the Six Invitational is Group B, featuring the talents of FaZe Clan and FURIA. At the last Six Invitational in Sao Paolo, these two rosters went head-to-head in the grand final, which turned out to be the most popular esports event in Rainbow Six Siege history.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs already a fixture to watch out for.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, all eyes will be on Team BDS, sitting in Group C alongside challengers like DarkZero, Team Falcons, and PSG Talon. It was BDS that scooped a solid performance last year, netting the Esports World Cup trophy and finishing in second place at back-to-back BLAST Major tournaments. It‚Äôs easy to see how Team BDS could go all the way in Boston.</p>



<p>Following the group stage, the teams will be seeded into the Six Invitational 2025 playoff stage. From there, it‚Äôs a fight through the double-elimination bracket to the grand final, with the lion‚Äôs share of the $3 million prize pool waiting for the victor.</p>



<p>Who do you see winning the Six Invitational 2025? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has said he would have tried to resist Sony‚Äôs controversial live service video game push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida, who was President of SIE Worldwide Studios for Sony Interactive Entertainment from 2008 to 2019, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinda Funny Games</a> that Sony always knew its investment in live service games was risky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida‚Äôs comments come amid a tumultuous time for PlayStation live service games. While Arrowhead‚Äôs Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony‚Äôs other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony‚Äôs Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has proved a costly failure for Sony. Concord's initial development deal was around $200 million according to a report by <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a>. It said the $200 million was not enough to fund Concord's entire development, nor did it include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog‚Äôs The Last of Us multiplayer game. And just this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida, who left Sony this week after 31 years at the company, discussed PlayStation live service in the interview with Kinda Funny Games, saying if he were current Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst, he would have pushed back on live service back when it emerged. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúFor me, I was managing this budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make,‚Äù Yoshida said. ‚ÄúIf the company was considering [going] that way, it probably didn‚Äôt make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into the live service games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúHowever, what they did when I left and Hermen [Hulst] took over is the company gave us a lot more resources. I don‚Äôt think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. [They said] ‚Äòthese games are great, keep doing that, and we‚Äôll give you additional resources to work on these live service games and try it.‚Äô</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they knew it was risky. The chance of a game becoming successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that‚Äôs the way they did it. In my mind, that‚Äôs great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúLuckily, Helldivers 2 did so well. Nobody expected that. So you can‚Äôt plan a success in this industry. That‚Äôs the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end. If I was in Hermen‚Äôs position, probably I would‚Äôve tried to resist that direction. Maybe that‚Äôs one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party!‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company had learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year and Concord‚Äôs failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation ‚Äúmuch earlier than we did.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúCurrently we are still in the process of learning,‚Äù Totoki admitted. ‚ÄúBasically, with regards to new IP, of course you don‚Äôt know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki was that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord‚Äôs issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony‚Äôs ‚Äúsiloed organization‚Äù and Concord‚Äôs release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,‚Äù Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúAnd then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe launched two live service games this year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHelldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games ‚Äî which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP ‚Äî with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie‚Äôs Marathon, Guerrilla‚Äôs Horizon Online, and Haven Studio‚Äôs Fairgame$.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>This measurement method requires some judgment calls to decide where the edges of certain Switch 2 elements begin and end in the relevant frames. Issues of distortion associated with the camera lens (or video editing on Nintendo's part) might also affect the precision of the measurements. Still, the results of this calculation should be close enough for a first-order estimate.</p>
<p>Overall, the Switch's expanded screen size would give it something of a leg up over portable PC competition like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">Steam Deck</a> (or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck OLED</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">ROG Ally X</a>. To get a significantly <em>bigger</em> screen on a gaming handheld, you have to look to <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/outletus/en/p/handheld/legion-go/len106g0001">the Lenovo Legion Go</a> or monsters like the upcoming <a href="https://www.acer.com/us-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11">Acer Nitro Blaze 11</a>. Yet despite the larger screen, the Switch 2 still comes in significantly narrower than competition like the Steam Deck (10.48-inch width with Joy-Cons for the Switch 2 versus 11.7 inches for the Steam Deck).</p>


<p>As for the new Joy-Cons, a lengthening of roughly 13 to 18 percent along either axis should make holding them a little less cramp-inducing for adult hands. And the additional surface area on the joysticks (~43 percent larger) and buttons (~60 percent larger) should make them significantly more comfortable under the thumbs.</p>
<p>We won't really know how the comparative hardware battle will shake out, though, until we get crucial details from Nintendo about things like the Switch 2's thickness, weight, screen resolution, and hardware power (not to mention the price, of course). For now, though, at least we can look at these images and measurements and imagine how the next Nintendo console will feel in our hands.</p>
<h2>Switch 2 estimated dimensions</h2>
