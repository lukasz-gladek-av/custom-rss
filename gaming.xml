<p>Compatible with Switch 1 and Switch 2, it looks pretty familiar to the Pro 2 – why fix what isn't broken 'n' all that – but comes with a wealth of features that will hopefully justify the $69.99 price tag.</p>
<p>First up, we've got swappable ABXY buttons, so if you're keen to remap inputs for certain titles, then this should prove pretty useful. The Pro 3 also comes with its own charging dock, TMR analogue sticks, L4 and R4 bumpers, two back paddles, rumble support, gyro support, and hall effect triggers. Wowza!</p>
<p>It's currently available for pre-order via the official website and Amazon, with shipping estimated to begin on <strong>12th August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a look at all features for the Pro 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TMR Joystick<br>
- Extra bumpers (R4 and L4)<br>
- 2 Pro back paddle buttons<br>
- Trigger mode switch<br>
- Hall effect triggers<br>
- Tactile D-pad<br>
- Swappable magnetic ABXY buttons<br>
- 6-axis motion control (for Switch and Steam only)<br>
- Turbo function<br>
- Vibration<br>
- Support 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-wick-hex-is-being-delisted-this-week-on-all-platforms.1244109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/interviewing-mike-bithell-ygf/">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted this week, publisher Big Fan Games has announced. It'll be entirely removed from sale on all digital platforms as of <strong>July 17, 2025</strong>. If you've already bought the game, you'll be able to continue playing it and redownload it, but if not, you'll miss out on your chance to get the game, seemingly forever. </p>



<p>The news was announced quite suddenly this week, giving players only days to decide whether they wanted to grab it before its gone, or let it pass them by for good. John Wick Hex is critically acclaimed as one of the best games based on a film or TV show in some time, including by Wccftech, who called it "<em>an action choreography masterclass</em>" when <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/">we reviewed it back when it launched in October 2019 on PC</a>. It was out on consoles a year later, in December 2020.</p>



<p>"<em>John Wick Hex will be removed from sale on all platforms beginning July 17th, 2025,</em>" a statement on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675?l=english">Steam page</a> began. "<em>After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Consoles) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront</em>." No reason for the delisting has been given.</p>



<p>With the game being removed in just two days at the time of this writing, that puts its shelf life at less than six years since its release, a short lifetime even for a game based on a licensed series. If anything, it's a wonder why there haven't been more John Wick games, since the release of John Wick Hex was such a critical success. The films have also only grown in success and popularity in the last six years, and with all the collaboration between the video game industry and Hollywood of late, you'd think someone would have been working on making another John Wick game happen.</p>



<p>"<em>When all is said and done, John Wick Hex is an exceptional licensed game, and a wonderful strategic shooter even away from that,</em>" our review reads. "<em>It's the kind of game that's high quality and enjoyable, even if you are clueless about the John Wick movies themselves. The perfect kind of licensed game, that works as well as an introduction to the franchise as it does as an extension of it. Absolutely worth playing</em>."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-5-is-%E2%80%9Cfully-greenlit%E2%80%9D-according-to-a-new-report.1244106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that Starfield has come and gone, the next major title Bethesda fans are waiting for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. After that, it'll be time for Fallout 5 to finally take center stage in the theatre of Bethesda's development efforts. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/">That's been the plan</a>, according to Bethesda and Todd Howard, who, at this point, will likely finish his career with the release of Fallout 5, considering how long modern video games take to make. According to Windows Central reporter Jez Corden, speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DDr2ZSFIEXk?t=3845s">XB2 podcast</a>, the first major step in making Fallout 5 a reality has been taken, as the game is now "<em>fully greenlit."</em></p>



<p>That said, there's not a lot of clarity as to who is leading the project. According to Corden, a significant number of Bethesda's developers are working on more DLC for Starfield. The remaining staff are full-steam-ahead on The Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout 5 might have been officially added to the docket, but when it enters full production, and who will even be leading the way, isn't entirely clear.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Howard and his team are the obvious guess, but who knows what Bethesda and Microsoft will look like by the time Fallout 5 is ready to be the full focus of the studio. For now, despite claims that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">Fallout 5 might be moved up the priority list thanks to the success of the TV show</a>, it seems like it'll be a number of years before Fallout 5 is out and on shelves.</p>

<p>Phew. That was close. Although I fear your face will never quite be the same again. A tremendous loss for faces, but a possible gain for anyone curious what Obsidian were up to in 2006. Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3.5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a> - Enhanced Edition is out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">Steam</a>, although you have just missed the 10% discount for being a faithless worm and not pre-ordering. Soak in the shame of your minor monetary penalty, worm. That'll learn you to take a publisher's word for it next time. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>The new edition boasts "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support with a newly designed controller-specific UI." There's obviously a bit of vagueness here, and as far as I can tell Aspyr haven't gone into detail for e.g what "polished mechanics" actually means. Although Aspyr's Jordan Reese did share the following with <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-interview/">Nintendo Everything</a> recently, via <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/50714-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-dev-details-improvements-to-graphics-and">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We’ve made several overall gameplay enhancements, many of which are noticeable as soon as you boot the game such as graphical overhauls and UI/UX redesigns, while others like updating the game client to a 64-bit architecture, and networking infrastructure are a little more behind the scenes to support modern hardware."</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, again, isn't a tonne to go on, although Reese also confirmed that you'll be able to switch to the "classic UI and control scheme". The edition also includes all three of the original's expansions, plus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> and mod support. Although, again no explicit confirmation on whether old mods will work. Sensing a pattern here. Fingers crossed, since it's become a bit of a favourite for modders over the years. You can even play the entire <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 1 campaign inside of it, in case you want to confirm that Larian didn't Flanderise Minsc - he was genuinely always like that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-hottest-dungeons-dragons-rpg-of-2006-is-out-now-in-ostensibly-enhanced-form]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bless me, An-Ansgaidh, for I have sinned. Not against the Herald of Annihilation. Never against my god. I have always carried out my duties, my service, faithfully. Like any good cultist in An-Ansgaidh’s service, I long to be free from the burden of flesh, the toil of our mortal existence. Being a writer is a life of confessions. Every drop of ink I put to page reveals a bit of myself, whether I want it to or not. But now I have the honor of spilling blood in the service of a great god in this Pikmin-esque cult builder. And I am enjoying myself, but I feel kinda bad about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo of Worship puts me in the robe of a cult leader sworn to An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, the most compassionate of the Unseen Depth gods, who is determined to end our suffering by bringing an end to our pointless existence. Sick. My job is to gain An-Ansgaidh’s favor and expand Its cult. After playing a brief tutorial that gives me an overview of the controls and introduces me to a sassy and utterly deranged (in its own words, “charming a witty”) talking grimoire that serves as my guide, I’m dropped into a run in An-Ansgaidh’s service.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Worship Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t start with any cultists in my service, which is a bad look for a cult leader. Luckily, An-Ansgaidh starts me with some godless who just needs something to believe in. How do I convert them, you ask? I stab myself with a dagger and smear my blood across the ground to create sacred symbols. This whole thing is a ritual, you know. A circle to draw the godless within it to our cult. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. A square to summon the Execution Edict, a fraction of my god’s power so Its mighty hand might judge our enemies, and find them wanting. I press my hand to the blood-stained ground to activate its power. It awaits my command. I am patient. I am powerful.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But it does hurt to stab myself so much. I fret not over my hand (which is probably little more than a bloody pulp) but for my mortality. To drain my lifeblood across the ground for An-Ansgaidh is an honor, but it leaves me diminished, leaves me at the mercy of my enemies. All that to say: it literally drains my health, and I want to be freed from this mortal coil but in An-Ansgaidh’s time, not our enemies’. And we have so many enemies. The godless stand mute, unmoving, uncomprehending. They pose no threat. Converting them to our unholy cause is simple as surrounding them with a circle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But I fear the others. No conversion will take hold of them. The behatted men with their rapiers that cut down my cultists like so much kindling, the black creatures who do not serve my god and spew bile at us. Once there are enough of us, they pose no threat. I raise my hand, mark what needs to die, and my cult descends upon them like locusts. I wonder if An-Ansgaidh, Herald of Annihilation, is a Pikmin fan. Probably not. Gods are not concerned with such trivial things as the Nintendo GameCube. But it reminds me of it all the same.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not to say our followers don’t die. Oh, they are resilient. They fall, dizzied, stars swirling about their heads, but they often rise before they are killed. But inevitably, some die, brought low before they can rise and recover. Early on in our ventures, I learned to avoid our enemies. I searched instead for the godless, converted them to our cult. It is only when I have overwhelming numbers that I challenge our foes, and they fall before An-Ansgaidh’s glory. Sometimes my followers perish. That is inevitable. But I try to keep them alive. A good cult is a strong cult, and a strong cult is made of many bodies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They are pliable. I can pick them up by the throat and throw them to ring bells, or gut them and use their blood to perform rituals instead of my own. I have no problem throwing them at things. They’ll be a little concussed, maybe. But they’ll live. Once you use them as a resource, though, it’s lights out. Curtains. Game over. I don’t like killing the cultists. Partially because it leaves me with one less cultist, making my unholy army a little weaker. But partly because it doesn’t feel right. I brought them into this. It’s my job to keep them safe. They’re my children (religiously speaking) and my children (metaphorically speaking). They follow me around like little dogs. Besides, there’s no shortage of blood for me to absorb. I can call it back from a botched ritual where a circle too closely resembles a square, from my cultists who fall in battle, from fountains, plants, and even stones (yes, reader: blood from a stone).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don’t like killing the cultists. Partially because it leaves me with one less cultist, making my unholy army a little weaker. But partly because it doesn’t feel right. I brought them into this.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When my cult kills our enemies, or some of our own fall in battle, I perform a tribute ritual, inserting an upside-down triangle into the center of a circle I draw around the corpses of the dead. My reward is a chest, which might contain anything from a relic I can offer at an altar to a blood fountain to a catalyst. I can order my cult to carry catalysts back to our base, and plant them in the ground to gain new spells and perks like the ability to throw farther. As the cult grows in power, so do I, though I am still at the mercy of the world and require their aid. I have spells, yes, but they take setup. The violence of a mass of bodies is quicker, more efficient. By myself, I am nothing. Weak. The cult makes me whole. So I go, converting the godless, building favor with An-Ansgaidh. I break down the statues of The Last Church. I send the dead as tribute. I cover the world in my blood. My grimoire offers advice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I find followers in strange ways. I find a village stuck between worlds, in the middle of a half-completed rite because musicians played a song with instruments built from the bones of horrors, and it remains unfinished. I track them down, carry them back to their stage. The song they play is a bop. Much of Worship's visual and auditory language is incredible. Only evil things are black, colored inside white outlines. Everything else is white, outlined by black. It’s not subtle, but it’s effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, I gain enough favor to return to An-Ansgaidh victorious. It teleports my cult and I to The Last Church, something my grimoire blames for all of this earlier. I don’t understand until I get there and see a woman in white sitting next to a monster. They aren’t hurting anyone. The woman is singing. The monster sleeps with a little doll. Their names are Ulmira and Eleanor, respectively, and my god has commanded that they die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I go to work. Of the two, Ealnor is the larger threat, but I cannot hurt her. When my cult gets close, she stuns them, swipes at them, leaves several dead. When we run away, she shoots fire. Her doll, animated by magic, chases us across the screen. I dive out of the way; my cult follows. We move around the edges. “How do I do this?” I think. Then I discover that Ulmira is here, too. She can attack, but she is smaller and weaker. I set my cult on her and then the strangest thing happens. Eleanor comes to defend her, shielding her from harm. And this is how I win. I wait. I bide my time, until Ulmira is vulnerable. And then I set my cult on her, and Eleanor springs into action to save her, taking the damage herself. Dozens die. But in the end, I am victorious. Ulmira holds Eleanor in her arms as she dies. And then she breaks down in tears. This is where my demo ends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no denying that Worship feels good to play. That its minimalist art style looks beautiful. That the music is gorgeous. That it forces you to play smart, to use every resource. But I like that the last thing it did was make me feel bad. I am a cult leader serving a dark god. I will do nothing good with the power I gain. Winning shouldn’t feel good. And I am glad Worship understands that.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/worship-be-a-cult-leader-in-this-pikmin-inspired-roguelike]]></content:encoded>

        <h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 +</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In the world of Gamindustri, four CPUs (also known as Goddesses) battled for supremacy in the War of the Guardians. One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,705 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation 4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,416 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support. Use them to perform special attacks or swap them out at any time!</li><li><strong>Switch it Up with Plans</strong> – Use Plans to customize the game by changing up enemy difficulty, dungeon treasures, and more!</li><li><strong>Gear Galore</strong> – Craft unique equipment imbued with one or more abilities!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>20XX. Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends! Each is equipped with special skills that lend their support to Stella in her items quest, so choose wisely!</li><li><strong>Remake in Your Image!</strong> – Modify the world of Gamindustri to your liking by creating “Plans” that alter dungeon treasures, enemy difficulty, and more!</li><li><strong>Get Crafty!</strong> – Customize powerful equipment that can unlock the true power of the CPUs, unlocking a world of new skills for them to use!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/hyperdimension-neptunia-rebirth-trilogy-for-ps4-launches-september-30-in-the-west]]></content:encoded>

Once we get our hands on the Pro 3, we'll update this article with our experience. At the moment, the Pro 2 is our top pick for Switch players who prefer this control layout. Similarly, this is how we felt about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate Controller</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-nintendo-switch-2-controller-amazon-prime-day-gaming-deal/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">testing the Ultimate 2 series</a>, which offers a markedly improved experience. In short, the Pro 3 should probably be on your radar.</p><hr><p>The 8BitDo Pro 3 costs $20 more than the Pro 2, but the $70 price point aligns with the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, the manufacturer's flagship controller that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections. The Pro 2, meanwhile, only supported Bluetooth wireless and didn't come with a charging dock. The new version is the first non-Ultimate controller with a charging dock. A 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored in the bottom of the dock. The Pro series has always felt like the alternative flagship option for those who favor PlayStation over Xbox control layouts, and the Pro 3's specs solidify that.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 can be viewed as an alternative to the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a></strong>. Nintendo's official controller feels great and even has a pair of back buttons, but there's no denying that 8BitDo's pair of premium gamepads are more versatile thanks to its suite of physical modifications and programmable customization options.</p><p>The TMR sticks on the Ultimate 2 are awesome, so it's exciting to see the tech added to the Pro series. 8BitDo's TMR sticks are noticeably smoother, more accurate, consume less power, and are said to be even more durable than the Hall Effect sticks found on the Pro 2, Ultimate, and other older controllers in the collection. Like Hall Effect, TMR sticks use magnetic sensors to register movements; this naturally reduces wear and prevents stick-drift issues from arising over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 has magnetic ABXY buttons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the TMR sticks, the Pro 3 mirrors the Ultimate 2's remappable buttons and trigger adjustments. It has two remappable back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons that are activated by microswitches. If you flip the switches on the back, the Hall Effect triggers become non-linear microswitch triggers. The latter shortens the pull distance, effectively turning the triggers into speedy buttons.</p><p>There are a couple of differences between the Pro 3 and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. The Ultimate 2 series has rings around the sticks with adjustable RGB lighting effects. The Pro 3 has an upgraded D-pad with improved tactile feedback. Interestingly, the G Classic edition has a series of raised ridges--three in each direction--whereas the purple and gray models have the familiar directional arrows instead.</p><p>The Pro 3 also has a customization option that will be a big deal for some players: swappable face buttons. Inside the box, you'll find a small tool to remove the magnetic ABXY buttons. You can then reverse A/B and X/Y to fit your preference for Nintendo's and Microsoft's button layout. Though the Pro 3 doesn't offer Xbox console support, you can use it for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well as for games you have installed on Steam Deck, Windows, mobile devices, etc. Xbox's control layout, with Y on top and A on the bottom, is generally considered the default for any platform not made by Nintendo or PlayStation.</p><p>With the Ultimate 2 series, you need to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCWSX17,B0DRCV3SPH,B0DRCWJSKZ,B0F9P4P6HB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the 2.4GHz-only model</a> to get the Xbox layout and the Bluetooth model for Nintendo compatibility. The Ultimate series has always had a separate 2.4GHz model for PC players and a slightly more expensive model that adds Bluetooth and Switch support. There's nothing wrong with that release model, especially for those who aren't interested in Nintendo consoles. But it's cool that 8BitDo created a built-in solution for those who have issues with Nintendo's control layout on other platforms. You could even remap the buttons after switching their locations to use Xbox's layout on Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337"></a><figcaption>The ball-top stick caps match each controller's theme. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532339,1300-4532340" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"></figure><p>According to 8BitDo, the ball-top stick caps were "made purely for fun," but we're looking forward to checking them out. Regardless of whether they feel practical to use, they look pretty cool on the Pro 3 and are themed around the controller's color. For instance, the retro gray NES/SNES-inspired model comes with a pair of red ball-top caps. If you opt for the GameCube-themed purple edition, you'll get yellow ball-tops.</p><p>With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 app, you can adjust stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivities, create dead zones, modify rumble intensity, and remap inputs. Up to three unique control configurations can be saved directly to the controller, and you can cycle through them on the fly by pressing the profile button.</p><hr><h2>8BitDo is having a big year</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353" data-ratio="0.35" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png"></figure><p>The Pro 3 is just the latest major addition to 8BitDo's impressive accessory lineup in 2025.

                <p>Something has gone awry during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new update, and the the mega-popular online shooter/metaverse is down. Epic has acknowledged the error with <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1945120590756495735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on @FortniteStatus</a> that offers no indication of how long the game will remain offline.</p><p>"Hey everyone, we're extending downtime while we work to resolve an issue discovered during offline checks. We'll do our best to get Fortnite servers online ASAP. Keep an eye on this thread for any future updates."</p><p>There's unlikely to be any further explanation from Epic, but the fact that the company has publicly acknowledged a delay likely means it won't be resolved all that quickly--there's a possibility it will remain offline into the evening. If a fix was coming within an hour or two, Epic would almost certainly have just hunkered down and finished it instead of posting about it. While we have no official explanation for the delay, one datamining group <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1945090149949272330" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has suggested</a> it's because the new patch doesn't account for a server-side hotfix that was deployed last week.</p><p>It's not the most opportune moment for this to happen, since this patch is Fortnite's first update in a month, and is intended to introduce Superman's Fortress of Solitude to the Battle Royale island, along with all sorts of other goodies like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945074480662892874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Fantastic Four skins</a> that will likely be sold alongside the new movie later this month. It's another delay for Superman-related content, after the arrival of the new David Corenswet Superman skin on the battle pass was marred by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-superman-cosmetics-are-bugged/1100-6533120/" data-ref-id="1100-6533120">a bug</a> that prevented most folks from being able to unlock it.</p>

            <p>
Cast your mind back, and you might recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s eventual, near-decade-long journey to release. Well, a former exec overseeing the project has now spoken a little more on its troubled development, claiming its scrapped first iteration would have "killed the franchise".
</p>
<p>
Dead Island 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-announced">initially announced back in 2014</a>, with the expectation it would launch the following year. However, delays ensued and 2015 brought the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-is-no-longer-being-made-by-yager">developer Yager had departed the project</a>, with studio boss Timo Ullmann saying its vision for the project "fell out of alignment" with publisher Deep Silver. Development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-sumo-digital-sonic-racing">shifted to Sumo Digital</a> and finally to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a>, which released Dead Island 2 to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">solid critical reception</a> in 2023.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2">reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has shed a little more light on Dead Island 2's troubled journey during a panel at Develop:Brighton. Asked for an example of when marketing or player research had helped get a development team back on track after it had veered away from a design vision, Wein specifically cited Dead Island 2, highlighting it as an instance of when he and his team had caused an "eight-year product delay".
</p>
<p>
As recounted by Wein, Deep Silver had a "major milestone with the [then] development studio" shortly after its 2014 E3 reveal. "And boy, that game sucked... It had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun. So we commissioned a play test and got horrific feedback." Wein later told GamesIndustry. biz, "the developer wanted to pursue their vision rather than follow player feedback", and when the game remained the same at the next milestone, the decision was made to find a new studio.
</p>
<p>
"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein continued during his panel appearance. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise... I think at that point Deep Silver did the right thing, and Dead Island 2 was a commercial success in the end. Because they took that step, and they said that we need to make a game that fits for the player."
</p>
<p>
All of which resolves at least some of the early mystery around Dead Island 2's troubles. As to its quiet time at Sumo Digital, Wein shared nothing on that period of its development - but its strange saga did at least have a happy ending. When Dead Island 2 finally released in 2023, some nine years after its announcement, the gory zombie sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-shifts-1m-copies-in-its-first-weekend-of-release">successfully shifted 1m units in its first weekend of sales</a>, and was loitering somewhere around the 4m mark by February this year. Hopefully a third entry, should it ever happen, will have a smoother road to release.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> developer King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>. This included roughly 200 staff from King.</p>
<p>Now, in a report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a>, sources stated they've spent the last few years building and training AI tools, which will now be replacing them.</p>
<p>"Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker," said one source from the company. "Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating."</p>
<p>They added replacing people with AI tools was "absolutely disgusting", but the focus is "all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall".</p>
<p>"If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership," they said.</p>
<p>Further, some programmers have been laid off for "arbitrary reasons", said the source, claiming staff may have been removed after expressing "dissatisfaction with the company or processes".</p>
<p>Another source described King's HR department as "an absolute shitshow and has been for years", adding it's an "extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff".</p>
<p>Back at the Game Developer Conference in May 2023, King's chief technology officer Steve Collins described to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-games-industrys-response-to-ai-reverence-and-rage">the ambition for King to pivot to an "AI-first company"</a>, after it acquired Swedish AI company Peltarion in 2022.</p>
<p>AI is a "tool" that's "in the hands of our level designers and our level testers, so they use that to augment what they're able to do in those spaces," said Collins. When asked if this might mean a shift from human workers to a reliance on AI, Collins replied: "I think we still have a large number of human beings, that's the thing! What we're trying to do is: how do we scale? How do we scale or create thousands of new levels?"</p>
<p>Discussing further, Collins added: "The reality is, this sort of technology can be leveraged. What it does is, it can move people up the stack, it can move people to the point where they're being more creative, they have more agency to bring to the content creation pipeline or whatever."</p>
<p>Now, it appears to have moved people out of the company.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment on this report and the claims staff will be replaced by AI.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Online Studios was also impacted by layoffs at Microsoft. Now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">its union has spoken out</a>, stating those impacted will "depart with dignity".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build]]></content:encoded>

Topics discussed in the interview include redesigning Donkey Kong, figuring out the game’s tone and mood, and more. But one part that caught my attention is when Daisuke Watanabe, the game’s art director, and Wataru Tanaka, another director on <em>Bananza</em>, discussed voxel technology and the Switch 2 hardware. </p><p>The entire discussion around voxel tech, which allows the ground and terrain in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-nintendo-direct-diddy-1851784735"><em>Bananza</em></a></span><em> </em>to deform and break apart dynamically, is surprisingly deep and worth reading. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/#:~:text=Tanaka%3A%20From,the%20game%20possible." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The key moment came at the end</a></span>, when Tanaka explained that after experimenting with pushing voxel tech on the OG Switch, they discovered it wasn’t powerful enough to let them go as wild as they wanted. So the game hopped over to Switch 2 and suddenly was running at a smooth 60FPS. </p><p>“With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity,” said Tanaka. “That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we’d previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 FPS. Things we’d given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible.” </p><p>Watanabe further added that with <em>Bananza </em>running at 60FPS, smashing up the world became a lot more “satisfying” and was a big improvement over 30FPS. </p><p>“The physics of smashing involve lots of things all happening at once,” explained Watanabe. “Donkey Kong throws a punch, the terrain and objects break apart, and visual effects show debris flying outward. All of that is packed into a single moment. At 30 fps, we couldn’t fully capture everything that happens in that instant. But at 60 fps, we saw that sense of destruction coming through much more clearly.” </p><p>Watanabe added: “Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game’s full potential – no, it made the game possible.”<br></p><p>As a self-described video game tech snob who values high framerates, I’m very, very happy that the team behind <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>decided to focus so much on nailing 60FPS. Now, I just have to wait until July 17 to play the <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> team’s next big 3D platformer. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-switch-2-60fps-30fps-nintendo-1851786303]]></content:encoded>

That's how we learned <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/you-can-skip-locations-and-parts-of-the-story-in-donkey-kong-bananza-thanks-to-the-games">you can skip locations and part of the story in Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, thanks to the game's destruction gameplay. It's also how we learned the game's destruction gameplay can be traced back to a Goomba with arms in Super Mario Odyssey.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked by the interviewer about the origins of Bananza's destruction mechanics, one of the game's directors, Wataru Tanaka, explained the team (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/01/the-super-mario-odyssey-team-developed-donkey-kong-bananza">which also developed Super Mario Odyssey</a>) had already been researching smashing mechanics before development on Bananza began. "Shortly after Super Mario Odyssey was released, we started running technical experiments with the idea of, 'What kind of game do you get if everything in the environment is destructible?'"&nbsp;</p><p>That's when producer Kenta Motokura chimed in to add, "We even tried sticking arms on a Goomba."&nbsp;</p><p>"That's right, we did," Tanaka said. "In Super Mario Odyssey, there's a boss called Knucklotec who attacks Mario with giant hands. The programmer who created him tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them. Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic."&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">interview</a> features a short behind-the-scenes clip showcasing this Goomba with arms smashing a prototype rocky environment – check out the screenshot below:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Motokura concludes the question by explaining, "The results of our tests showed that destruction-based gameplay could work, and it was a good match for Donkey Kong's enormous strength.

            <p>The ZeniMax Online Studios developer union has spoken out following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">significant cuts that impacted a vast number of staff at the studio</a>, resulting in uncertain futures for many developers and the cancellation of unannounced MMO Blackbird.</p>
<p>The union, formed in December last year, released a public statement addressing the layoffs. It confirmed that the 22 developers represented by the union who were working on Blackbird remain employed at the moment, but how long that will remain the case remains unclear.</p>
<p>It stated bargaining continues between Microsoft and the union, and while it acknowledges that layoffs may lie in the future for various represented staff, it hopes those who'll lose their jobs will " be able to depart with dignity."</p>

<p>The full statement reads as follows: "Earlier this month, Microsoft indefinitely shelved an unannounced MMORPG at ZeniMax Online Studios, a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on the project. It has been heartening and validating to see our game mentioned in the press and by players that would have loved to see the results of our work.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly, a future has been stolen from many of us and our community will never experience an amazing game. However, despite discussions regarding the status of our employment, the fact is: we have not yet been laid off.</p>
<p>"While we understand that for most of us something like a layoff is inevitable, last December both the teams behind The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) and the unannounced project voted overwhelmingly to form a union and establish ZeniMax Online Studios United-CWA (ZOSU-CWA). Worker-volunteers elected to represent the interests of our union are currently bargaining with Microsoft for the benefit of our impacted teammates.</p>
<p>"While Microsoft and ZOSU-CWA bargain over how we move forward following the project closure, the developers behind the unannounced project remain employees of ZeniMax Online Studios with full pay and benefits.</p>
<p>"On July 2nd, our lives were upended without prior notice or communication from Microsoft leadership and without clear understanding about the status of our employment. In light of this, our union came together with urgency, gathering and distributing information and resources to our affected members.</p>
<p>"Where Microsoft has failed to support the talented craftspeople who have generated billions in revenue, our union has stepped up to provide clarity and support.</p>
<p>"It is true that a layoff may be in the future for some of our members. However, as a result of our organising, we are able to ensure that those impacted will be able to depart with dignity.</p>
<p>"More importantly, the work of ZOSU-CWA will continue so that our remaining teammates - the stalwart developers of ESO - can follow in the footsteps of our colleagues across other departments and studios at Microsoft, including our union siblings at ZeniMax Workers United (ZWU-CWA). We look forward to other units who will soon ratify fair contracts that will guarantee the rights we all deserve."</p>
<p>In the wake of the MMO's cancellation, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-head-matt-firor-announces-departure-following-widespread-layoffs-and-the-cancellation-of-in-development-mmo">studio head Matt Firor announced his departure from the company</a>. Across all studios hurt by the layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">roughly 9,000 developers have been affected</a>, from companies including Rare, Turn10, and more.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a nutshell, it's confirmed that the development team started to think about moving the game over to the Switch 2 in 2021.

<p>Here's what was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> We originally began developing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> on Nintendo Switch, but we ran into some challenges. I think it was around 2021 when we started to think about moving development to Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Watanabe:</strong> We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2. One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game’s core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> From a programmer’s perspective, voxel technology is well-suited for creating gameplay centered around destruction. However, it also uses a lot of system memory, and we faced the challenge of Switch not having enough to support everything we wanted to do.</p>
<p>I'll explain with some simple arithmetic. If you're asked to double the size of a 1 × 1 pixel image in both width and height, you end up with a 2 × 2 image, which means four times as many pixels. But when you do the same with voxels, you've got width and height, but also depth to contend with. So, doubling all three dimensions gives you 2 × 2 × 2, or eight times the data. It may sound simple to just “double something,” but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform.</p>
<p>With the move to Switch 2, we gained not only more memory but also greater processing capacity. That gave us the freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas we'd previously abandoned because they were too demanding. When we got down to trying it, we discovered that not only could it handle the heavy processing requirements, but it also ran at 60 fps. Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible. Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, “Now we can really do this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, with that context in place, let's take a look at how the game differs between the two consoles:</p>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 vs. Switch 2 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c71d8b1e10ea/switch-1-vs-switch-2-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/eu/media/images/news_12/2025/july_40/atd19/CI_NSwitch2_ATD_DonkeyKongBananza_ins08_GB_en.jpg">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn't look <em>bad</em>, right? But it's clear just how much Nintendo was able to implement into the game world with the Switch 2, in addition to some fancy crepuscular rays shining down from above.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is launching this week on <strong>17th July 2025</strong>. It was recently reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">physical copies of the game have managed to sneak out into the wild</a>, so be wary of what you're looking at online if you don't want to be spoiled.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/">MobileGamer.biz</a> claims that 200 developers at Candy Crush studio King are at the risk of being laid off as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's latest mass layoff</a>, and will be replaced by the AI tools they were told to build.</p>



<p>King is the mobile division of Activision Blizzard King, and arguably was the division out of Microsoft's ABK acquisition that its gaming team needed the most, since Microsoft lacked any presence in the mobile gaming industry. Buying the studio that makes Candy Crush, one of the biggest and most well-known mobile games around the world, changed that overnight. </p>



<p>But as it's been<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/"> reported multiple times</a>, Microsoft's cuts are allegedly not concerned with anything beyond the company wanting to get ahead, and stay ahead<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsofts-in-house-ai-chip-delayed-as-firm-worried-about-losing-to-nvidia-in-competitiveness/">, in the AI race</a>. Now, this report from MobileGamer.biz shows the<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/"> inevitable endgame that every bean counter pushing AI and generative AI tools has in mind, being put into practice</a>. That every part of the job they currently pay people to do can be replaced by an AI tool.</p>



<p>"<em>Most of level design has been wiped, which is crazy since they've spent months building tools to craft levels quicker</em>," said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>Now those AI tools are basically replacing the teams. Similarly the copywriting team is completely removing people since we now have AI tools that those individuals have been creating</em>."</p>



<p>The report also adds that certain employees are being targeted and getting laid off for "<em>arbitrary reasons</em>," with a source claiming that people who have been vocally speaking out against decisions made by leadership are now set to lose their jobs. A different source in the report claims that the HR department at King is "<em>an absolute shitshow and has been for years. An extreme example of an HR department whose role it is to protect the company, not the staff</em>."</p>



<p>So far, the line from any company that's implementing generative AI tools into their game development process, King included, has always been that the AI tool will take care of the more tedious, mundane tasks, while the human developers can focus on the more complex, creativity-focused parts of making games. Reporter for The Logic, Brendan Sinclair, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brendansinclair.bsky.social/post/3ltytlpz3ws2s">pointed out that just last year,</a> King's director of AI labs, Sahar Asadi, had that exact message as part of her talk at GDC 2024. </p>



<p>Now, those designers who were supposed to have more time to be creative, are being replaced entirely by these AI tools. An internal memo sent out to King developers claims that these cuts  are about "<em>making several changes to get the business back to growth" </em>and that "<em>unlocking many more AI tools"</em> is one element of that. It also goes on to explain that this is about having "<em>fewer layers, fewer overlapping remits, fewer hours spent on alignment, fewer people in meetings, fewer stakeholders for every project</em>."</p>



<p>According to a source in the report, it could be the case that more than 200 developers are cut from King, impacting the Candy Crush team, half of the Farm Heroes Saga team, and developers working in London, Barcelona, Stockholm, and Berlin-based studios. </p>



<p>"<em>The fact AI tools are replacing people is absolutely disgusting but it's all about efficiency and profits even though the company is doing great overall,</em>" said a source that MobileGamer.biz spoke to. "<em>If we're introducing more feedback loops then it's crazy to remove the developers themselves, we need more hands and less leadership.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-path</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-plans-for-dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-square-enix-says.1244001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that it isn't planning to implement any kind of upgrade path for the Switch 2 version of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;package.</p>

<p>In a new FAQ on its website, Square Enix says there is "no upgrade path currently available or planned" for the game, and that if you want to play the Switch 2 version, you'll have to buy that one separately, regardless of whether you've purchased the Switch version or not.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">other Switch games</a>, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>will come complete with improved visuals and performance on Nintendo's newest console, although Square Enix does say there are "no differences in the story, game content, or in which items can be obtained" between both versions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-steps.jpg?itok=W5sKmgbk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-steps.jpg?itok=SOZEC4Iw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>won't have a Switch 2 upgrade path, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Buying the Switch version of the game will enable you to play it on both the Switch and the Switch 2, but you'll just be playing the original Switch version on the newer hardware; unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">certain Nintendo games</a>, there won't be any free update to improve performance for the original Switch version on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can't transfer save data between the two versions, nor can you use download codes for the Switch 2 version on the original Switch game, or vice-versa. They're treated as separate software, so they're not inter-compatible in any way.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though, if you've played&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the original Switch, that still entitles you to in-game bonuses for the new games, even if you buy them on Switch 2.</p>

<p>It's worth reading Square Enix's full FAQ for the Switch and Switch 2 versions of its new HD-2D&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games if you've got any other questions about how the games will work across Nintendo hardware. You can <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/roto-trilogy/dq1and2/faq/en.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do that right here</a>.</p>

Imagine having <em>that</em> in your living room. Instead, an early glimpse suggests the figure will measure about the same height as Pikachu, although given its fiery base taking half the height, it’s depicted considerably smaller than ol’ electric cheeks. It’ll still be a very impressive piece of completely needless nonsense to own, but unlikely to scare away unruly children.</p><p>Charizard isn’t open for pre-orders yet, so this is looking like a measured roll-out, perhaps even a careful testing of the market. Sideshow makes its money selling premium figures, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sideshow.com/collectibles/marvel-venom-hot-toys-912829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this astonishing one-sixth scale Venom</a></span> for an eye-watering $460 (although it is over 20 inches tall), so this is their stock-in-trade. But might Pokémon skew a little young for its audience? It’ll be interesting to see.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-statue-figure-life-size-sideshow-1851786279]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Like most open-world games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will have its fair share of collectibles to hunt down. The catch here is that you'll need to really work to get your hands on collectible bobblehead replicas of everyone's refund-adverse arms dealer, Marcus, as these will be hidden away in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>As detailed by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, the idea for these collectibles came from the studio wanting to push the game's enhanced move-set to its very limits. Borderlands 4 has several new traversal options--including gliding, double-jumping, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/" data-ref-id="1100-6528427">and using a grapple-hook to move around areas</a>--and Gearbox wanted to reward players with a memento for reaching remote spots on the map.</p><p>"Graeme Timmons--Borderlands 4's creative director--got with some of our designers and other artists and engineers and decided that we needed something for players to find when they made their way to these remote or uninhabited areas," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944529531978858850" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>. "We wanted something of an icon. The same kind of thing in each spot, so players would <em>know</em> they found it. The item had to be simple, recognizable, have a feeling of being something one might collect--and ideally--having real connections to our universe."</p><p>This led to the Marcus bobblehead being chosen, and there's even an in-universe reason for these being on the isolationist planet of Kairos. As Pitchford noted, there are "well over 200" of these bobbleheads to collect, and he expects that most players will never see any of them. "A very, very small number of people will explore Kairos so completely that they might discover them all. Each has a story," Pitchford added, while also throwing down a gauntlet to players with the inclusion of a map showing off the locations of these collectibles.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944532238554812905" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">All in all, there are well over 200 Marcus Bobbleheads hidden around Kairos.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>With Nintendo's next Switch 2 exclusive game, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, just <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-is-a-new-nintendo-switch-2-platformer-starring">two days away from launch</a>, the company has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> about the game's development. In the final section of the series, one of Bananza's directors, Kazuya Takahashi, said players can skip locations and parts of the story in the game, thanks to its unique destruction gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's a lot of leeway in terms of progression in this game," Takahashi said when asked about any final words he might have to close out the interview. "For example, locations or parts of the story you can skip without suffering any consequences. When the game progresses in a way we hadn't intended, we call it a 'sequence break' in development terminology. Typically, in game development, restrictions are put in place to prevent this from happening, but since this game is all about destruction, we wanted people to play freely."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, it sounds like there's a lot of leeway given to players when it comes to destruction and what they're able to accomplish by destroying the environment around them. It can even lead to skipping story sections or locations; however, given Nintendo's typically high standard of quality, it's unlikely that players will be able to skip critical parts of the game.
