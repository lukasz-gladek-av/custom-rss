            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-add-ad-based-and-cloud-only-xbox-game-pass-tiers-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Microsoft’s changes to its Xbox Game Pass tiers could be continuing, according to a new report. Sources at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> say that Microsoft is looking into adding more tiers to Xbox Game Pass, including ad-based  and cloud-only options.</p>



<p>First, regarding the cloud-only tier, this would reportedly be a cheaper tier where you wouldn’t need to own an Xbox console. You’d just need a platform that can access cloud-based games on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>“This would be designed around users who simply aren’t interested in buying an Xbox console, which could include competing console platform players,” the report says. “It could also be for users who don’t like the upfront costs of owning any console whatsoever.”</p>



<p>As far as the ad-based tier is concerned, the report stats that Microsoft has been “exploring the potential” of one. However, there are no plans to launch an ad-based tier at this moment.</p>







<p>Lastly, the report mentions a possibility of the return of a Family and Friends plan for the service. Originally, Microsoft tested the idea back in 2022 and 2023. That test <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was available in various regions</a>, charging $24.99 per month for up to five people to access a single subscription.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the latest reports. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large changes to current tiers</a>, including scrapping Xbox Game Pass Console in favor of the new, more expensive, Xbox Game Pass Standard.</p>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studio has recently joined the CWA Union (Communications Workers of America), and Microsoft has recognized the union as of July 19.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/22/everything-we-know-about-dragon-age-the-veilguards-bellara-lutara<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We've reached the end of <em>Game Informer's</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story coverage as we prepare to launch our next exciting issue. But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it's about Bellara Lutara, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/27/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">the game's expansive character creator</a>, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.</p>

<p>Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a <a href="https://youtu.be/CTNwHShylIg?si=tvYCaZjeSa-qkIRQ">20-minute gameplay trailer</a>&nbsp;last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the studio to see the mission where you meet her, I spent a chunk of my interviews with the team's leads talking about Bellara. So, for my final feature on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, here's everything I learned about this quirky elven mage.&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4d623755-9990-44d2-a36d-35750b45dd9a" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>In talking with BioWare's various leads, like game director Corinne Bushce, creative director John Epler (who is personally responsible for writing Bellara and leading her development), and BioWare general manager Gary McKay, it's clear the team has a deep love for this character. She's energetic, effervescent, and academic, and as a companion for combat, she's a character I’m pretty excited to use in my party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love Bellara, I think she's fantastic," McKay tells me. "I see people that I know in her and so that's how she really resonates with me. I love the whole tinkerer aspect to her. It was a collective to bring that character to life. It was everything from the writers, to the editors, the animators, to character modelers, to the texturing, to how we light her. I'm really proud of that character."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bellara In Combat</h3>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3e786997-2974-482d-828b-1299d2d83245" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>When I ask Busche about Bellara, she gives me some insight into what I can expect of the mage on the battlefield. And Bellara sounds like an excellent choice for both support and elemental combos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Oh my goodness, she is amazing," Busche says. "So, first of all, she is a mage. She is an explorer of ancient Elven ruins. She is an elf herself and a member of the Veil Jumpers faction. They investigate the ancient ruins of Arlathan. Everything about her character as a mage leans into that, but she also challenges the kind of archetypal idea of a mage."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She does that by attacking with a bow at range using electrically charged arrows. But she's also casting spells that slow down time or heal allies and Rook. She does that by channeling magical energy into her gauntlet. Busche says she starts as a support character in combat, thanks to her healing spells, but notes players don't have to build her out that way. She also leans into electrical damage, and "damage type really matters a lot when we get into the strategy and tactics," Busche says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can spec her out in a way where she's unleashing this devastating vortex that pulls in all enemies into an electrical storm. Maybe then we unleash our own [area of effect attack] with all the enemies clumped together," Busche adds. "She can debuff all the enemies with the shocked affliction, where they're taking passive damage. I mentioned she can slow time, she can heal. She is one of the characters that you can build out [to have her] healing spells heal you autonomously, so if you're the kind of player that likes to be on the frontlines [...] Bellara might just be the perfect companion for you."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bellara's Place In The World</h3>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="97849e01-d981-4fe5-91ce-033aefbd8201" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Epler, who writes Bellara, tells me about her place in Thedas as an elf and the connection elves have to the magic of the world. He says if you've paid attention to the franchise, you likely already know that elves are historically an oppressed people in the games. Now, with two of their gods on the loose in Veilguard, magic has poured back into the world in a big way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She represents the Veil Jumpers," Epler explains. "Now, the Veil Jumpers are a faction that's appeared in the comics before, but otherwise, this is the first time it's appeared in the games, and they are the ones journeying through Arlathan, where the ancient elven empire used to exist and left a lot of artifacts when it disappeared. When the elves fell from immortality thousands of years ago, they still left a lot of their artifacts and a lot of their, for lack of a better term, magical technology behind, and Bellara represents this yearning to find the truth of who the elves were because not only did they lose their magic and their immortality, they lost a lot of their history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A lot of what they know of their past is based on myth, it's based on rumor. Bellara is a knowledge seeker. She wants to find out what's true, what's not; she wants to find the pieces of who the elves used to be and really understand what their story was, where they came from, as well as figure out where they're going next, and find a future for the elves. And within the context of The Veilguard, she joins the team, first of all, to help stop the gods because Bellara feels at least partially responsible since they are elven gods, but also to maybe find a little bit more of who they used to be. Because again, you're dealing with these elves that were around millennia ago that have now reemerged into the world, and who better to teach her who the elves used to be than them."</p>

<h3>A Quick Detour: Magic</h3>

<p>For one of my last questions to Epler, I was curious about the contrast between Bellara, an elven mage who is optimistic and bubbly, and Solas, a determined and tragic character. He indicated there might be more to Bellara than meets the eye.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c645d6c8-af4e-403e-add8-a624bb426fd0" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"Solas sees himself as the tragic hero," Epler says. "He's not capable of really being happy, he can't let himself be happy, partially because he carries the guilt of what he did bringing the Veil, doing what he did to the world. Whereas Bellara is somebody who has seen tragedy, and as you get into her character arc and get into her backstory, you realize this is a character who has seen a lot of tragedy. But that tragedy, instead of wallowing in it, she's forced herself to push past it. She looks at her regrets, and she tells herself, 'I don't want to feel regret.'</p>

<p>"Whereas again, Solas tends to wallow in his to a large degree. And it allows us to create a very big differentiation. Part of it is also because Solas is an ancient elf, whereas Bellara is a Dalish elf, but she just sees a problem and wants to solve it. She feels a tremendous amount of responsibility to her people [...] to the Dalish, and to the Veil Jumpers, and that drives her forward. That said, she does have her moments where she has doubt, she has moments where she has a more grim outlook, and there are moments where you realize that some of her sunny, optimistic outlook is kind of a mask that she puts on to hide the fact that she's hurting, she's in pain. But in general, she doesn't see any benefit to wallowing in those regrets."</p>

<p>We learned today that Bellara will be voiced by Jee Young Han, known for her roles in&nbsp;<em>Perry Mason,</em>&nbsp;<em>Unprisoned,</em>&nbsp;and as Sentinel Dax in a previous Bioware game, Anthem.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-creator-bought-by-warner-bros-discovery<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
<article role="article" about="/gaming/news/multiversus-creator-bought-by-warner-bros-discovery">
<div>



<div>
<div><p>Fresh out of Evo, Warner Bros. announced that they have acquired the developer of platform fighter <em>Multiversus</em> for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Player First Games fits WB Games' strategy of focusing on live service games, as they lockdown the creator of the free-to-play crossover fighter, while keeping the same talent in charge of the studio. It seems that despite <em>Multiversus</em> open beta being closed before the game was reworked some for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" MultiVersus Release Date Revealed for May, New Characters and Stages Coming">full release in May</a>, WB Games is committed to the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch <em>MultiVersus</em>, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games. The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities.”&nbsp; - David Haddad, President, Warner Bros. Games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That can change quickly with Warner Bros. Discovery which has been somewhat chaotic for a while and is continuing to attempt to right itself after the costly merger between WB and Discovery. This has led to many layoffs and controversial decisions over the last few years. Recently that has hit the game division, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Mortal Kombat: Onslaught to Shut Down Amid NetherRealm Mobile Layoffs">Warner Bros. Games closing <em>Mortal Kombat: Onslaught</em></a>, and laying off most of the NetherRealms mobile team. Other choices, like the live service focus of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adult-swim-games-delisting-warner-bros" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Adult Swim Games Titles Are Being Pulled From Digital Stores by Parent Company Warner Bros">delisting of many Adult Swim games</a> from storefronts, are part of this ongoing disorganization and live service focus.</p>

<h2><em>Multiversus </em>Season 2 Launches Tomorrow</h2>
<p>The big fighting game tournament EVO was over this past weekend, and <em>Multiversus</em> joined many games displaying what is coming in the future for the game. While some were showing off things further off, the future is tomorrow with <em>Multiversus</em> with season 2, and they showed off the first Samurai Jack gameplay. Season 2's launch will also include ranked mode, for people to earn exclusive cosmetic rewards for getting sufficiently sweaty, and the Water Tower, a new map based on the WB water tower.</p>

<p>Later in the season, expect to see Beetlejuice, as they aim to launch the character later in the season. This will position it closer to the release of <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>, the sequel to 1988's <em>Beetlejuice</em>, as part of the whole purpose of <em>Multiversus</em> is to take advantage of the wealth of IP at WB Discovery's disposal and to help promote releases. That release will put it closer to the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Heihachi Mishima Comes to Tekken 8 as DLC This Fall">Heihachi Mishima's release</a> for <em>Tekken 8</em> which was also revealed at Evo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/ride-the-wave-in-surfpunk-a-new-co-op-action-rpg/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There has been a dearth of games based around surfing, but it looks like Double Stallion Games is out to rectify that with its new co-op action RPG called Surfpunk. In Surfpunk, players take on the role of Raiders in the ruins of the The Fallen World, which is a flooded anime inspired world. The aim is to jump on your Rushboard to explore, scavenge, and fight.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surfpunk - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/63j0Mo0mXFU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The main reason for scavenging in Surfpunk is to find and secure a resource known as Evress. Evress is the energy source that powers everything in the world, and it comes from the ruins of the ancient world. It is not all easy as otherworldy creatures know as Sumi will attack players as time progresses. That means exploration in some areas is time limited, meaning players will have to make choices on what to loot and what to leave behind, before the Sumi become aware of their presence and attack. The world will change with each run as the islands are randomly generated with fresh enemy encounters. There will be a crafting mechanism allowing players to craft armour, and gear like ladders to reach hard to reach areas. On the co-op side, players can team up and explore the world as well as participate in PvE raids.</p>
<p>Surfpunk has been confirmed for PC, but a release date has not been set. The PC requirements have been stated, and those can be seen below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203663/evo-2024-recap-street-fighter-6-street-fighter-third-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201924/how-to-watch-evo-2024-schedule-twitch">Evo 2024</a> wrapped up late Sunday night with Victor “Punk” Woodley beating Adel “Big Bird” Anouche in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23741204/street-fighter-6-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>. With his victory, Woodley became the first American to win a mainline <em>Street Fighter </em>tournament at Evo in over 20 years.</p><p>The match was nail-bitingly close with Anouche, who made it to the grand finals via the loser’s bracket, beating Woodley 3-0 to reset or “flip” the bracket requiring another best-of-5 match to determine the winner. Their second match went the distance, with each player having two set wins a piece and tied 1-1 in the final match. A well-executed super move from Woodley’s Cammy ended the match and America’s long <em>Street Fighter </em>Evo championship drought along with it. </p><p>Americans actually fared exceedingly well at Evo 2024, taking home championships in four of the eight main tournaments: <em>Street Fighter 6 (</em> Victor “Punk” Woodley), <em>Mortal Kombat 1 </em>(Dominique&nbsp;“SonicFox”&nbsp;McLean), <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising </em>(Aaron&nbsp;“Aarondamac”&nbsp;Godinez), and <em>Guilty Gear Strive</em> (Shamar&nbsp;”Nitro”&nbsp;Hinds). </p><p>Additionally,<em> Street Fighter 6</em> wasn’t the only <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament at Evo where memorable moments were made. Over in the <em>Street Fighter III: Third Strike</em> tournament, <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/Hayao">Hayao</a>, a player from Japan, memed his way into our hearts with his infectious enthusiasm and over-the-top celebrations. During one celebration, <a href="https://x.com/Scollomania/status/1814817168887832875">he bent his body clean in half</a>, touching head to floor in a pose only characters from <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> seem capable of. In another, he bust it open on the main stage completing a full split — notable, as Hayao is 41 years old.</p><p>But Hayao cemented his place in the Evo history books with playing skill. During the loser’s quarterfinal with only a pixel’s worth of health, Hayao pulled off an astounding parry — <em>in</em> <em>mid-air — </em>then deftly sailed over his opponent’s follow-up super attack to come back and beat his opponent, advancing to the next round. </p><p>Hayao unfortunately didn’t win the tournament, falling in his next match to finish in fourth place. But his incredible display of skill was so electrifying that some are referring to it as “Evo Moment 38,” or the spiritual successor to <a href="https://youtu.be/JzS96auqau0?si=L1jF7xHb3b1ZdldL">Evo Moment 37</a> — perhaps the greatest clip of fighting game competition of all time. Even though he didn’t win, Hayao still <em>won</em>.</p><p>There was a smattering of other hype Evo 2024 moments. Twitch streamer LilyPichu won a <em>Tekken 8 </em>show match against the game’s producer Katsuhiro Harada. <em>Tekken 8</em> <a href="https://youtu.be/QZWDIKKvNrc?si=KLIM7NLtl_9CVKjX">resurrected the franchise’s longtime villain Heihachi Mishima</a> despite Harada remarking more than once that the character was well and truly dead. Evo also plans to add two new events in 2025 with the first <a href="https://www.evo.gg/news/the-evo-awards-powered-by-qiddiya---coming-february-2025">Evo Awards</a> taking place in Los Angeles and Evo France, marking the tournament’s first appearance in Europe. Evo is already the biggest, most exciting fighting game tournament in the world, and it’s good to see that it continues to grow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is also getting a ranked mode.</p>

<p>Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice are part of the Season 2: Back in Time content, which kicks off tomorrow, July 23. Jack becomes available at launch, letting players cut down opponents using his signature katana (as you can see in the trailer below). Beetlejuice arrives later in the season at an unknown date, so we don't get to see him in action just yet. However, Warner Bros. confirms he’ll become playable before the September 6 theatrical premiere of <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5AtpYPz2Ic" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2 also introduces a new ranked mode, allowing players to battle for leaderboard points to earn exclusive rank-based cosmetics. A new map, the Warner Bros. Water Tower, will also be added.</p>

<p>MultiVersus is available now on PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as PC. Since its return, the game has been bolstered by new fighters such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/13/check-out-the-jokers-multiversus-gameplay-and-the-batman-who-laughs-alternate-costume">The Joker</a>, The Matrix's<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/20/multiversus-launch-trailer-reveals-jason-voorhees-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith"> Agent Smith</a>, and Friday the 13th's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/jason-voorhees-gets-a-dedicated-multiversus-trailer">Jason Voorhees</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-now-catch-%E2%80%98em-all-in-escape-from-tarkov-spt.933903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pokemon-spt/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Escape from Tarkov has a single-player mod-driven ecosystem called SPT. It was popular long before Battlestate Games introduced the same thing with the new ‘PvE’ mode, but the core difference is that SPT can be further modified and manipulated. </p>



<p>Recently, one modder introduced a Pokémon-themed mod to Escape from Tarkov’s SPT mod platform. It allows players to collect 156 unique cards and compile them into binders, fusing them with boosters and – best of all – display them in a new section added to the player hideout.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-the-very-best">Be The Very Best</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is synonymous with challenge, difficulty, and gruelling FPS-fuelled intensity. It’s one of the toughest games on the market, and it doesn’t hold the hand of new players <strong>one bit</strong>. While SPT is a little complex to get running, it offers unparalleled customisation opportunities for players who want to have a different experience free from the risk of potentially running into other gamers.</p>



<p>This new mod (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/someones-added-collectible-pokemon-cards-to-escape-from-tarkov-single-player-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dug up by Destructoid</a>) brings a quirky cosmetic pack into Escape from Tarkov SPT. It’s called Collectables: Pokémon Cards, and when twinned with the <a href="https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2132-collectables-pok%C3%A9mon-cards/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collectables: Card Case Mod</a>, it becomes a mission for players to go out and catch ’em all. It’s impossible to know when you’ll stumble upon a card, and as they’re randomised, it could theoretically take weeks to find them all – provided you’re searching in every container and corner of the game.</p>



<p>Trading card packs and the unique cards themselves have been added to the game as 3D renders, which means you can preview them in all their replicated glory in the item menu. Given how rigorously Nintendo defends its IP, it might only be a matter of time before the mod is ordered to be taken down, but until then, it’s live and ready to be enjoyed by gamers everywhere.</p>

Games has officially acquired Player First Games, adding the developer behind MultiVersus to its profile.</p><p>In an official release sent to IGN, Warner Bros. confirmed that co-founder Tony Huynh and Chris White will retain leadership of the studio, which has led development of the popular Smash Bros-like brawler. Multiversus officially launched in May following early access and open beta releases throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said in a release. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p><p>The announcement came ahead of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-season-2-to-add-samurai-jack-and-beetlejuice-ranked-mode-arrives-next-week">release of MultiVersus Season 2</a>, which is set to go live tomorrow. In addition to ranked mode, the new season will add Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. They join a host of other Warner Bros. characters, including Agent Smith, Joker, and more.</p><p>Reviews of MultiVersus have been mostly positive since its release, with our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review-open-beta">own review stating</a>, "MultiVersus is a raucous and fun competitive platform fighter that rewards players for learning the strengths and weaknesses of its eclectic cast of characters and working as part of a team. Its focus on online 2v2 means it lacks the pick-up-and-play nature of a game like Smash Bros., but it also does a nice job of setting it apart from other games in the genre. MultiVersus may need time to grow its currently limited selection of stages and characters to meet its bright potential, but its foundations are already rock solid."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Warner Bros. Games president David Haddad said in a statement, "We have worked with Player First Games over several years to create and launch MultiVersus, and we are very pleased to welcome this talented team to Warner Bros. Games. The bright and creative team at Player First Games adds to our extensive development capabilities."</p><p>Player First Games joins a studio line-up that also includes NetherRealm Studios, TT Games, Monolith Productions, and Avalanche Software. Warner Bros. Games was recently hit by layoffs amid the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-mobile-game-to-shut-down-a-year-after-launch-as-developer-netherrealm-suffers-layoffs">closure of its Mortal Kombat: Onslaught mobile game</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League also struggling since release</a>. Despite that, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wb-games-says-it-plans-to-double-down-on-live-service-despite-suicide-squad-failing-to-meet-expectations">Warner Bros. Games has said it will continue to double down on live service games</a>, which includes MultiVersus.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

As you follow the winding paths along the snow-capped peaks, you'll eventually reach the Foot of the Forge Site of Grace. Just beyond, you'll see a red-haired titan who awaits you in its arena.</p><h3 id="General_tips_when_facing_the_Fire_Giant">General tips when facing the Fire Giant</h3><ul><li>The Fire Giant is one of the largest bosses in Elden Ring. Expect its attacks to be slow and cumbersome, while packing quite a punch.</li><li>Most blows will take out a chunk of your health. We recommend being level 115 or higher, with at least 40 points in Vigor. (Note that 60 Vigor is the ideal cap that you should reach.)</li><li>Additionally, talismans that increase your HP, such as the Crimson Amber Medallion and Erdtree's Favor, are viable as well.</li><li>As the name implies, the Fire Giant does have several fire-based abilities. The Flamedrake Talisman (or other higher-tier variants) is an extremely useful accessory to have.</li><li>Similarly, you can make use of spells like Flame Fortification or Flame Protect Me, as well as the Fireproof Dried Liver consumable.</li><li>In our case, we preferred the Eleonora's Poleblade to inflict the bleed status effect, though many other armaments should suffice. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-best-weapons-tier-list-per-type/2900-5612/" data-ref-id="2900-5612"><strong>best weapons guide</strong></a>.</li><li>Alexander can be summoned as an NPC ally, but his summon sign is in the boss arena itself. You may also use spirit ash summons, preferably the Mimic Tear, Black Knife Tiche, Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff, and other single entity specters that are armored or are fast enough.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336511"></a><figcaption>Mount up on Torrent to get closer to the Fire Giant, but be sure to avoid its devastating plate sweep attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336511-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Fire_Giant_boss_fight__Phase_1">Fire Giant boss fight: Phase 1</h3><p>The start of the Elden Ring Fire Giant boss fight is actually the most pivotal moment in the whole encounter. The arena is vast and this behemoth is far in the distance. Ideally, you should ride Torrent to close the gap, but beware of the boss' plate sweep attack. This attack can kill Torrent and your character outright. However, if you double-jump on Torrent at the right time, you should be able to avoid taking damage.</p><p>From here, it's imperative that you fight the Fire Giant on foot--its melee/physical damage abilities can kill Torrent and you don't want to waste your flasks reviving your trusty horse. The idea is to focus on its left leg, hitting it continuously until your foe kneels in anguish. Here are some other things to watch out for:</p><ul><li>If you're locking on to the Fire Giant's left leg and you see the monster lifting it up, that means it will smash the ground with its metal plate. Make sure you roll to avoid this crushing blow.</li><li>Speaking of rolling, the Fire Giant will sometimes roll to reposition. Don't forget to close the gap when it does.</li><li>The boss will launch a large, slow-moving fireball. You can let it get close enough until it pulses, then run away before it detonates.</li></ul><h3 id="Fire_Giant_boss_fight__Phase_2">Fire Giant boss fight: Phase 2</h3><p>At roughly 50% HP, a cutscene will show the Fire Giant breaking off its leg and offering it as a sacrifice. From here, it becomes less mobile but it does gain a few new abilities:</p><ul><li>The boss will shoot out two slow-moving fireballs this time. You can still go near them and quickly run away to trigger their explosion. Aside from this, it also launches fast-moving fireballs in a straight line.</li><li>It will belch out multiple burning rocks that explode once they hit the ground. This ability tends to have a long cast time.</li><li>Fire pillars will also erupt around it as it's kneeling.</li></ul><p>During the second phase, your best bet is to mount up on Torrent and stay behind it. You can then use your melee weapon to strike its right leg (i.e. the one that it didn't break off). This can take a while since this isn't its weak spot, so make sure your preferred melee weapon is upgraded.</p><p>Alternatively, those who prefer ranged combat or spellcasting should focus on the Fire Giant's hands (i.e. the actual weak spots). This can be riskier since you have to avoid several projectiles. However, you can use the trees or rocks as cover, but watch out if they get destroyed. Lastly, if the boss gets staggered, you can run up to it to deal critical damage to its eye.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336512-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4336512-elden-ring-fire-giant-boss-how-to-beat-fire-giant-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336512"></a><figcaption>For melee fighters, it's better to stay behind the Fire Giant so you can keep hitting its leg during the second phase.

		<p>A major new free update for Sker Ritual has been released by Wales Interactive, and it is called House of the Damned. The House of the Damned content leads with a new map, which this content drop is named after, but that’s not all. There’s new weapons and cosmetics to get your hands on too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sker Ritual - House of the Damned Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qW-SLp-qH6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One the new weapons in Sker Ritual will be The Rattler, which unlocks when the new standard weapon, Pistolet Stamped SMG, reaches Tier 3. The new special weapon is called The Corpse Grinder, and it is exclusive to the House of the Damned map, though some may get lucky in different maps to wield it. It’s essentially a shredder that cuts through flesh and bone, but it can only be accessed after completing the main EE mission. There will be 20 free new rewards added to the Sker Pass, on top of a premium DLC pack. This premium DLC pack will include two wolf masks, a black and white animated menu background, a new voiceline, and a premium emblem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/20/sker-ritual-takes-the-world-of-sker-in-a-new-and-unexpected-direction/">Sker Ritual takes the world of Sker in a new and unexpected direction</a></h2>
<p>Sker Ritual is a spin off from Maid of Sker, swapping the atmospheric horror for a wave based first person shooter. Steve played Sker Ritual and said, <em>“Sker Ritual is a completely unexpected game in almost all regards and that includes how much fun it is. I was fully expecting to find the shift to wave-based shooting a betrayal of everything that made Maid of Sker distinctive and interesting, but the actual experience of Ritual is just simple shooting fun and I found myself enjoying it a lot.”</em></p>

Did you hear that? That’s the sound of the internet collectively crying out at what could have been, as we are yet again reminded of the fact that modern movies are far too scared of sex and sexuality.<br></p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisters-2024-trailer-sequel-remake-super-bowl-1851249701&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisters-2024-trailer-sequel-remake-super-bowl-1851249701">semi-sequel based on the action/disaster movie from 1996</a></span> (which ends with a kiss between stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton, BTW), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisters-movie-2024-release-glen-powell-tornado-1851589981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisters-movie-2024-release-glen-powell-tornado-1851589981"><em>Twisters</em></a></span> is about several disparate groups of storm-chasers chasing tornadoes during a record outbreak in Oklahoma. Edgar-Jones plays Kate, a fairly buttoned-up former chaser who lived through tragedy and stopped going out in the field, while Powell is Tyler Owens the tornado wrangler—half cowboy, half meteorologist, who drives a souped-up pickup truck directly into tornado funnels so he can shoot fireworks off in them.<br></p><p>The two are drawn to each other almost immediately, and are brought closer together by their love of tornadoes and their desire to help protect the people who are devastated by them. Tyler shows up at Kate’s motel after a day of storm-chasing and takes her to a rodeo, then uses his body as a human shield to protect her when a tornado hits in the middle of the night. He figures out where she lives (and for some reason, it’s not creepy), and shows up there, too, to try and convince her to pick her scientific studies back up. He’s polite and charming with her mother and looks at her like the entire world lies behind her eyes—the man is smitten, and it’s obvious to us all.<br></p><p>There is yearning there, and a desire to support her research and help her flourish. This is the kind of man we dream about! By the end of the movie, when Kate heads to the airport to fly back to New York where she currently lives, Tyler illegally parks to rush in and tell her how he feels (“if you feel it, chase it!”). As she turns to him, her eyes cast upward, you can almost feel their heart rates increase in tandem—it’s time for them to kiss. Except they don’t. They smile and walk away together after an announcement is made that severe weather is causing flight delays (the only solace I can find in this scene is that Tyler appears to take Kate’s suitcases in a “you’re coming home with me” kinda vibe). In the few days since <em>Twisters</em>’ release, the internet has discovered footage of the kiss and almost universally lamented that it was left on the cutting room floor.<br></p><p>“The most powerful move Kamala could make right now is to come out in strong opposition to cutting the kiss from <em>Twisters</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/claykeller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/claykeller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote Clay Keller on X</a></span> (formerly Twitter). “RELEASE THE TWISTERS KISS CUT,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kelsospade/status/1815066927217205748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kelsospade/status/1815066927217205748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demanded a Glen Powell fan account</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sydglenx/status/1814705848645533812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sydglenx/status/1814705848645533812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another Glen Powell fan account urged us</a></span> to “always remember what they took from us” along with a video of the kiss in question.<br></p><p>Edgar-Jones explained the reasoning behind the kiss getting cut to <em>Collider</em>, saying, “I think it’s a Spielberg note, wasn’t it? Do you know what it is? I think it stops the film feeling too cliched, actually. I think there’s something really wonderful about it feeling like there’s a continuation. This isn’t the end of their story. They’re united by their shared passion for something.”<br></p><p>Powell agreed, saying, “I also think that this movie is not about them finding love. It’s returning Kate to the thing that she loves, which is storm chasing. So that’s what you have at the end of the movie. They share this thing, and her passion is reinvigorated, and her sense of home is reinvigorated. I feel like a kiss would be sort of unrepresentative of the right goal at the end of the movie. And it is a good Spielberg note. It’s why that kid is still in this game. It’s amazing.”<br></p><p>But I must ask: porque no los dos? Can we not have a strong, powerful, independent woman who just made a scientific breakthrough in tornado physics make out with a very hot, smart man who adores her? Girl bosses need love, too. Bring back the kiss cut!<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
