            <p>
Nintendo's 135-year history will soon be brought to life inside the walls of a new purpose-built Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, Tokyo - and ahead of its opening on 2nd October, legendary designer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has revealed some of its intriguing exhibits in a new video tour.
</p>
<p>
The Nintendo Museum has been built on the site of the factory where Nintendo originally made its Hanafuda cards, and which was later used for quality checks during the Famicom era. That building and its unremarkable carpark is no longer standing, though, now replaced by a shiny two-floor monument to Nintendo's history and a Mario-themed plaza.
</p>
<p>
Miyamoto's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc">13-minute tour</a> begins on the second floor of the museum, where several huge curved glass displays - containing many of the products Nintendo has released since its founding in 1889 - can be found. This whole area is intended to chart the evolution of Nintendo's approach to entertainment, from its earlier non-video game products - including copy machines, baby strollers, RC cars, and pitching machines - into more familiar territory, beginning with 1977's early video game forays, the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15.

<p>
From there, the video game stuff begins in earnest, with Miyamoto highlighting exhibits showcasing different iterations of Nintendo's games and consoles from all across the world, displays charting how the graphics of its most beloved franchises have changed over the years, the evolution of the ? block, the history of titles played with the whole body, and more. It's a neat bit of (presumably educational) nostalgia, but the niftiest stuff appears to be reserved for the museum's first floor.
</p>
<p>
Here, Nintendo has created eight activities reimagining some of its earliest products for the modern era. There's a giant screen on the floor where visitors can play the traditional Japanese game card game Hyakunin Isshu using a smart device, and recreations of Japanese homes where guests can pick up a foam baseball bat and try batting away balls from an Ultra Machine DX pitching machine - the twist being that objects in the room come to life, bottles spinning and printers printing, as balls bounce into them.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Then there's the Zapper &amp; Scope SP exhibit, inspired by Nintendo's Laser Clay bowling alley shooting galleries of the 70s. This reworking of the experience sees up to 13 players - armed with either NES Zappers or SNES Super Scopes - blasting Mario-themed targets as the likes of Shy Guys and Koopas dance and spin across a huge horizontal screen, all in a battle for the highest score. And Miyamoto's final video tour stop takes him to room where guests can play classic Nintendo games from the Famicon to Wii era - but only using comedically huge controllers requiring multiple people to coordinate their inputs.
</p>
<p>
And that's alongside other interactive experiences not showcased in Nintendo's video but <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en">briefly detailed on its website</a>, including exhibits inspired by the Ultra Hand, Love Tester, Game &amp; Watch, and more. Other activities include an area to play Hanafuda, workshops where guests can make their own Hanafuda cards, a cafe, and a shop selling exclusive merchandise.

                <p>Arguably the coolest Nintendo Lego set, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, had been unavailable at Amazon earlier this month (a common occurrence), but now it's back in stock--and with a <em>slight </em>discount as well. Normally $270, Amazon's latest restock shaves the price to $262. While a savings of $8 isn't much, at least it's something considering we actually have <em>never </em>seen a discount on the Lego NES at Amazon. In the event that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> sells out again, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can also find it at Target</a> for the same price.</p><p>If you thought this Lego set could be purchased for less than $270 at one point, you'd be correct. Released in 2020 with a launch price of $230, the Lego NES was one of many sets that received substantial price hikes in 2022. For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all. Major retailers--sometimes all of them--are constantly sold out of the Lego NES.</p><p>It's not the only hard-to-find Lego Nintendo set. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block</a> has disappeared from most retailers this year, and Lego retired the $200 building kit in July. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good/1100-6525901/" data-ref-id="1100-6525901">Amazon just restocked this set as well</a>--perhaps for the last time.</p><h2>Lego Nintendo Entertainment System</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352624"></a><figcaption>Lego Nintendo Entertainment System</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352624-lego-nes.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li></ul><p>Lego's take on Nintendo's iconic console doesn't just include a buildable version of the machine, it also throws in all the pieces you'll need to build an old-school CRT TV and stand, NES controller, and a Super Mario Bros. NES cartridge as well. The end result is a surprisingly intricate display piece, full of interactive elements like a working cartridge slot, rotating dials on the CRT TV, and a crank-operated screen that emulates a Super Mario level. It also has a very charming secret that will delight long-time fans.</p><p>This is one of only a handful Lego Nintendo display pieces on the market--the playsets are wildly different--and if you're looking to get the complete collection or spoil a Lego fan in your life, you can't go wrong with the handful of other kits currently available.</p><h2>Lego Nintendo Display Sets</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615"></a><figcaption>Lego Super Mario Question Block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon</a> (2,064 pieces) -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi at Target (1,215 pieces)</a> -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $270 | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6379558-Super-Mario-The-Mighty-Bowser-71411-Building-Toy-Set%2F321283899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranaha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $60 price</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgreat-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-nes-restocked-at-amazon-gets-exceedingly-rare-small-discount%2F1100-6525902%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Zelda - The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 (2,500 pieces)</a> -- $300</li></ul><p>Mighty Bowser is quite expensive at $270--but it is gigantic when fully constructed--so as a Koopa King alternative, we'd recommend the adorable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Bowsers-Muscle-Expansion-Collectible/dp/B0CGY1MQFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Bowser Muscle Car</a> for a cute and compact take on the Mario Rival.

Its single dungeon, evil monsters, creepy town, and loot-filled catacombs forever changed the action RPG genre. Today, the OG <em>Diablo </em>might seem a bit small and simple compared to the wild open-world adventure we find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">2023's <em>Diablo 4</em></a></span><em>. </em>But <em>Diablo’s </em>vibes are still unmatched by any of its sequels, and now you can experience the classic ARPG for free on your phone or PC browser. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-can-play-the-original-and-best-version-of-diablo-in-your-browser-again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/you-can-play-the-original-and-best-version-of-diablo-in-your-browser-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new website has popped up</a></span> that lets you play the shareware version of the original <em>Diablo </em>in your browser. This new web-based port of the game was built using <em>Diablo’s </em>original source code, which was previously reconstructed by GalaXyHaXz and the Devilution team and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be found on GitHub</a></span>. </p><p>Now, keep in mind that unless you own <em>Diablo </em>and upload the “DIABDAT.MPQ” file, you won’t have access to everything found in the retail release. Still, the shareware version of <em>Diablo</em> lets you play as a warrior who can’t talk to NPCs, but can kill demons and loot weapons in the dungeon under the church in Tristram. </p><p>In my testing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this browser-based port of <em>Diablo</em></a></span><em> </em>plays really well. I had no issues exploring the dark corridors and killing zombies and skeletons. Just toss your old <em>Diablo </em>save and DIABDAT.MPQ file onto a service like Google Drive or a USB stick and you can play Blizzard’s seminal ARPG anywhere with an internet connection. </p><p>In fact, you could be playing <em>Diablo </em>right now on the device you are currently using instead of working or reading the last sentence of this blog. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Stealth 700 sounds a little more rudimentary than that (though also much less finicky), but its specs are pretty robust with 60mm drivers that are 10mm larger than the last-gen model, simultaneous Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity for phone / Discord use, spatial audio, a noise-canceling microphone (that apparently uses “AI”), and a claimed 80 hours of battery life. </p><p>The dedicated PC model offers higher 24-bit / 96kHz audio and a 16-bit / 32kHz mic, as the current consoles are limited to 16-bit / 48kHz for audio and 16-bit / 16kHz for mics. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption><em>All three versions of the Stealth 700 Gen 3 will be available in black, with the Xbox variant also offered in cobalt and the PlayStation model offered in white.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Turtle Beach</cite></p></div></div><p>Another strange connectivity anomaly is that the Xbox version is cross-compatible with PlayStation / PC, but the PlayStation and PC models don’t work with Xbox (yet the PlayStation model works with PC, and the PC one works on PS5 / PS4). Microsoft and Sony’s proprietary licensing for their respective consoles likely plays a role in that bit of confusion — <em>fun</em>.</p><p>Nuanced compatibility restrictions aside, the new Stealth 700 sounds like a simple yet brute force method for a multiplatform gamer to use one headset across systems without constantly moving around a USB receiver or repairing Bluetooth. It’s definitely a little more flexible than the Astro A50 X’s demand that your headset be the central hub for all your systems, especially if your console and PC setups are in different rooms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s why I prepare so vigorously and why we only shoot finished screenplays. And <em>Supergirl</em>, which I’m not directing, is being handled the same way.

The whet your appetitive there is a free demo available right now on both stores, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi-demo-c289c2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for EGS,</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2738000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s the link for Steam. </a></p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI “DELIVERANCE” - PC Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_2WT_0m0dsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As usual there are a couple of variations of the release.&nbsp; Final Fantasy XVI Standard Edition &nbsp;includes the base game, or the Complete Edition &nbsp;includes the exciting DLC chapters “Echoes of the Fallen” and “The Rising Tide” at a discounted price. You can also buy the DLC chapters individually or as part of the Final Fantasy XVI Expansion Pass, which includes both chapters. All of these will be available on launch day.</p>
<p>If you pre-oder the game on either Steam or the Epic Games Store will also receive the following in-game DLC items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Blade Weapon</li>
<li>Cait Sith Charm (Gil Boost Accessory)</li>
<li>“Sixteen Bells” Orchestrion Roll</li>
</ul>
<p>The game originally launched in June 2023 on PlayStation 5 and we gave it a whopping<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/21/final-fantasy-16-review/"> 9/10 in our review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>“If you’re a fan of strong narrative experiences, Final Fantasy lore, breath-taking graphics and a particularly sassy Moogle, and you don’t mind a sprinkling of The Witcher, The Handmaids Tale and the many accents of Old Blighty, then Final Fantasy XVI is the game for you,” said Nic. “Heck, it might just be the best Final Fantasy yet!”</p>

<p>If you need even more convincing you should get the game then let me remind you it won our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year foe 2023</a>.</p>
<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

<p>Following the game’s most recent update, in which developer Starbreeze Studios released the Houston Breakout DLC, featuring a brand-new heist, tailor pack, and weapon pack, if you purchase the entire Chapter 3 bundle, some players cannot join a lobby. It’s becoming more widespread with each passing minute. Here are some potential fixes for the failed to fetch game config in Payday 3!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-failed-to-fetch-game-config-in-payday-3">How to (Potentially) Fix Failed to Fetch Game Config in Payday 3</h2>



<p>If you’re among the many suffering from this bug that’s plagued the game since its launch, you’re not alone in dealing with it today. Countless players cannot get into a game because of the “game config” error in Payday 3. While not guaranteed, here are a few potential fixes for the problem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Create an entirely new Starbreeze account and link it to your game via Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation.</li>



<li>Verify the game files on Steam by right-clicking the game in your library, selecting Properties, then Installed Files, and then “verify integrity of game files.” It will need to check every file, so be patient!</li>



<li>If that doesn’t work, delete the contents of the % appdata%LocalPAYDAY3 folder and attempt to verify the game files once more.</li>



<li>Attempt to log in repeatedly until it connects.</li>
</ul>



<p>While certainly not ideal, some of these fixes may help you finally check out the new content in the Houston Breakout DLC!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-the-game-config-error-in-payday-3">What Causes the Game Config Error in Payday 3?</h2>



<p>It’s unclear precisely what causes the failed to fetch game config error in Payday 3. Some users report it as a problem with their internet connection. More often than not, however, it’s on Starbreeze’s end. It’s not your fault.</p>



<p>Even worse, Starbreeze has not yet addressed the problem, as far as we’ve seen. Many experienced it on launch day, and here we are, nearly a year later, with the problem persisting for many players.</p>



<hr>



<p>Payday 3 is a bit of a mess, especially considering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze fired its CEO</a>, but we’re hopeful the team can turn things around and create a cooperative heist game for the ages!</p>
