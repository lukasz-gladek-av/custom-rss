            <p>The GamesIndustry.biz HR Summit will return for a second year, and this time at the prestigious Royal Institution in London.</p>
<p>The event will take place on September 18th, and will now run all day, concluding with the 2024 Best Places To Work Awards. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/gamesindustrybiz-hr-summit-2024-tickets-906793512807?aff=oddtdtcreator">Early Bird tickets are on sale now and priced at £130 (+ fees).</a></p>
<p>This year’s event will tackle the biggest issues facing HR professionals today, covering team morale during deeply uncertain times, the impact of AI, diversity and inclusion (including neurodiversity), leadership, mental health, hybrid and remote working and more.</p>
<p>Our first confirmed speakers for the event include Emma Smith from Hestia Talent, Sarah Brewster of FreshSeed, Sarah Sorrell from Safe In Our World, Sheila Attwood of Brightmine and Tommy Thompson from AI and Games, with many more to be announced.</p>
<p>Last year’s event at BAFTA was a complete sell out, and we will be building on that show with more roundtable-style sessions, plus breakout spaces and networking opportunities.</p>

							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Xbox Game Studios</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Cambridge-based game developer Ninja Theory has produced praiseworthy yet commercially unsuccessful games for most of its history, ever since the days of Kung Fu Chaos, a 3D fighting party game made exclusively for the original Xbox console.</p>
<p>The same was true for Heavenly Sword, an action/adventure developed for Sony as a PlayStation 3 exclusive, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, a multiplatform release published by Bandai Namco, and DmC: Devil May Cry, which was also controversial among fans for the changes it made to the beloved CAPCOM series.</p>
<p>Ironically, Ninja Theory found its big break when it opted to self-publish a game for the first time. I'm talking, of course, about Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, which the studio devised as a so-called 'independent triple-A' game. The game only took three months to break even, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hellblade-senua-sacrifice-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its stellar reviews</a> attracted Microsoft to the UK studio at a time when they were looking to increase the size of Xbox Game Studios. For its part, Ninja Theory clearly understood that despite the success of Hellblade, financial trouble was just a failed project away. They, like other independent studios in a similar position (Obsidian, inXile, Double Fine Productions), chose the (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged</a>) security of having such a big parent company.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, Ninja Theory released the multiplayer online action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleeding Edge</a>. However, it wasn't received well, and development was shut down less than a year after launch.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By then, the studio had already unveiled Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, the sequel to its most acclaimed game, at The Game Awards 2019. Between the first game and this announcement, Sony Santa Monica released the massively successful God of War reboot, also heavily rooted in Norse mythology and very much narrative-driven. Many Xbox fans initially hoped Senua's Saga: Hellblade II would borrow some things from God of War, especially when it comes to size and scope.</p>
<p>However, having played and finished Ninja Theory's first-ever sequel, I can tell you that despite the long development, the studio made the interesting choice of keeping the same short length. The game will last between six to seven hours, largely depending on how quick you are with solving the environmental puzzles that are dispersed throughout Senua's journey.</p>
<p>Its structure is also virtually the same. This is an extremely linear affair where players only have very limited exploration and interactivity with the environment. Sometimes, they can discover totem-like structures that provide bits of lore on the world designed by the development team, but that's it. There are no upgrades or new gear to be found nor resources to be gathered.</p>
<p>Combat is also largely unchanged from the first game, consisting entirely of one-on-one fights. You can perform many of the same moves: dodge, parry/block, light attack, and heavy attack. Actually, for some reason, Senua no longer has the kick move, which is a shame since her enemies sometimes use quick slaps and the like. Anyway, there's also still the same mirror item that allows her to focus and slow time for a few seconds.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-08-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like the original, the game is entirely HUDless. In this sequel, Ninja Theory went one step further and delivered Senua's Saga: Hellblade II in a cinematic 2.39:1 aspect ratio, which means there are black bars on regular 16:9 displays, just like you'd find in most movies.</p>
<p>That is all to say, in most ways, this is really more of an experience than a game. Each step of Senua's brief journey acquires meaning thanks to the constant introspection enabled by her inner voices, once again one of the highlights of the experience. They are a reflection of her psychosis, yes, sometimes inciting her to press on and be strong, but just as often expressing her self-doubts and fear of failure. But they also serve as constant commentary on what's happening around Senua.</p>
<p>In Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, though, the protagonist isn't just left to deal with her own ghosts. There are real people Senua encounters and befriends once she gets to Iceland. Her objective quickly changes after she learns what's truly going on in this dark, forsaken, yet beautiful land. In her quest to free the people of Iceland from the giants, Senua has three companions: Thórgestr, Fargrímr, and Ástríðr, each with their own well-defined personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it would be a crime to spoil (besides the fact that it is forbidden by the review embargo guidelines) the story since it is so vital to this game, so I'll just say that it deals gracefully with universal themes like what loss, pain, and grief can to do a person. There's also Senua's own path to accepting her own inner darkness as well as dealing with the ever-present shadow of her past.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful, incredibly poignant story that anyone should experience for themselves. That is why I mentioned in the headline how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II might be the perfect Game Pass experience. Even gamers who would rather prefer a more traditional game are very likely to be driven to play it since it will be on the subscription service on day one. I certainly recommend it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On that note, Ninja Theory will assuredly get their latest work in the hands of many more users, which is great for this type of experience. However, I'm not so sure Microsoft will be just as happy with the return on investment, especially since Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is otherwise sold at $49 (instead of the original's $29) and is unlikely to set sales charts on fire. I expect Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will eventually release it on PlayStation consoles</a> to maximize profits.</p>
<p>I still have to discuss the audiovisual department. There's not much to say here except that it is absolutely stellar. Unreal Engine 5 is used to its full extent, with Nanite making a particularly impressive showcase of its virtual geometry in the impressive rendering of Iceland's rocky environments. The atmosphere and lighting are fantastic, although I found certain scenes to be a bit too dark, to the point where you literally had to increase the gamma to see anything.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, the game had only minimal stuttering. On an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, I could play with DLAA, DLSS Frame Generation at 4K resolution and max settings with around 80 frames per second on average, gaining around 30 frames thanks to Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The audio component is just as good. As with the original, the developers recommend playing the game with headphones for the best experience, but a good Dolby Atmos setup also works well to reproduce the voices and sounds that surround Senua. The voice acting is also excellent.</p>

<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</p>

Players' latest journey with Senua will take them far and wide across a landscape of turmoil among warring factions and mythological beasts. But how long will her adventure take to see it through to the end. Here's how long Hellblade 2 is.</p><h2>How long to beat Hellblade 2</h2><p>Though its visual fidelity takes a big leap forward with arguably the best motion-capture work in video game history, the total time commitment to Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is about the same as the first game. That means you'll be able to complete it in roughly 5-8 hours on a normal playthrough. The game is very linear with only a few diversions that may take you off your path, including two types of lore-heavy collectibles. If you decide to go for all of those, expect to come in at the high end of that estimate, but it's likely you won't exceed it.</p>

<p>The only other thing that may extend your time with the game is a feature that unlocks once you complete the game for the first time.

Once you beat Hellblade 2, you'll unlock alternate narrators, meaning the story can be experienced with other characters narrating it.

			<p>Senua’s Saga – Hellblade II has a huge weight of expectation behind it. The sequel to an independent darling, whose AAA visuals disguised its small studio roots, its developer, Ninja Theory, was subsequently bought by Microsoft during its <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/10/microsoft-acquire-ninja-theory-playground-undead-labs-compulsion-games/">early raft of studio acquisitions</a>. And as the years have passed, Hellblade II has become one of Microsoft’s tentpole releases. The game used to announce the Xbox Series X, it’s then needed time to make good on both the original’s success and the sequel’s potential. Just like Senua, the game has had a tricky path to wend, but it’s found its way to release, with focus, willpower and sheer strength of spirit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. Animal Soul by AURORA)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRbOmIcVXak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/08/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review/">the original game,</a> Hellblade II prompts you to play the game with headphones to ensure you can make the most of the title’s incredible binaural audio. It also warns you of the content you’re going to experience, with a startling rendition of psychosis, graphic violence and an array of different trauma once again at the centre of this folkloric adventure. As someone whose family member found the original game’s content disturbing, and potentially triggered a mental health episode, it’s a warning that’s well worth considering.</p>


<p>We rejoin Senua’s tale as she has willingly given herself up to the Northmen, hoping to be taken to their leader to root out the evil that destroyed her home, family and love. However, her plan never reaches fruition, instead leaving her shipwrecked on the shores of a brutal land; half-mad, half-drowned, she crawls back onto land in search of the men who led her to this place.</p>


<p>Hellblade’s use of audio remains a trick that hasn’t been replicated, and here in the sequel, it’s an element that’s even stronger and more focused than before. Voices whisper in each ear, drifting in front and behind at times; sometimes feeling like an angel and a devil on each shoulder, at other points a storyteller or an antagonist. They’re comforting and vicious, condemning and cautious. They’re personal demons, and just as with the first game, you’re never sure what their true origin is. Are they internal or external, and what, exactly, is their purpose here?</p>
<p>While you continue to ask these questions, you can be certain that Hellblade II looks simply stunning on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a>. Once again, the team has made their game a showcase piece for Unreal Engine, and a big part of that is the motion capture and physical details of Senua herself. Her scarred features, her weariness, and her desperate strength are all depicted with an incredible level of fidelity. At times Hellblade II feels as much like an interactive animated movie as it does anything else.</p>
<p>One thing I had hoped for was more involved, or at least more precise combat, but so much of what is here feels scripted and prescribed rather than organic. There’s almost the illusion of control, but it seems as though Ninja Theory really want you to experience the tale they’ve weaved while punctuating it with bouts of hammering away at your controller’s buttons.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, all encounters can be beaten by dodging, parrying, or slowing time with your Focus, and once you’ve got the timing right they’re obstacles that you simply have to get through to move the story forward. It was my least favourite element of the original game, and it’s the same here.</p>

<p>It’s also not fully explained, leaving you to search out your way forward via disparate button presses and pattern watching until you’ve learned what it wants from you. If you haven’t played the first game, or you don’t traditionally opt for action titles, Hellblade II is unnecessarily unforgiving, though that in itself feels like an obvious design decision to put you ill at ease, and under yet more pressure. Fortunately, the atmosphere, narrative and presentation are absolutely stellar, and it’s these elements that Ninja Theory have nailed their reputation on, rather than the combat mechanics – if you find the combat a struggle, there’s a choice between an adaptive difficulty, and the usual Easy, Medium and Hard.</p>
<p>Everything about Hellblade II feels authentic, from the region-specific voice actors to the depiction of stone circles, monuments and settlements. Even the weaves within Senua’s hair look as you’d expect them to for the era, and despite the fantastical and psychological elements, Hellblade II feels like a historical journey to a specific moment in time, capturing both the benign and the brutal reality of this Nordic people’s way of life.</p>
<p>Despite the earlier warnings, they don’t truly prepare you for the graphic scenes and intense emotional pressure that Hellblade II puts you under. There is death here – a lot of bloody, visceral death – and it’s difficult to express the effect that it has on you and your psyche. The impact of what you’re experiencing as Senua is clearly impactful, and both her damaged mind and your own become intertwined through the horror you’re experiencing together.</p>

<p>While Hellblade II weaves its tale, the same location-specific puzzles return from the first game. At various points you’ll reach a gate, with sigils that appear within it being replicated in the nearby landscape. You have to focus on each element of the sigil to unlock it.</p>
<p>These have been made more accessible than in the original, with glyphs hanging in the air, and the elements you need to line up daubed in bright red inks/blood, but the puzzles feel as though they’re simply there to slow you down, rather than adding too much further meaning, beyond the continuous protestations of the voices.</p>
<p>Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.</p>
<p><em>We’re not quite ready to put a score on Hellblade II, but if you’re desperate to see a number, come back in the next couple days to see what we settle on.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/senua%E2%80%99s-saga-hellblade-ii-review-%E2%80%93-binaural-bedlam.876912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the first couple of minutes, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </em>overwhelms the senses. Crashing waves, thunderous rain, whimpering pleas for mercy; Ninja Theory’s got it all. And that’s all on top of the voices in your head.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-fear-is-mind-killer">sequel seven years in the making</a> amps up the scale, going for epic proportions of action and stakes. Instead of the deeply personal journey focused solely on Senua, Ninja Theory introduces a small cast of characters with their own motivations.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, this is Senua’s saga, and it’s wrapped in a highly polished production that’s as impressive as it is overwhelming, in a good way. Unfortunately, the narrative, while thought-provoking, ultimately doesn't quite stick the landing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-landscape-2.jpg?itok=hA03Moob 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-landscape-2.jpg?itok=OKC31ILS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As is cinematically appropriate, the game is rendered in this aspect ratio, even in a 16:9 window.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Technical Achievement</h2>

<p>When <em>Oppenheimer </em>hit theaters last summer, I distinctly remember two things about it: its serendipitous competition with <em>Barbie</em>, and the sheer power of experiencing a pseudo-nuclear explosion in an IMAX theater. It’s a visceral head-to-toe experience that easily stands out from the rest of the story, whether you liked it or hated it.</p>

<p><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> reaches that same level of technical prowess, really flaunting its ability to overwhelm you with its powerful, raw, and primal soundscape.</p>

<p>The game recommends using headphones, much like the previous game, and you’d be doing yourself a disservice playing it on speakers. I primarily used the <a href="https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/razer-blackshark-v2-pro-review-its-scary-good">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a>, and it created this sense of immediacy, intimacy, and immersion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat.jpg?itok=FCDuq_D7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat.jpg?itok=MQwRVpB0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is rendered in-engine during combat.</figcaption></figure><p>The Furies, the voices in Senua’s head, make a return, and they play roles both for gameplay and narrative. They’ll hint at how to solve puzzles or attack enemies, but also provide insight into narrative moments.</p>

<p>It’s never straightforward, though. Sometimes, they’ll say what just happened; other times, they’ll doubt someone’s intent. Or they’ll double back and doubt their own doubts. They’ll mock Senua for trusting a character or mock her for not listening to another. Sometimes, they’ll even cheer her on.</p>

<p>These Furies are a symptom of Senua’s psychosis. She perceives the world differently, hearing voices others don’t and seeing things others don’t see. That’s brought to life by the world literally shifting in front of your eyes, turning majestic scenes into menacing terrors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-photo-mode.jpg?itok=CNWphjhc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-photo-mode.jpg?itok=BbW65RSy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those bodies in the water don't really exist (I think). They're one of Senua's visions that you have to live through.</figcaption></figure><p>The reality-bending warps feel even more intense with the audio design, and the sheer beauty of the graphics really delivers breathtaking scene after scene. Picturesque vistas stretch to the horizon, while all the cutscene camera work frames everything with the right amount of suspense and drama.</p>

<p>The facial animations stand out among the competition as well. In the prequel, it was just Senua’s face, especially her eyes, that impressed me. That lifelike fidelity has been upgraded and applied for most other major characters here, really selling the key emotional moments here.</p>

<p><em>Hellblade II</em> really isn’t much of a video game. It’s a cinematic experience. It’s a feast for the senses, especially your ears.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-closeup.jpg?itok=-z-Z0mw_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-closeup.jpg?itok=G4xxfiT9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Clashing Blades, Piercing Screams</h2>

<p>Where the audio comes most to life is in combat. The gameplay takes a primarily over-the-shoulder view, like the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation"><em>God of War</em> games</a>.</p>

<p>What kept me most engaged was the sheer emotion behind every one of Senua’s battle cries. Vengeance, fury, desperation, exhaustion; it all comes through actress Melina Juergens’s performance.</p>

<p>Fights are one on one, and after taking care of one enemy, another appears, usually with some canned animations of them interacting with another character or grabbing Senua. It’s a neat effect that really adds to that cinematic feeling, though it does get predictable partway through.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-finisher.jpg?itok=sKDjQMpI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-finisher.jpg?itok=VQ2JIH-3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You use light attacks, heavy attacks, dodges, and blocks to beat enemies. You can also build up and burn meter to attack faster. It’s pretty standard action game combat, and there are accessibility options to literally make the combat encounters play themselves.</p>

<p>Aiding the simple approach to gameplay is the elevated animations. It’s a lot like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/uncharted-4-thiefs-end"><em>Uncharted 4</em>’s melee combat</a>, where the animations react to the context between Senua and her enemy. But these ones are brutal, definitely not for the faint of heart. I saw a few repeat, and they made me flinch every time.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-4.jpg?itok=OIXeMb6o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-4.jpg?itok=L2FPA_Vf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Nuanced Story That Falls a Little Flat</h2>

<p>Between combat encounters, <em>Hellblade II</em> plays a lot like a walking simulator, much like its predecessor. There are some light puzzling and occasional collectibles off the beaten path, but for the most part, you’re holding forward on the stick and occasionally hitting A to climb or interact.</p>

<p>While that sounds boring, that’s also prime opportunity for the narrative to develop. These quieter moments are when the Furies sow seeds of hope and doubt in Senua’s mind. It’s when the supporting cast tells Senua about the ways of the world and the giants who terrorize it.</p>

<p>For a narrative as dense as this, these moments let them breathe. There are a lot of allegories here; <em>Hellblade II</em> has a lot to say about societal power structures, family ties, religion, mental health, and hero worship.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-torch.jpg?itok=OK2wanTl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-torch.jpg?itok=dYSu_it8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>However, there were just enough times when I was really aware that all I was doing was holding forward on the stick. I know that’s the conceit of narrative-heavy games like this, but I did find myself getting bored on occasion.</p>

<p>These moments usually come from when Senua’s alone. As a leading character, she’s a woman of few words, which leads to lots of one-sided exchanges with the voices in her head. Even with other characters, she sometimes doesn’t answer their questions.</p>

<p><em>Hellblade II</em> offers her more opportunities to play off other people, which is an intrinsic way for us to understand her. But because of her standoffish nature, it doesn’t quite feel like she connects with any of them, even when the narrative implies a deeper bond.</p>

<p>Despite playing as her, I rarely found myself understanding her motivations and emotions other than suffering. She gets hurt a lot, physically and emotionally, and that’s most of the impression I’m walking away with. It’s almost miserable at times.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-cutscene-1.jpg?itok=zlapb7nm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-cutscene-1.jpg?itok=6pYAOL3H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lots of pivotal story moments are explained as you walk a lit-up path while watching ghosts of the past act out history. A narrator will explain what’s going on, too. For a game that prioritizes cinematic storytelling, I can’t help but feel like these moments could have been more engaging than simply walking after ghosts.</p>

<p>I won’t spoil the ending of course, but it did leave me wanting more—and not in a good way. It feels abrupt and unresolved.</p>

<p>Completing the story unlocks an alternate mode where other characters will narrate, which is a neat way to add more context and encourage more playthroughs. However, even revisiting the last chapter with extra narration, I didn’t find myself feeling much better about the end.</p>

<p>On technical achievement alone, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> stands out as one of the better titles under Xbox’s banner. Environments are awe-inspiring, faces are jaw dropping, and combat is intensely visceral.</p>

<p>There are a lot of thematic ideas to dissect in the story, and I found the last two chapters especially interesting in what they have to say. Unfortunately, the overall journey is punctuated with slower, almost boring moments, and its ending leaves a bit to be desired.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Senua’s saga is one I’d want to follow if we get more, but it’ll definitely be more for the technical presentation over Senua herself.</p>

  <p id="npjSck">Finding the <strong>hiddenfolk</strong> in <em>Hellblade 2</em> is a long process full of puzzles and visions. You’ll start this part of Senua’s journey shortly after the (long) walk to Fargrimr’s village and your first encounter with Illtauga. Fargrimr will send you off to find the Hiddenfolk and earn their favor during the end of chapter 3, “Raudholar” (well, “Rauðhólar”).</p>
<p id="BYpAba">To solve the puzzles, you’ll have to collect stone balls from nearby and return them to the puzzle’s central pillar. It’s not as straightforward as just walking around, though, and involves some mind-bending visuals.</p>
<p id="YHN8jO">Our <em>Hellblade 2</em> guide will show you <strong>where to find the carved stone balls</strong> in all three of the hiddenfolk puzzles.</p>

Take a right, duck under the rock you flipped earlier, and follow the path back to the third stone ball. There’s a ledge right next to it so you can drop down and finish the puzzle.</p>

  <p id="WLRBUF">It’s no surprise that, as a sequel, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> is bigger and more expansive than the previous game. Though this game’s scope, length, and subject are quite similar to those of the original Hellblade game — it is, of course, still an action-adventure dark fantasy about a warrior woman suffering from psychosis in ninth-century Northern Europe — much more effort has been put into making it appear grand and seamlessly cinematic. It’s an immaculately composed long take cropped to filmic widescreen. One result of this glow-up, however, is <em>Hellblade 2</em> losing a bit of what made the first game — much smaller, more focused, and more personal, by comparison — feel unique. </p>
<p id="XkXgxu">Hellblade-the-first, <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, begins and ends with its hero, Senua, mourning her murdered lover, missing her mother, and struggling to break out from under the mountain of guilt and shame handed down by her father. It’s a private and individually focused story. Senua spends the vast majority of the first game alone, with little but her delusions to accompany her.</p>
<p id="49gSCE">It feels small and cramped as a result. Senua, returning from a self-imposed exile, is shattered after learning about the slaughter of most of her village, and spends the rest of the game lashing out against manifestations of her guilty and traumatized memories. It ends with her conquering her personal demons, coming to an understanding about her own unique way of seeing the world, and promising to take this newfound understanding with her, on to new adventures.</p>

<p id="dJ6lmW">This is where we find Senua in <em>Hellblade 2</em>. She has allowed herself to be captured by the Northman slaver Thórgestr, and taken far away from Orkney to the rugged alien world of Iceland. The series’ focus has opened up, passing beyond oceans and across mountain ranges. It’s a travel story, following a small troupe of heroes as they hike across the rocky steppes and wave-beaten shores of this uncompromising landscape. It’s a Saga, a tall telling of Senua as freedom fighter, liberator of her kidnapped countrymen; Senua as giant slayer; Senua as gifted clairvoyant, who can peer beyond the veil.</p>

<p id="ODn5gE">Beyond feeling epic, the game is simply beautiful. It feels like every last boulder, pebble, tall patch of grass, and copse of trees has been carefully modeled and arranged. The broad sky cycles between ash-clouded overcast and brilliant, fiery red sunset and star-filled auroras of blue and violet. Senua climbs over windswept, rocky cliffs down to dark dripping caves lit by torchlight flickering off of prismatic rock, out across mist-drenched forests and through flame-ravaged settlements. Everything, from top to bottom, is rendered in immaculate detail. </p>
<p id="8bo0JX">By shifting the focus from the small and personal to the grand and epic, Ninja Theory wound up changing something fundamental about the series. Though we still hear the gallery of psychosis-generated voices who add commentary to Senua’s actions, they don’t feel as important to a story that is far more interested in what she’s <em>doing</em>, rather than what she’s thinking or how she’s feeling. Here, she’s taking on tremendous tasks and facing impossible odds, and the dramatic tension lies simply in whether she can accomplish what she’s set out to. It’s less nuanced than the first game, which exists in a constellation of trauma and memory and the ways in which her psychosis impacts her life. </p>

<p id="idKevR">In <em>Hellblade 2</em>, Senua’s psychosis begins to resemble something more anodyne, like a superpower, a tool with which to delve into secret aspects of the world that others cannot see. It’s like a mystical version of the “detective vision” made famous by the Rocksteady Batman games. No one can do anything to save themselves until Senua arrives. Her psychosis is embraced as a boon by everyone she meets. No one questions or challenges her mental state, in a marked contrast to how things went in the last game. Her father’s dripping evil baritone occasionally rings out to chastise her, but it’s quickly drowned out by her other, more supportive voices, as well as by the many pressing events the game shuttles between in rapid succession.</p>

<p id="eAsbqg">For Senua, this is, of course, a good thing. She’s moved beyond the pain and trauma; she’s advancing in the world, becoming a leader where she was once an outcast. Because of this, some of the air has, unfortunately, been let out of the experience. The dramatic experience of the game feels softer; there’s less to hold on to, less personal conflict to drive the plot forward.</p>
<p id="540SbX">Senua starts the game on a mission to free her fellow enslaved Orkneyites, but she almost immediately brings Thórgestr over to her side, before shifting to a slightly tangential, if far more epic, mission of saving the local people from an invasion of giants. Down this route lie more impressive visual spectacles: harrowing fights against massive giants, mind-altering voyages into magical realms, and far less of Senua herself. </p>
<p id="7PaFgF">In the first game, Senua would constantly react to the voices in her head and to the hallucinations that haunted her. In the sequel, we’ve moved from internal battles to external ones, and Senua has much less to react against. Instead, she’s drawn along by the game’s events, rarely hindered or held back, but thrust forward with prophetic inevitability.</p>

<p id="Ny1KvO">The external does offer plenty to find interest in, particularly in terms of the aesthetic experience. There’s something richer and more exciting about having to fight flesh-and-blood people this time around, rather than the illusory figures that haunted Senua in the first Hellblade. There’s a more grounded sense of terror in being hunted by real men with a hunger for violence in their eyes, and a stronger sense of the gravity of having to take a life, even in self-defense.</p>
<p id="4nvjsJ">One of the game’s early sections, where you must sneak into a settlement that’s under attack by a band of draugar, a bloodthirsty group of warriors, stands out as an experience of high tension. Senua must crawl through piles of corpses and severed limbs, and hide as the ones responsible for this bloodshed leap around howling, seeking out and grabbing helpless villagers right in front of her eyes. It’s a horrifying sequence, and one that distinguishes <em>Hellblade 2</em> from the first game, where the traumatic events had already happened long before Senua arrived (and was forced to reenact them in her mind). Bringing in other people — whole societies and cultures, eventually — enriches the game and makes it feel more alive, even as Senua herself comes across as more deadened.</p>
<p id="2UaRcR"><em>Hellblade 2</em> doesn’t ultimately maintain the energy level of these early sections. There are long stretches of basic environmental puzzles that involve Senua navigating around enclosed spaces in order to stand at different angles from which to view puzzling runes and unlock them. It’s an iteration of a mechanic that saw plenty of use in the first game. Here, while the puzzles are more visually impressive, the essence of the gameplay is identical. And it doesn’t add anything to the game that isn’t brought about more effectively by its more dynamic combat sections, or its more ruminative moments of exploration, during which Senua traverses this strange new world listening to the voices in her head alternately describing it and reacting to it.</p>

<p id="ksymUh">So much of Ninja Theory’s focus in <em>Hellblade 2</em> seems to be on pure spectacle. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/04/04/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-preview-studio-visit/">Xbox Wire post about the game</a> highlights the effort the creative team has put into stepping up the immersive feel, quoting studio head Dom Matthews: “We have a fantastic building; our performance capture stage, new technologies and techniques, but all of that exists to pursue the same goal. That goal is to create an experience that allows players to suspend their disbelief and immerse themselves fully in this world.”</p>

<p id="4QJTbL">Though there is arguably a degree to which having a head full of voices might prevent Senua and the player from ever being fully immersed in the game’s environment, the sense of verisimilitude is undeniable in <em>Hellblade 2</em>. Sprinting through enormous, terrifying fantastical spaces as Senua squares off against mythical enemies; fighting for her life as she is knocked back and forth between brutish warriors; clearing a battlefield, panting, her head still swinging wildly back and forth in search of further dangers — it all works as visual texture to make this game feel richly cinematic.</p>
<p id="18ARLN">But in all this spectacle, something of Senua herself is lost. Where the first game felt like a journey of self-discovery, both for Senua and for the player, <em>Hellblade 2</em> feels more invested in creating the myth of Senua: Senua as legendary giant slayer, as mystical seer touched by the underworld. There are moments where we do get glimpses at her actual humanity — in early chapters, where she is still struggling to survive and find her footing in this strange land, and in the denouements after later battles, where she falls to her feet, diminished, and mourns for those she was unable to save. But these moments are marginal to the central thrust of the narrative: a woman finding her place in the world; moving from a state of victimhood and isolation to one of heroic leadership; working to unite a people against their fears. It’s an inspiring story, and a hopeful one that seeks not to dwell in the mournful solemnity of the first game, instead pressing forward toward an impressively epic future. But, as with most epics, we only really get to see the broad strokes. We get the myth, but we lose the woman. </p>

But as I turn the next corner of clouding darkness, a bright red light paralyzes me as the forceful and commanding voice of my father tells me that not only am I doomed to fail in my struggles, but that I am actively causing the very harm I am seeking to alleviate. Be it through failure or a curse that he expects me to believe I carry with me that will spread to others, he calls me his daughter with a possessiveness that rattles me. It inspires fear and rage. Yet I continue to move forward, to find a way through, to find spaces where his corruption hasn’t spread. And I do this not only for myself, but for others to whom I have promised aid. But in my quest to kill godlike forces that are causing misery, I am ever aware of a creeping darkness that threatens to consume me and others. What must I do to heal this world? Is that  what I’m here to do? Can I do this? As I hear my father’s voice again, reminding me of his abuse, I realize I have no choice. I <em>must</em> survive and bring an end to the suffering of all those I encounter.</p><hr><p>Arriving on May 21, 2024 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> picks up shortly after the events of 2017’s <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>. Continuing the story of Senua, a Pictish warrior who experiences psychosis and has lived through intense and tragic trauma, <em>Saga</em> delivers an experience that will be familiar to those who played <em>Sacrifice</em>. <em>Saga</em> is a tightly focused narrative of magical realism, though those magical elements may largely be part of how Senua <em>perceives </em>the world, rather than how it actually is. (And really, how much can any of us can attest to how reality “actually” is?) Senua’s altered perceptions of reality enable her to contend with seemingly supernatural forces inspired by Norse mythology. But she also, and perhaps most importantly, is in a battle with her own trauma in a way that allows her to see into the internal struggles of others.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Senuas-Saga-Hellblade-Standard-Windows/dp/B0CWL1LQ85/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CWL1LQ85" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-recommend-id="image://1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-recommend-id="image://1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A third-person action-adventure game, <em>Saga</em> features cryptic mazes and puzzles typically solved by observing matching runic symbols and other methods of altering the world around Senua to traverse the environment. Long sequences of maze-drifting give way to moments that prioritize the game’s combat. Battles consist of one-on-one showdowns in which Senua must use her skills with a blade and her mirror, which grants her a limited bullet-time (or perhaps sword-time?) ability to deal rapid slashes against her opponent. </p><p>There are also plenty of lengthy cutscenes and “walk-and-talk” moments of exposition and dialogue, both from the three NPCs who accompany Senua on her journey and from the voices that speak to her in her mind, which are inspired by contemporary understandings of psychosis in the 21st century and produced in collaboration between developer Ninja Theory and experts in the field of psychosis and mental health. That experience is brought to life through a binaural audio design that necessitates playing this game with headphones. With headphones, the audio takes on outward and inward spatial roles: The world outside Senua sounds vividly real, and the internal sound of the voices she hears create distorted, gripping emotional contours over the narrative and virtually all other elements of the game.</p><p>In all of its elements, <em>Hellblade II</em> delivers numerous highs, and what many will find as some lows. Like the first <em>Hellblade</em>, the sequel has a run-time of about eight to nine hours. Though there is very little room for exploration outside of <em>Saga</em>’s main story, the game does reward another playthrough or two upon completion; you may replay the game with different characters narrating portions of the game’s story. It’s a neat and rewarding way to re-experience the game immediately after–and it does really help you connect many dots you might’ve missed on your first time through.</p><p>There’s also an additional unlockable feature rewarded for discovering all of the game’s hidden mythological lore lessons. Sadly, I cannot speak to this last element as, despite finishing the story in just under nine hours, I was unable to discover all of these hidden “collectibles.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-recommend-id="image://b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-recommend-id="image://b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Hellblade II</em> rarely failed to provide me with an emotionally stirring experience that ensnared my full attention and refused to let it go. And I didn’t want it to. I found it to be a riveting journey of lush, beautiful darkness and torment with a beating heart of hope and perseverance. It left a dramatic, if not haunting, impression on me, one that’s still capable of bringing me to tears as I make my way through it again with the alternate narration. </p><h2 id="h69343"><a id=""></a>Senua’s story continues</h2><p><em>Senua’s Saga</em> follows the warrior as she allows herself to be captured by Vikings who are rounding up Picts to be transported to Iceland as slaves. These captors are of the same militant force that slaughtered her village and her beloved, and her motivations are both a kind of revenge as well as a desire to prevent the continued suffering of her people. </p><p>Following her violent arrival in the north, Senua is introduced to additional characters and the central driving focus of the narrative: The people in Iceland live under the threat of unstoppable, menacing giants.</p><div><h4> Should you play <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em> before <em>Saga</em>?  </h4><div><p> Experiencing Senua’s first outing is only to your benefit as a player. Yes, there is a brief recap in <em>Saga</em> which you can also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/oSZpsmHIrV4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/oSZpsmHIrV4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch on YouTube</a></span>. That said, since neither game is very long at all, playing <em>Sacrifice</em>  for the first time or even revisiting it if you haven’t played it since  2017, makes for relatively light homework before diving into <em>Saga</em>. </p><p>&nbsp;What’s most valuable about experiencing<em> Sacrifice</em> before <em>Saga</em> is less the “lore” and more Senua’s emotional journey, which is one through trauma, not merely through a fictional landscape.  </p></div></div><p>Over the course of six chapters, Senua must persist through difficult trials that bend reality for her, and by extension, for you. Challenging you with solving cryptic puzzles strewn about its mazes, fighting a variety of tough foes in blade-to-blade combat, and dealing with its protagonist’s own inner turmoil, <em>Saga</em>’s premises are simple, but Senua herself is not. She experiences a persistent chatter from the “Furies,” voices she hears in her mind that narrate her decisions, question them, encourage her, doubt her, and offer up unpredictable lines of dialogue that take on different tones throughout the course of the game. </p><p>It can be a lot to sit with, and as you face vicious depictions of violence and human subjugation, the voices frequently turn to hold Senua accountable for everything around her. As a result, she experiences swallowing thought spirals of self doubt and failure which stem…yup, from her father.</p><figure id="" data-id="620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-recommend-id="image://620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-recommend-id="image://620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Her father is an abusive figure in her life. He persists in her mind and attempts to cast her as being responsible for the suffering she has endured, as well as that which she witnesses around her. </p><p>The end result is a dark and multidimensional narrative that shifts and shapes itself through mythology and metaphor. It’s a gripping, painful experience through arduous mental anguish and trauma. It outpaces its existence as a fantasy game and becomes relatable to real life real fast. And you should be prepared for that going into it. </p><p>At least the girl has some friends. As the story progresses, <em>Hellblade II</em> introduces three other characters who’ll accompany Senua. They won’t fight alongside you, and are often absent during the majority of Senua’s trips through altered states of reality, but they have a direct and vested interest in the struggles of those living in fear of the giants. </p><p>These NPCs offer a dynamic arguably absent from <em>Saga</em>’s predecessor. Here, Senua must contend not only with the struggles of her mind and the supernatural forces surrounding her, but also with the bonds she must forge with these characters, some of which start off rougher and more complicated than others. </p><figure id="" data-id="830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-recommend-id="image://830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-recommend-id="image://830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s an interesting change from the first game, one that gives this game a richer and more varied range of characters to center while also making the world feel larger. </p><p>Unlike <em>Sacrifice</em>, this isn’t just a story of Senua’s own trauma and inner turmoil; it’s also about those who have lost safety and security as a result of the giants. That said, <em>Saga </em>is clearly dealing with themes of human violence that aren’t just about menacing monsters that go bump in the night. Whether or not the supernatural elements of the game are merely powerful metaphors for human violence and trauma or not, Senua persists through the same reality as everyone around her. She just sees it differently. And with that, she brings hope to the world.</p><p>The presence of additional flesh-and-blood characters positions Senua as a different kind of protagonist than she was in the first game. She’s now a savior for the people she encounters. And her unique perspective on reality, something seen as a gift by others, is valued for what she can do and learn. We get to see who she is in relation to others, and how her experience of reality positions her in this culture. It’s a smart decision for the sequel to make.</p><figure id="" data-id="077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-recommend-id="image://077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-recommend-id="image://077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h69344"><a id=""></a>Wear headphones, kill the lights, turn off your phone, and <em>focus</em></h2><p>When you start up <em>Hellblade II</em>, you will be told the game is best experienced with headphones. And while I imagine that a well-designed, likely  expensive, home theater setup could deliver a compelling experience, headphones will better create the sense that the game lives in your head in a powerful way.</p><p>The only way to experience <em>Hellblade II</em>, in my estimation, is to devote as much of your attention and sensory abilities to it as possible. <em>Saga</em> is a game that lives to exist on a large screen in a dark room, and you should remove all possible distractions. </p><div><h4> You should play <em>Senua’s Saga</em> with a controller on PC  </h4><p> Unless you’re a forever-keyboard gamer, I heartily recommend playing <em>Senua’s Saga</em>  with a gamepad for the sake of rumble alone. The added physical  movement of the controller in your hands very much adds to the intensity  of the experience. As I said, you should devote as much of your senses  as you can to this game, and controller rumble provides a satisfying  physical sensation. It’s worth it.  </p></div><p><em>Saga</em> presents a direct and focused path that Senua and her inner demons traverse as she searches for solutions for the people of Iceland.

Sometimes this does make it hard to tell exactly when you’re in control of the game, which can be disorienting. And in fact, I think the way <em>Saga</em> moves seamlessly from moments of interaction to moments of observation contributes to a bit of narrative exhaustion; your actions in the game are almost always focused on the next story beat with little time to stop for air. And no one’s here to ask you if you want to try your hand at some fishing, or gather 30 units of sheeps’ wool to make a new garment for Senua.</p><p>The end result is a seamless, distraction-free narrative journey that pulls you in and wows your senses with its audio and visual flair. And while there are definitely impressive technological feats on display here, they all serve to create an experience that bucks so many current trends that often define what we think makes a game “game-like.” And I mean that in a good way.</p><h2 id="h69345"><a id=""></a>A breath of focused fresh air amongst modern games</h2><figure id="" data-id="da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-recommend-id="image://da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-recommend-id="image://da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As I’ve said, <em>Saga</em> has virtually no HUD.

Succeeding in combat grants the feeling of growing with Senua as a warrior, while suffering from poorly timed attacks sees her battered about in a way that feels thematically congruent with the game’s themes of struggle and strife. Every attack you land as Senua, or suffer from an enemy who got the better of you, seamlessly feels like part of the narrative experience. </p><div><h4> A few notes on graphics settings for PC  </h4><div> <p><em>Saga</em> is a gorgeous game with beautiful  character models and mesmerizing landscapes. It’s also a very narrative,  dare I say “cinematic,” experience, so if you can only run it at 30  frames-per-second, you’re still likely to have an enjoyable time. There  are a few musts, I found: Definitely switch the game’s upscaler to DLSS  if you have an Nvidia card, or FSR3 if you have AMD GPU. </p><p>&nbsp;Additionally, I  struggled a bit with some visual artifacting early on that seemed to go  away when I bumped the “Effects Quality” setting to “High.” By hitting  the space bar in the graphics settings, you’ll get a preview of how Senua  and the world look based on your settings. You can also rely on the performance  meter in the “Graphics” options to get a sense of how to fine  tune your experience on PC.  </p></div></div><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is also very short, and I do wonder if it could’ve spent its time a little better. Fight sequences get a little repetitive with constant, rotating one-on-one showdowns. And some of the puzzles, particularly an early one after Senua learns a bit more about the plight of Iceland, overstay their welcome. It’s very easy to get lost. But just when I began to feel a little tired of skulking around in the darkness, the game would take a narrative turn that hit me square in the heart, thanks in no small part to actor Melina Juergens’ emotionally powerful performance as Senua.</p><figure id="" data-id="cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-recommend-id="image://cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-recommend-id="image://cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lasting just eight or nine hours, you can maybe work your way through the game in a weekend. In a world of games that want to have your attention forever, that is one of the great gifts of <em>Saga</em>. There’s an almost counter-cultural vibe going on with this game, one where you think less of how to “game” it, and instead are simply focused on the gripping narrative, which itself is aiming to subvert a few expectations of what a warrior is and what they should do to earn such a title. The game sustains that up until its conclusion, which I’m still thinking about as I come to understand what this journey has been for Senua…and perhaps for myself.</p><hr><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is a special game of complicated emotions. In fact, on one occasion when I attempted to play it on Steam Deck (where the experience was less than ideal but but certainly playable), I had to stop as I was in public and began to get overly emotional during a specific part that meditates heavily on identity and suffering. </p><figure id="" data-id="2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-recommend-id="image://2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-recommend-id="image://2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Saga</em> is focused on unearthing the nature of monsterhood in a way that you might not be prepared for, especially if you’ve had struggles with mental health or have deep personal traumas of your own. And, I might add, this is especially the case if you identify as a woman. You should, and perhaps must, take the time to care for your own emotions during <em>Saga</em>’s eight-hour duration, one which I think ultimately will lead you to perhaps consider ways in which both individuals and humanity might escape from perpetual, spiraling patterns of destruction.</p><p>Senua’s enduring compassion and dedication through a rage-inducing journey of pain left a significant impression on me.

            <p>Nintendo will acquire US game developer Shiver Entertainment from Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Shiver is best known for its port work, and most recently handled the Switch ports of Warner Bros’ Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>Nintendo says it has acquired the firm to ‘secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles’. It adds that post-acquisition, Shiver will continue to port and develop software ‘for multiple platforms, including Nintendo Switch’.</p>
<p>Nintendo doesn't make too many acquisitions, certainly compared to its rivals. However, it has made some strategic moves in recent years. In 2022, it acquired <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-long-running-partner-studio-srd-co">long-term development partner SRD studio,</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-completes-dynamo-pictures-acquisition-relaunches-as-nintendo-pictures">Japanese animation firm Dynamo Pictures</a> (later renamed Nintendo Pictures). It also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-next-level-games">acquired Luigi's Mansion developer Next Level Games in 2021.</a></p>
<p>The company has been investing heavily in expanding its development capacity due to the longer development cycles required to make modern video games. This includes a new development centre, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/opening-of-nintendos-new-development-centre-delayed">which is set to be completed by 2028.</a></p>
<p>In the firm’s latest financial call, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa discussed the company’s approach to the expansion, and said that although acquisitions may form part of the strategy, the firm’s focus is on building up its internal resources and maintaining its relationships with existing third-party dev partners.</p>
<p>“We have continuously expanded our development resources over the past several years through the recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires,” he said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to actively work to secure the necessary development resources to increase the long-term value of our IP and to constantly offer unique entertainment proposals. Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development. In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners.</p>
<p>“The process of game development will inevitably become longer, more complex, and more advanced. It is vital that Nintendo offers consumers new and unique experiences through game development, so we will actively invest in expanding our development resources”</p>

<p id="7e50o5">Neither of these bizarre Pokémon are used in PvP or PvE content, but it doesn’t mean you should ignore its shiny form, which... mainly changes the color of its eyes and little hand buttons.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Elgyem in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Elgyem is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

Shiver was founded in 2012 and since then, Nintendo notes, "has partnered with publishers and developers through commissions for large scale title developments." It was acquired <a href="https://saber.games/embracer-group-acquires-shiver-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by Embracer Group in 2021</a>. </p><p>"By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles," the announcement reads.

Some of its ports, like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-nintendo-switch-performance-review">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/25/mortal-kombat-11-switch-review">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, have gone over well enough, although its Mortal Kombat 1 port was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-for-switch-review">widely criticized</a>.</p><p>Financial terms were not disclosed in the announcement, but Nintendo noted that the acquisition "will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>AI is all the rage these days, and it seems that Microsoft is adding its take on the technology to some of its Xbox and PC games. At the company's recent Surface and AI event, it showed off its new Copilot AI, which is Microsoft's unique twist on what we've seen from big tech firms like OpenAI (ChatGPT) and Google (Gemini).</p><p dir="ltr">Over on X/Twitter, Microsoft posted a demo video of a player using Copilot to learn how to craft a sword in Minecraft. According to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fmicrosofts-ai-will-be-inside-minecraft-and-other-xbox-pc-games-new-copilot-features-will-search-your-inventories-offer-tips-and-guides&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmicrosoft-is-putting-its-copilot-ai-into-games-like-minecraft%2F1100-6523588%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Windows Central</a>, this AI will respond to natural language (like most LLMs) and will explain how to use the resources you have, and will even guide you to them. Microsoft emphasized that the data used for Copilot will remain on-device, and that it won't be uploaded to the cloud or used to train language models further without the user's consent.</p><p dir="ltr">As with all AI models, it sounds good in theory, but it remains to be seen if it actually works. So-called AI "<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fmitsloanedtech.mit.edu%2Fai%2Fbasics%2Faddressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmicrosoft-is-putting-its-copilot-ai-into-games-like-minecraft%2F1100-6523588%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">hallucinations</a>" (i.e. the model making up or reporting inaccurate info) have been a problem with LLMs from the very beginning, which could lead to some frustrating scenarios. But all-in-all, this is a potential game-changer for those who would prefer to avoid digging through game wikis and Google searches to find the answer to that tough puzzle.</p><p dir="ltr">At this event, Microsoft showed off what it calls "Copilot+ PCs," which come loaded with proprietary AI technology. However, they will require better hardware to fully leverage that tech, including a neural processor and 16GB of RAM. Windows laptops with AI will start rolling out on June 18.</p>

<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced that it is buying</a> Shiver Entertainment, the studio that ported games like Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 to the console. Nintendo is buying 100% of the outstanding shares from Embracer Group.</p>



<p>The Miami-based Shiver will now become a wholly-owned subsidy of Nintendo.</p>



<p>“By welcoming Shiver’s experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles,” Nintendo said in a press release. </p>



<p>“Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver’s focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch.”</p>



<p>The purchase of Shiver is the first studio acquisition by Nintendo since it bought Luigi’s Mansion 3 developer Next Level Games in 2021. </p>



<p>“The Acquisition will be completed pending satisfaction of all relevant customary closing conditions,” Nintendo says. It added that the purchase will have “only a minor effect” on the company’s financial outlook for the year.</p>

            <p>
Last June, Dead Cells developers Motion Twin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-is-getting-a-ten-episode-animated-series-next-year">revealed</a> its acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer was being turned into a 10-episode animated series, and a first proper trailer has now been shared ahead of its arrival this June.
</p>
<p>
Dead Cells' TV series is the work of Paris-based animation studio Bobbypills - the team behind Dead Cells' animated trailers, as well as last year's excellent Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon spinoff, Captain Laserhawk - and whisks viewers away to a cursed island ravaged by a strange plague.
</p>
<p>
"After the island's foolish king develops a remedy that ends up turning the population into monstrous creatures," the official announcement revealed last year, "prophecies depicting a flame-headed hero begin to appear. As it so happens this beheaded hero is real, but saving a kingdom isn't on his schedule and he just wants to be left alone."
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Dead Cells : Immortalis | Trailer (VF / ENGLISH SUB)" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wgCy3FINeGU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>

<p>
As to what that looks like in practice (the answer appears to be 'crudely but enthusiastically animated'), you can see above. And if you don't speak French, there are English subtitles too.
</p>
<p>
Dead Cells: Immortalis (as it's titled in France) has been produced in conjunction with French anime streaming service ADN, and its 10 seven-minute-long episodes will air there on 19th June. An English version and worldwide release is due later this year.
</p>
<p>
Dead Cells has been a huge success (it's now sold over 10m copies since releasing back in 2017), but there was drama earlier this year when Evil Empire - the studio responsible for its years of impressive post-launch support - revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">no longer be working on the game</a>. The news original developer Motion Twin was pulling the plug on Dead Cells' post-launch support took many by surprise given Evil Empire (which is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">working on The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> for Ubisoft) previously said it had a roadmap of new content until "at least the end of 2024".
</p>
<p>
Former Dead Cells lead designer Sébastien Benard later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-designer-calls-decision-to-end-development-the-worst-imaginable-asshole-move">called</a> Motion Twin's decision "the worst imaginable asshole move", saying, "I wish the absolute best to [Evil Empire] for their next things, and hope people working there will survive this sudden economic cut."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-release-date-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox's Sims-like life-sim <em>Life By You </em>has been delayed again, and thus the <em>Life By You</em> release date will not be June 4th. That was the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/early-access-release-of-sims-like-game-life-by-you-delayed-again-by-paradox" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Early Access Release of The Sims-Like Game Life by You Delayed Again by Paradox">release date announced </a>back in March.</p>

<p>This is actually the third<em> </em>time for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/early-access-of-sims-like-game-life-by-you-delayed" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Early Access of Sims-Like Game Life by You Delayed by Several Months"><em>Life by You </em>delay</a>, as it was also delayed in July 2023, from a planned September release date. It may be that following the very rough launch of <em>Cities Skylines 2</em>, the publisher is being cautious with a new game releasing, and making sure that its early access state is good enough to stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What is the <em>Life By You</em> Release Date?</h2>

<p>There is no new release window or date for <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-life-by-you-release-date.1680458/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" An Update on &quot;Life By You&quot; release date"><em>Life By You</em> in the Paradox announcement</a>. Instead, they state they want to avoid committing to a date that they might be unable to meet, requiring a fourth delay potentially.</p>

<p>The full <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/life-by-you" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Life By You"><em>Life By You</em></a> delay statement is:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>
After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th. This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.</p><p>
While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.</p><p>
We will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.</p><p>
Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2redemption-update-mods" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Cities: Skylines 2 Starts on Road to Redemption With Big Update and Mods"><em>Cities Skylines 2 </em>issues </a>that have plagued its launch, its possible that Paradox might be concerned about the increasing number of games targetting the Life sim subgenre, with games like <em>Paralives </em>and <em>Afterlife</em> in the works. With more Sims-like games in the works, having a higher caliber product at the early access launch may help it start strong and sustain in a market place that will have more competition then they may have expected when they signed the game.</p>

<p>Just a couple of years ago, companies like Nvidia were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/500-hz-asus-monitor-promises-fewer-visual-artifacts-less-latency-than-ever/">talking up prototype 500 Hz gaming monitors</a> as having "benefits [for] every game and gamer, not just competitive games and esports pros." Now, the high frame rate experts at Blur Busters <a href="https://blurbusters.com/displayweek-2024-news-4k-1000hz-monitor-exhibited-and-new-blur-busters-display-tester/">bring word</a> of a 4K, 1,000 Hz prototype screen being shown off by <a href="https://en.tclcsot.com/">Chinese panel maker TCL CSOT</a> at <a href="https://www.displayweek.org/">the manufacturer-focused DisplayWeek 2024 conference</a>.</p>
<p>TCL's proof-of-concept panel is all the more impressive for not sacrificing resolution in the name of its high frame rate—many current 480 Hz monitors tend to top out at 1080p resolutions or offer "dual mode" options for higher resolutions at lower maximum refresh rates. And while <a href="https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=8388#p64988">recent advancements in pixel-flipping times</a> have enabled TCL's LCD prototype, Blur Busters estimates that 1,000 Hz OLED displays could be commercialized as soon as 2027.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>— Blur Busters (@BlurBusters) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlurBusters/status/1790773962563273119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The apparent, impending breaking of the four-digit refresh rate threshold got us thinking: Are we finally approaching a point of diminishing returns in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/480-hz-desktop-laptop-displays-teased-by-pc-panel-pusher-auo/">monitor-makers' long-running battle of the Hz</a>? Or is 1,000 Hz just the latest stepping stone to realms of motion smoothness yet unimagined by most gamers?</p>
<h2>60 fps is just the start</h2>
<p>Research suggests that most humans <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298007">stop detecting flickering in lights pulsing at around 60 Hz</a>, a finding that has led many to erroneously claim that the human eye "can't see beyond 60 fps." The misunderstanding stems in part from the fact that this "flicker threshold" generally measures how a human reacts to flickering in a single light source. The eye's reaction to the illusion of motion in a display made up of millions of individual pixels can be quite different.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>A simple <a href="https://www.testufo.com/">motion test</a> on a high-end monitor is enough to clearly demonstrate the advantages of refresh rates beyond 60 Hz. Fast-moving on-screen objects look decidedly less blurry as you climb higher and higher on the refresh rate curve, because the pixels from the object's previous position "persist" for less time at higher rates. This low persistence can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/oculus-creates-a-new-open-source-unit-of-time-to-measure-frame-rates/">especially important in virtual reality displays</a>, where motion blurring and lower refresh rates can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/major-game-publishers-express-concern-about-vrs-motion-sickness-problem/">lead</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/valve-blames-developers-for-lingering-vr-nasuea-issues/">motion sickness</a> as you tilt your head quickly around a virtual environment.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Fast-moving objects appear decidedly less blurry as you climb the frame rate curve.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once displays get to about 1,000 Hz, that's when Blur Busters says you start to see results where <a href="https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=9552">"things stop motion blurring."</a> But even faster refresh rates could help with the apparent sharpness of extremely fast objects on Ultra HD displays—think of a mouse pointer or video game crosshair that can move across the roughly 4,000 horizontal pixels on a 4K display in a single second. To eliminate the <a href="https://blurbusters.com/the-stroboscopic-effect-of-finite-framerate-displays/">stroboscopic effects</a> that can happen on objects moving that quickly, you might need a theoretical display of 10,000 Hz or more.</p>
<p>Of course, even with a 1,000 Hz monitor, you'll need content running at 1,000 frames per second to take full advantage of the ultra-fast pixel-flipping hardware. While that level of performance might sound ludicrous for current hardware running any modern games, that kind of performance is no longer as unattainable as you might think. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/frames-win-games/">Nvidia data</a> shows the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">RTX 4090</a> generating 600+ fps frame rates on aging-but-still-popular games like <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> at "High" settings and a full 1440p resolution.</p>
<p>Factor in a few more generations of graphics card upgrades—not to mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/dlss-fsr-microsoft-aims-to-end-the-pc-gaming-upscaling-wars-with-directsr/">frame-generation technology</a> that <a href="https://blurbusters.com/frame-generation-essentials-interpolation-extrapolation-and-reprojection/">could offer 10 reprojected frames for every key frame</a>—and waiting a single millisecond for your monitor to show a new image might not be totally ridiculous. With the way things are going, we're already awaiting the day, years from now, when we look back on an article like this and find it quaint that we were ever impressed by the idea of a display that topped out at a mere 1,000 Hz.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has reportedly already greenlit Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 developer Ninja Theory's next project and has "no plans whatsoever" to close the studio - news that comes amid fan concerns for its future following the closure of Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.
</p>
<p>
The relative lack of promotion for Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 in the run up to tomorrow's launch had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-2-is-only-two-weeks-away-and-fans-feel-xbox-should-be-making-more-noise">some Ninja Theory fans worried</a> the game might ultimately slip under the radar, leading the studio to suffer the same fate as its Xbox bedfellows. Xbox's Aaron Greenberg previously attempted to allay fan fears by promising an imminent Hellblade 2 "global paid media campaign", and a new report from Windows Central also suggests concern is unwarranted.
</p>
<p>
According <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch">to the publication</a>, which says its information comes from "trusted sources", Ninja Theory now has two projects in the works away from Hellblade 2. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-announces-project-mara">previously unveiled Project Mara</a> - described by the studio as a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror" - plus an unannounced game that's already been greenlit by Microsoft.

<p>
Windows Central doesn't offer any clues as to what this latter project might be, but it insists Microsoft has "no plans whatsoever to close the studio any time soon." This comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Xbox's 1900 layoffs in January</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">recent closures</a> of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games. Microsoft also recently merged Roundhouse Studios with The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios.
</p>
<p>

In a "thank you" message to fans <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264">shared</a> ahead of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 release tomorrow, Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews wrote, "From the very beginning of Senua's Sage: Hellbade 2, we have had you in-mind and I truly hope that when you play the second chapter of Senua's story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and that also so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too."
</p>
<p>
"Making video games is difficult," Matthews continued. "Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest: to make a game that sinks you deep into Senua's world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling. I believe we have achieved our quest and I hope you'll agree. I'm very proud of the game, very proud of our team, and very prod of you, our fans, who have supported us on this magical journey."
</p>
<p>
Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 arrives seven years after its acclaimed predeccessor. Last month, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5">Polygon reported</a> Ninja Theory veteran Tameem Antoniades, the game's director and writer, had departed the Cambridge-based studio, although it remains unclear why.

The original game launched back in 1983 and since then has seen multiple revisions, the last being the 4th edition in 2008. As mentioned, the 4th edition has been out of print for a while, and the game is expensive to grab from resellers. This new 5th edition printing will make picking up a copy of the game much easier--but considering it's an Avalon Hill game of a classic that many newer board game enthusiasts haven't had a chance to try, we wouldn't be surprised if the first wave of preorders sold out.</p><p dir="ltr">While you wait for your order to arrive, you could check out the officially licensed video game adaptation of Talisman.

                <p>The tactical sci-fi franchise, BattleTech, is turning 40 this year, and it's celebrating by launching a new edition of the original board game. Since its debut in 1984, the BattleTech franchise has branched out to video games, novels, TV, and more, but the series started as a tabletop board game dubbed BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat. As such, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3M6JBY1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BattleTech's 40th Anniversary Edition</a> will be worth checking out whether you're a longtime fan who wants to commemorate the occasion or a newcomer interested in trying the classic game for the first time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-player-creates-their-own-mandalorian-experience-with-over-100-mods/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=starfield-player-creates-their-own-mandalorian-experience-with-over-100-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="213" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Still mad at the cancellation of the rumored <em>Mandalorian</em> shooter? Then consider using all of your anger to follow the path of DeityVengy, a <em>Starfield </em>modder who more or less created his own <em>Mandalorian </em>experience.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">There are people who already love <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a></em> as is, and others who can at least see all the possibilities to make a great game that exist within. Some of those from the latter group are more dedicated than others, and hardly anyone will beat DeityVengy, a YouTuber and <em>Starfield</em> modding enthusiast who employed over one hundred mods to turn <em>Starfield</em> into the closest we can get to a video game adaptation of the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">On top of character skins, blasters, mobile empire units, Jetpacks, and revamped <em>Star Wars-</em>based menus, the most amazing part is that everything works beautifully well together. It really does look like you’re in one of the highest-budget episodes of the series.</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="I Turned Starfield Into the Ultimate Star Wars Game... 100+ Mods | Improvements | Raytracing" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydaWXoidoo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">Even though DeityVengy is constantly trying to improve the experience and will probably never stop adding new mods as he finds them, they say the mods below constitute the core of this <em>Mandalorian</em> experience.</p> <ul data-found-items="13" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandalorian Suit</a></li> <li data-index="1"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Aliens</a></li> <li data-index="2"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UC Empire</a></li> <li data-index="3"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7410">Freestar Rebels</a></li> <li data-index="4"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Collective – Crimson Fleet Conversion</a></li> <li data-index="5"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Purge Troopers</a></li> <li data-index="6"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugin’s Ecliptic Bounty Hunters</a></li> <li data-index="7"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)</a></li> <li data-index="8"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Aurebesh Conversion</a></li> <li data-index="9"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield HD Overhaul</a></li> <li data-index="10"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boostpack to Jetpack</a></li> <li data-index="11"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unified Camera</a></li> <li data-index="12"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slightly Better Weapon Icons</a></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">Whether you love or don’t care for Bethesda’s games, it’s hard to deny that they still push the envelope when it comes to fan creations — even when the company seems to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-on-pc-has-broken-mods-while-also-barely-fixing-anything/">accidentally thwart all modding efforts in other games. </a></p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">If none of this floats your spaceship, you can play normal <em>Starfield </em>on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and watch <em>The Mandalorian</em> on Disney +.</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When you finally <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-kuva-sobek-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get your Kuva Sobek</a> in <em>Warframe</em>, you will want to use the best mods for the best build. Don’t worry, we got you covered. If you want to go all out with this amazing shotgun, check out what we have cooking below.</p> <h2 id="h-best-kuva-sobek-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Best Kuva Sobek build in <em>Warframe</em></h2> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">This is going to be a very end-game-friendly build that’s great for general use. It has a stronger emphasis on mobbing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-acid-shells-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the Acid Shells mod.</a> So, here’s the setup:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Hell</li> <li>Galvanized Savvy</li> <li>Primed Ravage</li> <li>Toxic Barrage</li> <li>Frigid Blast</li> <li>Acid Shells</li> <li>Critical Deceleration</li> <li>Hunter Munitions</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="26" data-injectable="false"><strong>Exilus: </strong>Vigilante Supplies</p> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="90" data-injectable="false"><strong>Arcane:</strong> Primary Merciless, Primary Deadhead, or Shotgun Vendetta</p> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false"><strong>Progenitor Element: </strong>Fire</p> <figure data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">With this build, you’re going to be doing <strong>heavy critical hits with heat and viral damage often. </strong>It’s great against armor and health. Also, once you start getting kills with this, nearby enemies will be inflicted with Corrosive, giving you bonus damage with the Galvanized Savvy mod.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Pair all that with Hunter Munitions and now you have something that chews through health and armor with ease. Bonus points if you use Warframes that have <strong>grouping abilities like Nidus with his Larva</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">It’s important that your Progenitor element is fire so that you get to just put in the Viral elemental combination in any order. Just as long as you have cold and toxin together, you can get that combination.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Also, there’s wiggle room with the Arcane Enhancements since this weapon is quite versatile. The projectile spread on this gun is very tight, making it a prime candidate for headshots. However, if you aren’t too good at hitting enemy heads, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-shotgun-vendetta-arcane-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just opt for the Shotgun Vendetta</a> or Primary Merciless options.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">To get the <strong>Fire element</strong> on the shotgun, these are the frames that give the element upon starting the Lich process:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="false"> <li>Chroma</li> <li>Ember</li> <li>Inaros</li> <li>Kullervo</li> <li>Nezha</li> <li>Protea</li> <li>Vauban</li> <li>Wisp</li> </ul>

This shift, understandably, didn’t go over well with players as the cost to stay up-to-date with modern gaming continues to rise, but that might not stop Take-Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar Games) from trying to push it further with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a></span>—one of the few upcoming games that could probably sell for $80.<br></p><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,191709,196424" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In 2022, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/70-dollar-games-60-ubisoft-ea-gotham-knights-ps5-xbox-1849593604">the era of $70 video games began</a></span>.

I mean, one of the biggest games in 2024 is<em> Helldivers 2</em> and it sports a $40 price tag. In just the last few months, <em>Manor Lords, Gray Zone Warfare, </em>and <em>Content Warning</em> have found big success on Steam and they all cost far less than $70.<br></p><p>But <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is different.

And folks, I’m not holding my breath, especially as games cost more and more to make and take longer and longer to create. I think if Zelnick and Take-Two believe <em>GTA 6</em> can succeed at $80 they’ll charge that and sell you a special edition for even more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Wingspan has quickly ascended in recent years to become one of the most popular board games. Not only has the delightful card-based engine builder made a home in the collections of more serious hobbyists, but Wingspan has also been found nesting in the board game aisles of major retailers like Target and Walmart. Wingspan isn’t just a financial success either; it’s also a critical darling. The base package is the recipient of numerous Game of the Year awards and is widely considered one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games</u></a> on the market. </p><p>For those who have yet to play a round of Wingspan, it might seem odd that a board game essentially centered around the somewhat niche hobby of birdwatching has captivated millions of players. Simply upon opening the box, however, it’s apparent how much love and attention has been paid to its construction. The passion of first-time game designer Elizabeth Hargrave is soaked into every component, from the hand-painted cards to the moss-covered dice tray designed to look like a bird feeder. Not to mention, but most importantly, the act of playing is simply fun. It’s perhaps cliché to refer to a board game as an accessible title that is difficult to master, but Wingspan perfectly embodies the sentiment with its mostly straightforward ruleset and wealth of advanced strategies.</p><p>Soaring sales numbers and a laundry list of accolades have led to several expansions and various iterations, adding more and more tabletop enthusiasts to the list of budding ornithologists. Wingspan’s expansions build upon existing strategies by adding even more birds from around the world with new mechanisms and abilities, but before exploring new habitats, players should first set their sights on the base game.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Wingspan</h3><div id="155272"><p><h3>Wingspan</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65.00</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 1-5</li><li>Play Time: 40-70 mins</li></ul><p>The Wingspan base game was released in 2019, and it remains a fantastic experience for solo playthroughs as well as get-togethers with friends and family. As noted in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><u>Wingspan review</u></a>, the box is stuffed with unique components such as hand-painted cards, a bird feeder-style dice tray, and pastel-colored eggs, as well as themed tokens, dice, and player boards. Everything needed for hours of single and multiplayer fun is included in this beautifully constructed package. The base game is also required for several of the expansions, making this an ideal starting point. Many of the birds included in this iteration of Wingspan are based on Hargrave’s real-life observations in Maryland, but the various expansions add species from around the globe.</p><h2>The Expansions</h2><h3>Wingspan: European Expansion</h3><div id="200848"><p><h3>Wingspan European Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $30.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>90 cards (81 new bird cards, 5 bonus cards, 4 Automa cards)</li><li>New colorful scorecard for single and multiplayer scoring</li><li>15 purple egg miniatures</li><li>38 added food tokens</li><li>Custom storage tray</li><li>5 goal tiles and 1 reference tile</li><li>Rulebook</li></ul><p>As you might have already guessed, the European Expansion adds birds from the continent of Europe to the Wingspan series. The 81 new bird cards are designed to shuffle directly into the original deck present in the Wingspan base game. The appeal isn’t simply just adding beautiful new cards to the deck, however. The birds within the European Expansion introduce new abilities to the game, many of which are designed to increase player interaction. To house and accommodate the stunning new components, the expansion also includes a new custom tray, extra food tokens, additional egg miniatures, and a colorful new scorecard.</p><p>While the European Expansion is the first add-on to be released, it isn’t necessarily recommended as the next package to pick up after Wingspan. It is certainly a worthwhile addition, but it doesn’t add as much new content or mechanics to the experience as more recent expansions. Completionists and those simply looking to add more bird cards to their decks certainly won’t be disappointed by the European Expansion, but due to the sheer amount of new game-changing content in subsequent releases, it might be wise to revisit this update after incorporating either the Oceania Expansion or Wingspan Asia… or both.</p><h3>Wingspan: Oceania Expansion</h3><div id="200849"><p><h3>Wingspan Oceania Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>107 cards (95 new bird cards, 5 bonus cards, 7 Automa cards)</li><li>69 nectar tokens (a new food type introduced in the expansion)</li><li>15 yellow egg miniatures</li><li>5 new player mats and 5 new dice</li><li>4 goal tiles and 1 reference tile</li><li>Rulebooks and scorepad</li></ul><p>The Oceania Expansion, Wingspan’s second add-on, primarily introduces new birds from Australia and New Zealand. Like the European Expansion, the Oceania cards are designed to shuffle right into the deck of the base game. Unlike the European Expansion, however, Oceania introduces a new food source and board to Wingspan that significantly changes the gameplay. Nectar, the aforementioned new food source, is unique as it serves as a sort of wild card that can be played in place of other food types. Another added twist is that unused nectar tokens are returned to the supply at the end of each round.</p><p>The Oceania Expansion also includes a new game board that not only incorporates nectar but also alters bonuses and requirements for playing cards in certain areas, resulting in even more eventful turns and a change to traditional strategy. These components, along with the new dice, essentially replace the original pieces in the base game when abiding by the expansion’s rules. Largely due to these gameplay updates, it is recommended to pick up the Oceania Expansion before the European Expansion as the cards in the latter will fold right into the deck and updated mechanics. That being said, there is still one additional expansion to check out.</p><h3>Wingspan Asia</h3><div id="200850"><p><h3>Wingspan Asia</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $45.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 1-2 standalone or 6-7 when combined with base game</li><li>Play Time: 40-70 mins</li></ul><p>Components (DOES NOT REQUIRE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>122 cards (90 new bird cards, 14 bonus cards, 18 Automa cards)</li><li>A Deut game board for 2-player mode</li><li>A turn-order dial for Flock mode which allows for 6-7 players</li><li>2 double-sided player mats for standard and Oceania rules</li><li>81 food tokens, 5 dice, and a birdfeeder board</li><li>An appendix, scorecard, and rulebooks for multiplayer and Automa play</li><li>Components for Duet and Flock modes such as tokens, goal tiles, swift-start guides</li></ul><p>Wingspan Asia sets itself apart from the Oceania and European Expansions by serving as both an expansion and a standalone experience. The two-player Duet mode does not require the base game. It also plays a little bit differently than two-player Wingspan, adding a new map with bonus objectives to track throughout the game. Of course, like the other expansions, this Duet mode along with the additional bird cards can be tacked onto the base game, shuffling right into the core entry. As Duet mode adds a bit of unique strategy without further complicating the rules, it's a welcome wrinkle for two-player games for those who are already enjoying Wingspan.</p><p>Flock mode, on the other hand, can get a bit messy and does require the base game. Without diving too deep into the rulebook, Flock mode basically makes it so two games of Wingspan are occurring at once. Honestly, it’s not the ideal way to experience the series, but that doesn’t mean Winspan Asia isn’t worth buying.</p><p>The Duet mode and new cards introduced in Wingspan Asia are well worth the investment by themselves. Not to mention, for those looking to solely experience Wingspan as a one or two-person game, there is an argument that this is an ideal starting point. That said, most will still likely want to start with the base game as it has the ability to play up to five. If you can manage to wrangle in more players, Wingspan is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players"><u>best four-player board games</u></a>, and it also plays exceptionally well at three players. As an expansion, the decision between Oceania and Asia depends on what you’re looking for and how much you’re willing to spend. Players who want the ultimate two-player experience and a standalone version may want to check out Wingspan Asia first, while other players looking to enhance the original game will likely want to plot a course directly toward the Oceania Expansion.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Wyrmspan</h3><div id="199023"><p><h3>Wyrmspan</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-5</li><li>Play Time: 90 mins</li></ul><p>If birds still aren’t your thing, Wyrmspan offers many of the same mechanics as Wingspan, but with dragons instead. Those familiar with Wingspan will quickly catch onto Wyrmspan, but that’s not to say it's simply a fantasy-themed reskin. For example, the introduction of the Dragon Guild card serves as an entirely unique idea that offers players who trigger the mechanic various bonuses. It’s a simple yet rewarding tweak that packs even more fun into turns without adding too many complicated rules to the core gameplay inspired by Wingspan.</p><p>Wyrmspan is a standalone game not at all compatible with Wingspan. That said, many of the components that make the original title great are also present here. Like Wingspan, Wyrmspan features incredible artwork, beautiful components, accessible rules, and deep strategy. Games run slightly longer than its predecessor and the added mechanics ever-so-slightly steepen the learning curve, but those interested in dragons—pretty much everyone, I assume—are encouraged to check out Wyrmspan. Read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">Wyrmspan review</a> for more information.</p><h3>Wingspan: Digital Edition</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dMld6" target="_blank">Get it for PC</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVgv0" target="_blank">Get it for Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/gld30" target="_blank">Get it for Xbox</a></li></ul><p>Digital versions of Wingspan as well as its Oceania and European Expansions are available on PC, Switch, and Xbox. On PC and console, the base game retails for $19.99 USD, while the Oceana and European Expansions go for $11.99 and $9.99 respectively. There are also mobile versions of Wingspan available on iOS and Android for $9.99 USD, with the European Expansion offered as an in-app purchase for an additional $9.99.</p><p>Additionally, Wingspan is available to play on Board Game Arena with a Premium Membership. For those unfamiliar with the site, Board Game Arena is a massive platform for playing board games online. While Board Game Arena does offer many titles for free, games like Wingspan are only accessible at the Premium tier. At just $3.00 per month (billed at $36.00 yearly), it’s a relatively inexpensive way to play hundreds of board games right from your computer. Of course, digital versions miss out on some of the social aspects of board games like Wingspan, but they’re great options for those who want to save a little bit of money and for nights when it’s difficult to get people together.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Wingspan is a fantastic game for any collection. The various expansions each offer something unique, along with a ton of beautifully illustrated bird cards. For those who simply cannot get into the bird-watching theme, Wyrmspan offers a similarly fun time, but with dragons. Luckily, many of these titles can be purchased well under MSRP, especially the base version of Wingspan which can often be found on sale at various retailers like Target, Walmart, and Amazon, as well as your local board game shop.

<p data-characters="386" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">All eyes are on Himawari and Sarada as the world anticipates the reveal of their powers in the eleventh chapter of <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em>. Chapter 10 left fans hungry for more pages, as the monthly manga showcased the two daughters channeling the aesthetics of their fathers. Clear some room on your calendars, here’s when we can expect <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11 to release.</p> <h2 id="0-boruto-two-blue-vortex-chapter-11-release-date-and-time" data-injectable="false"><em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11 release date and time</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> follows a monthly release schedule with a generous amount of content with each chapter. Currently, <em>Boruto: TBV</em> Chapter 11 is scheduled to be released on <strong>Thursday, June 20, 2024 at 11 a.m. ET (8 a.m. PT).</strong>&nbsp;</p> <div id="ub_countdown_3f1e8031-f526-436b-8f77-5381e8b2d438" data-expirymessage="Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter 11 is live." data-enddate="1718895600" data-largestunit="week" data-smallestunit="second" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><p><span>Weeks</span><span></span><span>Days</span><span></span><span>Hours</span><span></span><span>Minutes</span><span></span><span>Seconds</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p></div> <h2 id="1-where-to-read-boruto-two-blue-vortex-chapter-11" data-injectable="false">Where to read <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11</h2> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Boruto: TBV</em> is free to read on the Viz Media website, the Shonen Jump app, and the MangaPlus app. Each source offers simultaneous releases for <em>Boruto: TBV</em> which means that fans from across the globe receive access to the latest chapters at the same time.</p>
 <p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-baac9447-bc02-456f-b65f-28aed477d712">This next section will contain<strong> spoilers from Chapter 10</strong>, so if you aren’t caught up with the <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1021108">latest manga chapter</a>, you might want to come back after you’ve done so.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect in <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11</h2> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">In Chapter 10, Himawari is safely flown away from the pursuing Shinjus by the coordinated efforts of Team 10. Jura wastes no time and chooses to pursue Himawari, leaving Hidari to handle the jonins led by Konohamaru. Unfortunately for us Konohamaru fans, Sarada arrives and captures Hidari’s attention before the Team 7 leader can get in on the action.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true">Without wasting any time, Hidari attempts a sneak attack on Sarada with her father’s signature jutsu: The Chidori. Thanks to her three-tomoe Sharingan, Sarada can see through the move and counter with a Chidori of her own. After remarking that the jutsu is a move used by her and her father, it seems that Sarada is on track to learn more about Hidari and his connection to Sasuke Uchiha in Chapter 11. We have yet to see what the unique powers of her Mangekyou Sharingan are. But three years after its reveal, it’s likely we’ll see it in action against Hidari.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">The most anticipated moment of Chapter 10 was the conversation between Kurama (It’s really him!) and Himawari. It’s finally confirmed that the nine-tailed fox within Himawari is a resurrection of Kurama, whose chakra was passed onto her through Naruto. Unlike the grumpy adult Kurama who took years to warm up to Naruto, the young fox seems more patient and like a mentor to Himawari from the very beginning. He even remarks that Himawari’s affinity with his chakra is greater than Naruto’s.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MangaPlus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">As expected from the daughter of Naruto, Himawari impulsively attacks Jura and gets herself&nbsp;trapped in a divine tree. After seeing her beloved friend being impaled while attempting to save her, a nostalgic figure rises from the destroyed divine tree. Chapter 10 leaves us with a panel of Himawari baring her canine teeth and distinctive fox features; a spitting image of her father. Based on the flowing of her hair, she’s not going to start with a few tails awakened –&nbsp; but all nine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">The events of <em>Boruto: TBV</em> Chapter 11 are shaping up to be the daughters of Naruto and Sasuke showing everybody that the last names aren’t the only things they inherited. With Sarada and Himawari locked in combat with the mysterious Shinjus, we can expect to see the girls carry the series for the next few chapters.&nbsp;</p>

Greeting the poor employee in the morning right when the store opened, Steinfeld turned over a bunch of cards, including a Miriam trainer and a full art Squirtle from the base <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> set, to see how they were appraised and what he could get for them.</p><p>“These are cool,” the employee, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhRdiBeDxc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhRdiBeDxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who Steinfeld recorded</a></span>, says while thumbing through the PSA graded cards in their acrylic cases. “So how does this whole grading thing work?” (The GameStop employee later told <em>Kotaku</em> he didn’t feel ambushed and was happy to learn on the spot but also didn’t know Steinfeld was filming him.)</p><p>GameStop announced the trade-in program earlier this month and began rolling it out immediately without taking the time to do much training. While scanning codes on the graded cases pulls up what the card should look like and the amounts the store can offer, it’s up to employees to go through an eleven-point checklist to make sure the cards aren’t fraudulent.</p><p>The GameStop employee in the video understandably ends up having to call a supervisor to walk him through the training in real time while also dealing with other customers that come into the store to buy actual games. He looks at the cards, holds them up to the light, and tries to check for any signs of tampering, but like it would be for you or I or anyone else that’s not trained in detecting fake, phony, or counterfeit PSA-graded collectibles, the process looks purely vibes-based.</p><p>Steinfeld estimated the value of the cards he was trading in ahead of time based on recent eBay listings, and the actual amounts GameStop paid him for them were all over the place, from pretty good to pretty terrible. Overall, he got $157 for cards worth an estimated $328, pretty close to 50 percent of the estimated value.</p><p>That might not sound like much considering how easy it is to sell a handful of cards online, but consider this: it’s way more than you’d get for trading in your actual games. GameStop will currently only give you $20 cash for <em>Stellar Blade</em>, which is $70 new on PlayStation 5 and came out less than a month ago. Then again, games are commodities, and PSA-graded cards are, by definition, collectibles. It’s hard to imagine who is selling their rare Lugia to GameStop rather than to another collector on Facebook or eBay.</p><p>Then again, Steinfeld seemingly made out better than some of his own fans did when buying his own Pokémon mystery boxes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/pgbkkz/psa_dont_buy_leonharts_box_its_trash_it_came_with/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/pgbkkz/psa_dont_buy_leonharts_box_its_trash_it_came_with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some buyers of his giveaways</a></span> reported getting less than a third of the value of what they paid for them. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="425" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The backdrop of the <em>Mad Max</em> series is probably more beautiful than a noxious wasteland has any right to be, but it’s still less interesting than the characters populating it. Even though they don’t tend to speak much, the ensemble driving both the vehicles and the plot of the series is responsible for some of the best worldbuilding in the history of cinema. Let’s honor the maddest of the bunch, shall we?</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nu-Max (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="721" data-current-count="1021" data-injectable="true">Even though the series’ very title alludes to his supposed madness, the original Max Rockatansky was never really that mad — especially for a guy who witnessed his family getting run over right before the Apocalypse took place. The new Max, the one that we see in <em>Fury Road,</em> however, seems to have finally completed his transformation into someone who deserves that title. Max states in the trailer that has been reduced to his survival instinct, and it shows. Max barely even talks, and is constantly haunted by people he’s supposedly failed, but the people we see haunting him are not his family. Is this guy even the Max from the original films? There’s no way of knowing, and that’s awesome.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Mad Max 2 - Feral Kid - Boomerang" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAHOMuiipsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Feral Kid (The Road Warrior)</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Though he looks harmless, the Feral Kid is as lethal as a post-apocalyptic reimagining of Kevin McCallister. If nothing else, the kid taught many adults not to knock on Australia’s most famous weapon as he can maim or even kill you with a throw of his boomerang.</p>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">The Feral Kid is such an enigma that many fans believed that the Max that we see in <em>Fury Road</em> is actually a grown-up version of this boomerang master. Fun theory, though it’s one that director George Miller <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/fury-road-director-responds-to-the-mad-max-conspiracy-theory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately shot down.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mad Max - Bubba &amp; Toecutter Wasted [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QU1BnGKoXh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Toecutter (Mad Max)</h2> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">The leader of the biking gang in the original <em>Mad Max</em> isn’t even its nastiest member — you don’t see him cutting off one single toe throughout the entire film, but he has one of the most iconic death scenes in the history of cinema. You can assume this guy is going to get what’s coming to him in a horrifying car crash, but you never expect him to look straight into the camera and have his eyes nearly pop out of their sockets for a final shocked look before his demise.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="You will know the vengeance of Lord Humungus!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6x2C4LMBGI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Lord Humungus (The Road Warrior)</h2> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">Toecutter is imposing because he leads a group of mad men, but Lord Humungus would be imposing on his own — though he too leads an army of even-madder men.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">This is a massive jacked-up beast with a flair for the theatrical who can — and will — crush his enemies with ease. He seems to be impervious to cold, or simply does not believe in the effect clothing has against it as he’s never seen wearing more than his muscles and a mask.</p> <figure data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mad Max: Fury Road - Let There Be Water" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d605rM0U3x0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Immortan Joe (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">George Miller knew he’d found the perfect actor to play a villain in the <em>Mad Max</em> world in Hugh Keays-Byrne, the man who played Toecutter in the original film, so he just brought him back to play a new villain in <em>Fury Road.</em> Immortan Joe is older, but makes great use of his ghostly transparent armor and teeth-filled mask to look as imposing as you can.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">His greatest moment is when he tells his people not to get addicted to water, the perfect quote to leave the audience wondering if they’re witnessing a cruel mind at work, or a yet another completely delusional man.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Stuck in the Mud Blue Scene - Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - Movie Clip HD Scene" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtZSqc5LdY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Bullet Farmer (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">This is probably the maddest character of the bunch, an absolute bloodthirsty fool who happily dual wields SMGs into battle even though he’d just sustained an injury that rendered him completely blind. The logic behind his action seems to be that if you have enough bullets, you’re eventually going to end up hitting your target. </p>
 <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="119" data-injectable="false">He doesn’t, but his attempt makes for a beautifully operatic scene that no one expected to come out of such film.</p> <figure data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Aunty Entity (Beyond Thunderdome)</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">Tina Turner’s character in <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em> is a surprising villain for the post-apocalyptic genre. Instead of having always been evil, or having gone mad with the end of the world like so many in this universe, she’s just the result of corruption. She was a good person not too long before the events of the movie, and built her new civilization out of good will, but ended up becoming a bloodthirsty tyrant like so many others would become in her position.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The War Boys (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="559" data-current-count="859" data-injectable="true">I’m not mentioning any specific war boy because I see them as a hivemind, a legion of absolute maniacs who answer only to Immortan Joe. The War Boys quickly became one of the most iconic parts of <em>Fury Road</em>, as they immediately turned simple expressions such as “Mediocre!” and “Witness me!” into instant classics. They’re absolute mad men who strive to spend the entirety of their lives high on adrenaline, chrome spray and even on blood transfusions. They also worship a god who happens to be a huge engine, but of course.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-crow-fishers-fury-road" data-injectable="false">The Crow Fishers (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">The Crow Fishers display George Miller’s nearly <em>Souls</em>-y worldbuilding at its best. Though they look a tad scary, they’re not goons put there for a filler action sequence. They completely ignore the main characters because they’re doing their own thing. We don’t learn exactly what it is that they do or why they only show up at night balancing themselves on long stilts, but their tortured existence somehow never feels off in this world.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Doof Warrior (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="false">The Doof Warrior, also known as Coma-Doof Warrior, is easily the most visually and audibly striking character of <em>Fury Road.</em> The Doof Warrior is a blind and faceless man who owns a huge car that serves only as an amp for him to use his guitar skills to hype up Immortan Joe’s army. We don’t learn anything about him from the movie, but George Miller has since revealed that the mask he wears throughout most of the film is actually <a href="https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Coma-Doof_Warrior" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the face of his mother</a>. Some things are best left enshrouded in mystery!</p>

<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Indeed, the Titan of Time may be the enemy in <em>Hades 2</em>, but that doesn’t mean all of time is against you. Knowing how the passing of Time works in <em>Hades 2</em> is key in your struggle against Chronos.</p> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Time in <em>Hades 2</em> gives you a good idea of how long certain in-game activities can take, but it doesn’t pass by any traditional means. <strong>In <em>Hades 2</em>, time moves via a unit of measurement called “While,” which moves in several ways</strong>.</p> <h2 id="h-while-and-how-the-passing-of-time-works-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">While, and how the passing of Time works in <em>Hades 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">That passing time, or While, is shown as a small clock symbol next to a number in <em>Hades 2</em>. The number represents how many While(s) need to tick by before that activity is done. So, <strong>if you’re cooking up an Alchemy recipe that takes 8 While to finish, you’ll need to do something to make that number tick down eight times</strong>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Planting seeds in <em>Hades 2</em> is a common activity that requires time to pass, but it’s not the only one. Here are all the activities that need time to complete:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-plant-guide-every-seed-and-where-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growing plants</a></li> <li>Using Alchemy <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-hades-2-incantations-and-their-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Cauldron</a></li> <li>Ordering Charon rewards</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">There are ways to pass time while playing <em>Hades 2</em>. The first method is to, well, <em>play Hades 2</em>. <strong>Each Location (or room) you clear in a Region counts as the passing of 1 While</strong>. Since there can be around 14 Locations in a typical Region, something that takes 8 While should be done long before you face the Guardian. </p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">Some things do take much longer. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-do-charon-gold-rewards-cards-work-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spending Obol Points</a> to order 80 Psyche from Charon takes 40 While, for example. Finishing an entire run of the game should get you there, though.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true"><strong>The second way to pass While in <em>Hades 2</em> is by spending time with companions</strong>. After you unlock communal areas in the Crossroads, you can invite friends and acquaintances to hang out for a bit. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-hot-springs-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first area you will likely unlock is the Hot Springs</a>, which you can use so long as you have some Bath Salts and someone willing to casually strip down and chat. </p>
 <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="70" data-injectable="false">There are three hangouts in the Crossroads at which you can pass time:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"> <li>Hot Springs</li> <li>Taverna</li> <li>Fishing Pier</li> </ul> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">Using these areas spends some While. The amount of which is shown in details area of the items you need to invite someone (while in your inventory):</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Bath Salts </strong>– Hot Springs <ul> <li>Passes 12 While</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Twin Lures</strong> – Fishing Pier <ul> <li>Passes 16 While</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Ambrosia </strong>– Taverna <ul> <li>Passes 20 While</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="759" data-injectable="false">If you’re waiting on some sweet Fate Fabric from your boy Charon and you have a bottle of Ambrosia you’ve been saving for the right person, taking a trip to the Taverna can help you get your goods to you faster. I’d even suggest planting seeds when you have a colleague in dire need of a soak in the Hot Springs and then inviting them to chill while your Thalamus happily grows into an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-thalamus-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnerving, pinkish-white brain fungus</a>. What a good day.</p>
