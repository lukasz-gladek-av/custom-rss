            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24166379/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-ifixit-pro-tech-toolkit-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we updated our guide to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse">best gaming mice</a> last year, we had no idea Logitech would be rolling out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs"><strong>G Pro X Superlight 2</strong></a> shortly thereafter. Less than a year later, the excellent gaming mouse remains the fastest the company has ever made — one that’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Superlight-Lightspeed-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09NBWL8J5/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cmlwLZiexfy">Best Buy</a> starting at $136.75 ($23 off), an all-time low.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight">original model</a>, the Superlight 2 is all about shedding weight while simultaneously ratcheting up the polling rate. The wireless mouse offers a 4kHz response rate thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094746/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-4khz-polling-rate-update-firmware">recent firmware update</a>, along with a newer Hero 2 sensor that tracks at 500 inches per second (and up to 32,000 DPI). That combo, combined with the fact that the gaming mouse weighs a mere 60 grams (2.1 ounces), makes it ideal for esports PC players who desire high DPI / low in-game sensitivity. It also touts up to 95 hours of battery life when using its power saving modes (or 51 hours without) and compatibility with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powerplay-Wireless-Charging-Lightspeed/dp/B071WZ56G9/?tag=theverge02-20">Logitech’s Powerplay charging mousepad</a>, though, keep in mind that the new 4kHZ mode will eat up more battery life when engaged.</p><p>Personally, I have a hard time telling the difference between 1kHz and 2kHz polling — let alone a 4kHZ polling rate. However, I am a fan of the Superlight 2’s hybrid optical / mechanical switches, which still provide a satisfying click when pressed. I’m not a tournament gamer by any means, but if you want a pro-grade gaming mouse that will work great for work and play, it’s hard to go wrong with Logitech’s latest.</p><div><p>The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>More deals, discounts, and ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>Right-to-repair bills <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166894/colorado-right-to-repair-law-electronics-devices-parts-pairing">continue to sweep the nation</a>, but unless you have the right tools for the job, it doesn’t matter if you obtain the instructions and all the necessary parts.

Videos have also appeared on YouTube showing an early look at new weapons and gear that will be available next week.</p><p><em>The Final Shape</em> could be Destiny 2’s most important expansion, set to conclude the light and darkness saga of&nbsp;<em>Destiny </em>that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. It will see<em> Destiny 2</em> players fight The Witness, the main antagonist of&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s light and darkness saga who commands the Black Fleet — an armada of pyramid vessels. </p><p><em>The Final Shape</em> will also include access to a new Prismatic Subclass that merges the powers of the Light and Darkness, allowing players to combine certain class abilities from different damage types. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125357/destiny-2-the-final-shape-prismatic-subclasses-preview">Prismatic looks set to break <em>Destiny 2</em></a>, in a good way.</p><p>Sony and Bungie have now rectified the mistaken early access, but the damage has already been done. It’s a devastating leak for Bungie, just days ahead of the official launch of <em>The Final Shape</em>. Spoilers and gameplay are now appearing on forums, posts on X, Discord servers, Reddit, and elsewhere ahead of <em>The Final Shape </em>launch on Tuesday — making it nearly impossible for fans to avoid spoilers.</p><p>While we’ve seen plenty of game leaks in recent years — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/18/23359156/gta-6-leak-gameplay-footage-90-videos">early footage of <em>GTA 6</em></a> and internal documents and gameplay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">stolen from Insomniac Games</a> — it’s still rare to be able to play a game early thanks to mistaken server access.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Bungie to comment on this, and we’ll update you accordingly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation State of Play Games List Has Seemingly Been Leaked]]></title>

<p>The PlayStation State of Play games list has been leaked online ahead of today’s showing.</p>



<p>The first leak comes courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Shpeshal_Nick</a> on Twitter, who has been known to leak showcase games once the shows have been uploaded to YouTube. </p>



<p>According to Nick, here are eight of the games that will be shown;</p>



<ul>
<li>Where Winds Meet</li>



<li>Until Dawn</li>



<li>AstroBot (sequel?)</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarök PC</li>



<li>Concord</li>



<li>Aliens VR</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition to Nick’s status, <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1796143558111461597?t=gTVAUOuIT6HUQmg-E_SjRg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another supposed leaker</a> has also filled in the gaps with the other seven games that will be shown, which include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Marvel Rivals Console Port Announcement</li>



<li>A new Five Nights at Freddy’s</li>



<li>A new Dynasty Warrior</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Silent Hill 2 Remake</li>



<li>Phantom Blade Zero</li>



<li>‘A New Game from the Middle East’<br></li>
</ul>



<p>The leak suggests that the Horzion x LEGO game, which would arguably be the event’s biggest announcement (and therefore likely to be leaked), will not be shown. Presumably, such an announcement will be saved for Summer Game Fest in June or the PlayStation Showcase towards the end of the year.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Astrobot was already leaked to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-astro-game-announcement-coming-in-next-two-weeks-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in the coming weeks</a> as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s Concord title</a>. It’s currently unclear on when both games will be released, but Concord is scheduled to release sometime in 2024.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ceos-talk-live-service-pc-games-and-more-in-first-appearance-as-new-bosses</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-ceos-talk-live-service-pc-games-and-more-in-first-appearance-as-new-bosses.884730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ceos-talk-live-service-pc-games-and-more-in-first-appearance-as-new-bosses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Newly appointed PlayStation CEOs Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst have discussed the company's perspective on live service games, PC releases, lay offs, and much more in their first presentation as co-leaders.</p><p>Nishino and Hulst opened Sony's Game and Network Services Business Segment <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presentation</a> by boasting "each PlayStation 5 sold generates over $700 U.S. of additional spend, which is significantly higher than the previous generation."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><h2>Controlling Scope and Scale Without 'Compromising on Quality'</h2><p>To keep up a high level of game development Hulst said PlayStation is "increasing [its] use of external development teams, outsourcing partners, and co-development agreements with teams in lower-cost regions". He then insisted this allows PlayStation to control the "scope and scale" of its games "without compromising on quality".</p><p>AI is seemingly another way PlayStation is looking to achieve this. "We also see opportunities in AI to level up our own productivity and to enhance player experiences enabling us to better serve players and creators, create new experiences, and drive organization-wide efficiencies," Nishino said.</p><p>"Research and experimentation in AI and machine learning is a focus for us," Hulst added. "With work being done across a wide variety of our development tools and processes, we have a wealth of knowledge and experience forged from decades of gaming industry experience that will enable us to implement AI tools efficiently and impactfully.</p><p>"We have been realizing the benefits of AI in several areas, from assets creation to efficiency to accelerating coding to optimizing translation and localization processes, all while ensuring a responsible and ethical approach across the organization. We believe that AI holds great promise for the future of gaming, and we want to lead the industry in the adoption and implementation of this new technology."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Research and experimentation in AI and machine learning is a focus for us.</p></div><h2>Helldivers 2 Paving the Way Forward for Sony's Live Service</h2><p>PlayStation is prioritizing a mix of tentpole single-player games alongside live service games, going forward, but will pull from the success of Helldivers 2 and launch all upcoming live service games on PC and PS5 simultaneously.</p><p>"We are bringing our titles to the PC platform and we have a dual approach here on the live service side," Hulst said. "We are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day-and-date on PlayStation 5 and PC, but with our tentpole titles, our single-player narrative-driven titles that are, as you saw on the presentation, the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history, we take a more strategic approach. </p><p>"We introduce our great franchises to new audiences, and we're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing, for example, sequels on the PlayStation platform. We have high hopes that we're actually able to bring new players into PlayStation at large and into PlayStation platforms specifically. Actually, the same goes for the work that we do with extending our great properties onto other media such as television series and film."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are looking to extend the reach of our franchises by our focus on multi-platform delivery.</p></div><p>Speaking of that focus on delivering games outside of just PlayStation consoles, Nishino believes, "rather than cannibalization," this is an "opportunity for growth." Hulst chimed in too: "We are looking to extend the reach of our franchises by our focus on multi-platform delivery. That enables us to continue to invest these substantial amounts into creating world-class franchises."</p><p>Helldivers 2 is a prime example of this strategy, and, according to Hulst, it "highlights the strength of our live services efforts as well as the increased returns and reach we can realize by bringing our games to new formats and audiences beyond the PlayStation console."</p><p>This strategy won't be the same on all different platforms, however, as the team is taking a more "measured approach" when it comes to mobile instead of the more aggressive one on PC.</p><p>"PC is obviously more adjacent to the core of our development than mobile is," Hulst said. "Nevertheless, we're taking a strategic approach also in the sense of working with some of the leading companies in this space. We're working with various partners such as NCSoft and we're learning a lot from these collaborations, and let me conclude by saying that we're very excited about upcoming title releases that we can communicate in the future."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Industry Is in a 'Very Good Place' Despite Thousands of Job Losses</h2><p>In response to a question about the layoffs that have impacted the whole video game industry, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">PlayStation itself when it let go of 900 people in February 2024,</a> Hulst insisted the industry is actually "in a very good place".</p><p>"We're always looking to optimize the resource allocation on an ongoing basis, but I think specifically what you're referring to in recent months and quarters is probably a slight adjustment on the back of the windfall that the industry saw during the pandemic," Hulst said.</p><p>"So, that might be reflective of that rather than impacting the long-term growth of the industry, which I believe in general is in a very good place, but I see this as an adjustment of the pandemic years."</p><p>Alongside PlayStation job losses, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft closed a number of Bethesda studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> maker Arkane Austin, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> developer Tango Gameworks, and more in devastating cuts at Bethesda earlier in May 2024.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[Lay offs] might be reflective of that rather than impacting the long-term growth of the industry, which I believe in general is in a very good place.</p></div><h2>Bungie</h2><p>Elsewhere in the discussion, Hulst and Nishino discussed how Halo and Destiny developer Bungie is improving its business, despite <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-hit-with-lay-offs-as-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon-are-reportedly-delayed">several of its employees also being laid off by PlayStation in late 2023</a>.</p><p>"Bungie's network operations expertise has allowed us to optimize the performance of our upcoming live service titles, which is really great," Hulst said.</p><p>"We expect to see the full integration of Bungie's capabilities into our business operations by the end of this current fiscal year. We can't disclose financials for individual studios in our portfolio that includes Bungie, but whilst we don't expect a profit contribution from Bungie in Fiscal Year 24 on a standalone basis, that is obviously to do with the fact that they are working on a new IP that is yet to be released. </p><p>"It's really important to state that we are already seeing returns on our investment in the form of process optimization and capability growth across SIE, particularly in live services. And that was always the goal behind the acquisition, that it has helped us to progress faster. It's helped us with cost optimization, and then obviously with the upcoming releases of Destiny: The Final Shape and later with Marathon, we are going to see significant revenues coming in to SIE."</p><p>The meeting also revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-generation-represents-sonys-most-profitable-console-generation-to-date">the PS5 generation is PlayStation's most profitable console to date</a> and that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 sales have swung all the way up to 11 million units since launch.</p><p>PlayStation's big week continues today, May 30, as its gearing up to present <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024">its latest State of Play</a> that will feature "14 PS5 and PS VR2 titles, including a look at PlayStation Studios titles arriving later this year."</p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

The exception here is for live-service titles, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">something Hulst also made clear years ago.</a> Microsoft, on the other hand, launches many of its first-party games on Xbox and PC at the same time, and also as day-one releases on Game Pass.</p><p>"We have a dual approach here. On the live-service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day-and-date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles--our single-player, narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history--we take a more strategic approach," Hulst, the new co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, Hulst said the company would not bring its marquee first-party PS5 games to PC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">at least a year</a> after they originally debut. The exception is live-service exclusive games like Helldivers II, which launched on Steam and PS5 on the same day earlier this year. The Steam release went over positively at launch before Sony announced that Steam players would need to create a PSN account to keep playing. This was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">poorly received by fans and Sony backtracked.</a></p><p>Also during the business briefing, Hulst said with this approach, PlayStation is hoping that PC players might try one of Sony's single-player games that has already come to PC and then consider buying a PS5 to play a sequel. </p><p>Sony has released a number of its single-player games on PC already, including Days Gone, Ghost of Tsushima, God of War, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Spider-Man, among others.</p><p>Hulst also added that the same effort is true for Sony's TV and film adaptations--if people watch and enjoy, say, The Last of Us series on HBO, they might be encouraged to buy a PS5 and play the next title in the series. As it happens, Naughty Dog has provided a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">strong indication that it will make The Last of Us: Part III.</a></p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795966798942158935?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Hermen Hulst, soon to be co-CEO of Sony's PlayStation business, addresses day 1 PC releases.

			<p>PlayStation Studios will continue to focus on<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-delays-half-of-its-live-service-games-beyond-march-2026/"> live service games</a> in the future, with nine development teams working on them, as opposed to the seven focusing on single-player games with a narrative focus.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">Business Segment Meeting 2024 for its Game &amp; Network Services Segment</a>, Sony confirmed the names of the seven studios focusing on single-player games with a narrative focus - Asobi, Insomniac Games, Santa Monica Studio, Sucker Punch, Naughty Dog, Firesprite and Housemarque, and the nine working on pure live service games or hybrid titles - Bungie, San Diego Studio, Firewalk, Haven and Neon Koi for pure live service games and Guerrilla Games, Polyphony, Media Molecule and Bend Studio. The last remaining studios - Bluepoint, Nixxes, and Valkyrie are listed as partner studios. With more studios focusing on live service games rather than single-player games, we should expect more of the former to come out under the PlayStation Studios label in the future.</p>
<p>The focus on live service games, however, should not impact PlayStation's most iconic franchises, as tentpole titles, existing hit franchises, and new IPs with high ambitions from studios with proven track records of quality and success will continue to be a central part of SIE's focus for the future, alongside experimental titles that will showcase innovation, unlock new audiences and target new genres. These titles will be high potential games with discipline on scope and budget.</p>
<p>It will take a while to see if PlayStation Studios' focus on live service games will ultimately pay off. It is likely going to take some time even to see some of these titles in action, as today's State of Play is likely not going to focus on first-party titles much. For that, we may have to wait until <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/">September</a>, when a proper Showcase is rumored to be scheduled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-5-now-represents-50-of-sonys-active-console-base<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>PS5 is Sony's most 'profitable generation to date'</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has given an update on its console business, revealing that 50% of its users are now on PS5, with the other half on PS4.</p>
<p>In a company briefing, the platform holder said that PS5 is already on the brink of surpassing the revenue of PS4, and operating income is already bigger at $10 billion. In fact, the firm says that PS5 is the most profitable console generation so far.</p>
<p>More fascinating statistics can be found where consumers are spending that money. The firm revealed revenue per console is $731 for PS5 vs $580 for PS4, which is partially due to price rises (and higher tiers) on games, accessories and services this generation.</p>
<p>Spending on accessories is up 34% on PS5 vs PS4, services (PlayStation Plus, etc) is up 57%, while add-on content is up 176%. However, sales of games have dropped 12% over the previous generation, which speaks to the shift towards live service games and gamers engaging with fewer titles for longer.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the presentation, the firm says it's been successful in upgrading its PlayStation Plus userbase.70% of PS Plus users were in the basic 'Essential' tier in the 2021/2022 financial year, with 13% in the middle tier (Extra) and 17% in the top tier (Premium). Whereas in the following year, that shifted to 65% in Essential, 16% in Extra and 19% in Premium.</p>
<p>In terms of its games release strategy, Sony committed to continuing to build AAA single-player narrative games, as well as more experimental concepts, alongside its new push into live-service projects. It says that live-service games will launch across PC and console at the same time, while the AAA single-player titles will begin on console and come to PC later. The firm says it hopes people who discover these games on PC will then move to PlayStation 5 to access the next game faster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-invincibility-glitch-is-so-overpowered-its-basically-cheating/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiants-invincibility-glitch-is-so-overpowered-its-basically-cheating<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been playing <em>XDefiant</em> since its May 21 release date, then there’s a decent chance you’ve encountered an unkillable enemy who looks like they aren’t even moving. While this may look like a hack, it’s actually a glitch —one the devs are aware of. </p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">This glitch has been noted on numerous occasions throughout the first week of release, with players posting videos of <em>XDefiant</em> characters floating across the ground, arms and legs welded to their sides, eating bullets, and killing enemies. </p> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="187" data-injectable="false">There are other variations of this glitch too, as former <em>Call of Duty</em> pro player Scump discovered when he saw a player running around as normal but was unable to deal any damage to them. </p> <figure data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">These definitely look like cheats we’ve seen in <em>Warzone</em> and <em>CoD</em> multiplayer in the past, but surprisingly, <em>XDefiant</em> developer and former <em>Call of Duty</em> World Champion Patrick “ACHES” Price <a href="https://x.com/ACHES/status/1795882880221974590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that these are actually bugs affecting the game. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">The good news is that clearly the developer is aware of these problems, which should hopefully mean that Ubisoft will drop a fix soon. While we won’t explain the process here, the glitch is fairly easy to replicate, which is a big concern and could drive players away if it isn’t fixed quickly enough. </p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">At least the positive note is that the BattlEye anti-cheat system appears to be working, with hacking not a huge issue so far. With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/activision-finally-takes-down-call-of-dutys-biggest-cheat-provider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EngineOwning now paying $14m in damages to Activision</a>, let’s hope that cheat providers have been scared away by the possible ramifications. </p>

            <p>Soon-to-be PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst has shed more light on the company's strategy for bringing its games to PC.</p>
<p>Speaking as part of this morning's business segment meeting and investor presentation, Hulst stated live service titles will be released day and date on PC.</p>
<p>However, its plans remain more "strategic" with single player and narrative driven titles, as the company hopes this will entice PC owners to play any subsequent sequels on a PlayStation console.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>"But with our tentpole titles - our single player or narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history - we take a more strategic approach. We introduce our great franchises to new audiences, and we're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing, for example, sequels on the PlayStation platform."</p>
<p>Hulst said the company has "high hopes" that this approach will "bring new players into PlayStation at large, but into PlayStation platforms specifically".</p>
<p>"Actually, the same goes for the work that we do with extending our great properties onto other media such as television series and film," he continued, using <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elements-from-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-lost-levels-set-to-appear-in-shows-second-season">HBO's The Last of Us</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-film-review-a-marketing-exercise-filled-with-contrived-drama">Gran Turismo film adaptation</a> as examples. </p>
<p>
"That brings in new players into our franchises as well."</p>

<p>Hult's words come ahead of this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-announced-for-this-week">State of Play broadcast</a>, where we may perhaps hear more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-the-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc-leaker-suggests">God of War: Ragnarök's reported PC release</a>. Should these rumours prove accurate, God of War: Ragnarök will follow the likes of Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Days Gone and Horizon Forbidden West, which all made the jump to an additional platform after a period of console exclusivity.</p>
<p>Most recently, Ghost of Tsushima was released on PC. On its debut, Ghost of Tsushima surpassed God of War to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-is-playstations-fourth-biggest-pc-launch-to-date">PlayStation's biggest single-player PC launch in terms of concurrent players</a>.</p>

		<p>Stop me if you have heard this one before, there is going to be a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/just-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause </a>movie! Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto is set to helm the project for Universal Pictures with Kelly McCormick and David Leitch’s 87North production company, who are behind The Fall Guy, are also involved.</p>
<p>The Just Cause series began in 2006 with the last game, Just Cause 4, landing in 2018. It is famous for it’s over the top action as well as giving players innovative ways to blow things or just generally be silly, such as attaching large balloons to cows and watching them float in to the sky. The protagonist is Rico Rodriguez, a secret agent who originally hails from the fictional nation of Medici.</p>


<p>A Just Cause movie was announced well over ten years ago by Constantin Film, the people behind the Resident Evil films, but after many attempts including one with John Wick creator Derek Kolstad the license for the game lapsed and Universal snapped up the project. There was even a plan for an MCU style Square Enix shared universe in which Hitman, Deus Ex, Thief, Just Cause and Tomb Raider would all co-exist. Obviously that never happened and given that many of those games are now owned by other companies, probably for the best.</p>
<p>Back in June 2022 Square Enix casually announced that Just Cause 5 is in development. They published the ‘Outline of Financial Results Briefing by SQUARE ENIX HOLDINGS held on May 13, 2022’ which contained the following text.</p>

<p><em>We especially revisited our studio and title portfolios from the perspective of stepping up our offering of online titles that we develop for the North American and the European market. We want to focus on creating new titles that align with our strategy, including ones that leverage new IP. The JUST CAUSE franchise will remain our IP, and we are at work developing a new title in the franchise.</em></p>

        <p>Naughty Dog CEO was quoted as saying its next game "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony has removed its recent interview with Neil Druckmann after discovering "several significant errors and inaccuracies" and has issued an apology.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">page linking to the interview</a> published last week has been updated with a statement issued by Sony, which specified that a review had taken place and a decision was made to remove it.</p>
<p>"We have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects)," it reads.</p>
<p>"We apologise to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview."</p>
<p>In the interview, which was part of a Sony corporate strategy meeting, Druckmann was quoted as saying Naughty Dog's next game "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>
<p>Druckmann took to <a href="https://x.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1794187395279253837">social media</a> to address this, noting that what he said was misconstrued.</p>
<p>"In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost," he wrote, alongside a screenshot of his unedited answer.</p>

            <p>A federal court has awarded Activision £11.3m ($14.4m) after it ruled in favour of the publisher's lawsuit against cheat makers EngineOwning and Garnatz Enterprise Ltd, and 11 individual people.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/activision-wins-14-4m-judgment-against-call-of-duty-cheat-vendor/">VentureBeat</a>, the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-files-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-site">which was filed at the beginning of 2022</a>, accuses the companies and individuals – Valentin Rick, Leonard Bugla, Leon Frisch, Marc-Alexander Richts, Alexander Kleeman, Leon Schlender, Bennet Huch, Ricky Szameitat, Remo Loffler, Charlie Wiest and Pascal Classen – of profiting from cheats and giving an unfair competitive advantage to players prepared to pay for auto-aim and auto-fire software cheats.</p>

<p>At the time, Activision said it sought "to put a stop to unlawful conduct by an organisation that is distributing and selling for profit numerous malicious software products designed to enable members of the public to gain unfair competitive advantages", and described EngineOwning as a "German business entity... engaged in the development, sale, distribution, marketing, and exploitation of a portfolio of malicious cheats and hacks for popular online multiplayer games, most prominently the COD Games".</p>
<p>After issuing the default judgement against the defendants, US District Court Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in California also issued an injunction against the cheating site.</p>
<p>In related news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-court-battle-against-destiny-cheat-site-aimjunkies">Bungie has also recently won a cheating lawsuit, this one against cheat and mod site, AimJunkies</a>.</p>
<p>AimJunkies, aka Phoenix Digital, was instructed to pay the Destiny 2 developer $63,210 in damages – that's the revenue the company is thought to have earned selling the cheats – setting a new precedent in what's thought to be the first lawsuit wherein a jury has ruled on a game-cheating case.</p>
<p>The jury threw out AimJunkie's countersuit that Bungie had illegally accessed one of its computers, but founder David Schaefer says they will "fight this" and appeal the verdict.</p>

            <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be available across all Game Pass tiers, Microsoft has confirmed.</p>
<p>"Upon launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members," a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer earlier today.</p>

<p>The company initially confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be coming to Game Pass day one</a> earlier this week, after the information leaked ahead of schedule. At this time, however, some wondered if Microsoft may use the game's debut to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-will-be-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-when-call-of-duty-is-added-says-industry-insider">change Xbox Game Pass' pricing or tier structure in some fashion</a>.</p>
<p>Since last week, Microsoft and Activision have been steadily setting the tone for this year's Call of Duty. A teaser site known as <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/">TheTruthLies.com</a> recently emerged on the internet, where visitors are able to fiddle with some buttons on a TV set. Each channel plays some mysterious footage, showing scenes such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024s-likely-teaser-site-sets-the-mood-by-blindfolding-mount-rushmore">defacement of Mount Rushmore</a>.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team also shared a live-action teaser trailer for the upcoming game, which you can see above. "If it's the truth you seek, look in the dark 🔥" the description reads. "The Truth Lies."
</p>
<p>It has previously been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">reported that Black Ops 6 will feature the Gulf War</a>. We will have a clearer picture of what's in store when Microsoft hosts its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">hour-long presentation dedicated to Black Ops 6 next month</a>. Here, we will get an in-depth look at gameplay for the next mainline Call of Duty, with Microsoft calling it a "dark new chapter" for the Black Ops series.</p>

            <p>The demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/schim">Schim</a>, in which you play as a boy and his frog that only exists in the shadows, is out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/">on Steam</a>. I’ve given it a whirl, and its pretty froggin’ delightful. The game has you progress through different scenes set in a chill, colorful townscape. You can switch at any time between boy and frog. The boy can go anywhere, but is frequently blocked by environmental puzzles. The frog has the means to solve such puzzles, by hopping between shadows naturally cast by the environment. They act like little inky puddles, and simply jumping from one to the other is a rare joy.</p>

<p>As someone who aspires to, but does not currently, possess the jumping skills of your average garden-variety shadow frog, I really enjoyed how sticky the jumping feels in Schim, although not so much that it feels automatic. It never drains the traditional freedoms of getting from point A to B, via very close bits of sky, of their juice. But it flows well enough so that it never really demands any sort of taxing precision. You just sort of plop about at your own pace. “I’d quite like to plop over there,” you think, and before you’ve had time to stress about it too much, there you have plopped. Plop your eyeballs at the tray-tray below:</p>

<p>Here at the treehouse, we respect frogs. This goes double for frogs that have forsaken the light. Alice O (RPS in peace) first learned of Schim through #ScreenshotSaturday, taking every chance she could to fling more frog at your eyeballs. "I enjoy games offering worlds as little puzzleboxes full of moving pieces to track and figure out how they might interact with other moving parts,” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-hopping-platformer-schim-emerges-into-the-light-in-july">she wrote</a> of Schim. And yup, there’s certainly a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman">Hitman</a> but cosy about it, similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a>. You can hop or just walk normally to Steam and Itch.io to purchase Schim on the 18th of July. The free demo is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/">here</a>.</p><p>

			<p>The launch of Red Dead Redemption on PC may not be imminent, after all, as the code strings mentioning this version of the game in the latest version of the Rockstar Launcher were likely pushed earlier than intended.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/997050-red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc/page/45/#comment-1072386940">GTA Forums</a>, Tez2 revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release/">code strings mentioning the PC version</a> of the popular open-world game were added early as a result of work that is being done on the launcher with the new branch, which was accidentally pushed to the public branch. As such, it is more probable that the strings were added to the dev builds rather than a build that is closer to the public launch, meaning that the release of Red Dead Redemption on PC may not be as imminent as originally thought.</p>
<p>Having waited 14 years already, a few more months waiting for Red Dead Redemption shouldn't be a long wait for PC players who have yet to experience Jon Marston's adventure or experience it with improved visuals over the original PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. Take-Two Strauss Zelnick did not deny the existence of a PC port of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc/">last year</a>, so it will likely be released at some point.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption is now available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, as well as on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. We will let you know more about the rumored PC port as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

        <p>Fighting Chance Games director Ian Ramsey on how further funding failed to materialise despite positive reception</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Drag Her, a 2D hand-drawn fighting game featuring a roster of real-life drag artists, launched its Kickstarter campaign back in February 2022 with a modest and cheeky funding target of $69,000. Yet despite meeting its goal, on May 15 2024, developer Fighting Chance Games <a href="https://x.com/dragherthegame/status/1790774142947532929">announced</a> the game's development had been officially shut down citing "a simple lack of funding."</p>
<p>Sceptics may wonder how a game that had met its Kickstarter funding goal would then run out of money, but for indies launching a Kickstarter, it's not uncommon to have a goal lower than the real costs of development as well as personal savings, in the hopes of securing a publishing deal to fund the game's full development. Whether or not this was clearly communicated to backers at the time is something that studio director and producer Ian Ramsey holds up as a personal failure.</p>
<p>"For us, the Kickstarter was specifically an opportunity to be like, 'hey, there's a market for this'," he tells us.</p>
<p>There had been about a year of development prior to the Kickstarter during which the team built a demo with just one drag fighter, but the crowdfunding money was essentially for funding a vertical slice "polished to the nines" that could then be presented to investors to secure more funding.</p>
<p>"It did open doors in that regard," says Ramsey. "We swung some grants from that. I think the failure to not be like, hey, this is strictly for a vertical slice, and instead promising something more that didn't eventuate is a fair criticism, and I feel really bad."</p>
<p>Yet on the surface, things looked like it was going well. Last summer, Drag Her was exhibited at the prestigious fighting game tournament Evo, where there was not only a small side tournament but also a 'Queen of Evo' pageant.</p>
<p>"I was nervous about Evo because it's a very masculine, competitive space," Ramsey explains. "Will people see this fluffy, femme fighting game as something that is of merit? And the response was overwhelmingly positive, which totally took us by surprise."</p>
<p>It may also have been because it got to stand out simply as an original IP in a genre that is historically dominated by a few series with a long legacy.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Every person we met [to pitch to] was basically an old white dude. You knew the conversation wasn't going to go well if you had to explain what drag is"</p></blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes, however, Drag Her's development had actually already come to a halt, with Ramsey saying the studio had "just out of money and we [didn't] see anything on the horizon." The game's showing at Day of the Devs in November was the same build as Evo's with a roster of three, with the aim of having seven drag fighters in the final game. This is the same 'skinny' build that the team decided to release for free on Steam following the announcement of the game's cancellation.</p>
<p>"I think it was the correct choice to have this as our little token to the world that you can still have fun with at no cost," says Ramsey.</p>
<p>However, that also means none of the drag artists whose likenesses were included will receive royalties. The game was originally conceived with the intent of supporting drag performers during the pandemic when live events were shut down. But Ramsey reports: "All the queens we talked to were so loving and supportive and they were totally understanding."</p>
<p>While Drag Her fostered a loving and supportive community, the reality was the team still needed funding outside of that. Despite taking every call or meeting, including a potential Xbox Game Pass deal and a last-ditch pitch to Netflix that would have turned it into a mobile game, no deal materialised.</p>
<p>Ramsey says the only concrete and consistent feedback he received from publishers was that there was a general weariness about the genre of fighting games.</p>
<p>"If I can be bold, I don't really believe the fighting games angle," he says. "I believe people saw the cast, that we're leading with an all-femme, queer cast. Every person we met [to pitch to] was basically an old white dude. You knew the conversation wasn't going to go well if you had to explain what drag is."</p>
<p>The team did try to seek funding from progressive-leaning organisations and publishers that would "get it", although Ramsey mentions one such publisher had a much lower budget.</p>
<p>"I think there's a perception that femme games are a nascent industry and so they deliberately look at small, maybe solo projects," he says. "You don't see the other side of the equation, which is sort of like $500,000 to $1 million."</p>
<p>But even though drag has become more popular in recent years, it's also come under fire from far right groups, with protests against events like Drag Queen Story Hour becoming more widespread in the last couple years. As to whether this had a knock-on effect on Drag Her's development, while Ramsey says the team largely flew under the radar as a small indie project, the drag panic being whipped up did change the type of hate they received.</p>
<p>"They pulled up the sexual deviancy card so there were added insults on top of just calling us 'gay'," he says.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>A demo of Drag Fest was released for free after development was cancelled</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As to whether that was another factor that worked against the studio when pitching, Ramsey adds: "I think that definitely scared investors off. For people who didn't understand what drag was, for them to see haters and increased scrutiny of hate further makes the cast and project smaller. It makes it riskier, and in the current environment, one more reason to be averse to risk is another reason not to sign it."</p>
<p>The ultimate disappointment was that the game was receiving signals of support, all apart from the financial kind. "I would 100% take all the opportunities to showcase again, but I feel like we were put to the front a lot because it was good optics to have an all-queer team showing an all-queer game," says Ramsey. "But ultimately having a good showing doesn't necessarily change the funding situation."</p>
<blockquote><p>"[Games] are far behind other mainstream media in terms of queer representation"</p></blockquote>
<p>Drag Her's failure to find funding feels like an indictment of the current state of LGBT representation in games, even though the industry continues to celebrate games that feature LGBT characters and themes for Pride each year.</p>
<p>It would, however, be fair to say that few games are as overtly queer as a fighting game with a roster of drag artists that would also be represented diversely, including drag kings, trans drag queens and drag artists from different ethnicities. And Ramsey's only more pessimistic in a climate of industry-wide layoffs that has also meant less investment for indies.</p>
<p>"I feel like with each economic contraction in the industry, one of the first things to fall off are initiatives that put diverse voices forward," he says. "The stakes are higher for people who are diverse or queer. For queer-forward games, it's going to be more difficult. I think we're far behind other mainstream media in terms of queer representation. We'll get a cool swath of queer stories on Netflix or at the movies, but I think it's still very nascent in games, and we're not going to see publishers come to the table, not while the demographics of the game publishing world stay the same."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he doesn't want this to deter other queer developers from trying to get their games made.</p>
<p>"I don't want our story to be the story, I want people to keep pushing forward because someone might find that right mix of genre and audience, someone might find a publisher that totally gets it, and that will move the industry forward. You have to try."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-is-out-on-september-12/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, during the annual Bigben Group event, NACON has unveiled the release date of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. The open world racing game will be launched on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. However, pre-orders (which start today) will grant a week of early access.</p>
<p>The new entry in the Test Drive Unlimited series was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-test-drive-unlimited-game-confirmed-to-be-in-development-at-kylotonn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in early 2020. The full title was <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a few months alongside the fact that it would be set in a 1:1 replica of a 'luxurious island'. As it turned out, that island is Hong Kong, which the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-solar-crown-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>However, back then, the goal was to release Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown in late 2022. Eventually, the game would be delayed to 2023 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-is-delayed-to-2024-but-limited-time-cbt-starts-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to 2024</a>.</p>

<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLVF-OMv44w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here's an overview from the developers:</p>
<p><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown features the most eye-catching cars from a variety of manufacturers, including the most prestigious: Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Koenigsegg, Dodge, Apollo and many more. But you'll have to work hard to earn the privilege of acquiring one! These luxury cars are not just a means of getting from A to B. They represent your ambition and reward your dedication. They make you proud. Remember, your cars are a reflection of who you are.</em></p>
<p><em>The possibilities for customization and style are not limited to your cars. Whether you belong to Clan Sharp or Clan Street, cultivate your style to impress others, stand out from the crowd and defend your clan.</em></p>
<p><em>On a 1:1 scale replica of Hong Kong Island, with over 600km (375 miles) of roads through dense and varied terrain, the best drivers will compete for the ultimate prize: to become the next Solar Crown winner and earn the respect and recognition of their clan.</em></p>
<p>Today, NACON also announced the foundation of a new department dedicated to Racing that draws upon the skills acquired through the studio KT Racing in over 10 years of activity and from the NACON engineers who design the brand's accessories. On that note, NACON unveiled Revosim, a premium brand that already includes a major new exclusive: the brand's first steering wheel. Coming with a Direct Drive motor, a GT steering wheel, and a set of pedals with a load cell, the Revosim range will be developed in the coming months and is already accompanied by a mobile application that lets players customize their experience.</p>

        <p>Unknown number of employees have been affected</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Staff at Intercept Games have reported layoffs will be taking place at the studio next month.</p>
<p>Numerous employees at the Kerbal Space Program developer shared the news on LinkedIn, including senior design manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/">Quinn Duffy</a> who wrote that the team is expected to be made redundant on June 28.</p>
<p>Software engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201337094156263424/">John Del Valle</a> and principal engineer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201328318204317696/">Mark Jones</a> also confirmed the date in separate posts.</p>
<p>"It has been an absolute pleasure working with this team, and you couldn't ask for a more dedicated group of developers who really embrace the Kerbal spirit," wrote Jones. "It will be hard to say goodbye to such a unique title and franchise, but all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>"This is a tough time for the industry, and unfortunately another great group of developers are going to be out looking for work."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Take-Two for further information.</p>
<p>The news comes after a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> published in May that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">suggested the planned closure of Intercept Games</a>, alongside UK developer Roll7.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-closing-its-seattle-office">A WARN notice was also filed in Washington State</a>, which detailed the closure of a Take-Two office on June 28 with 70 workers affected by layoffs.</p>
<p>Following these reports, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">IGN</a> that it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-roll7-and-intercept-games-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">hadn't shut down either studio</a>.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the publisher told <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>that its Private Division label will "continue to make updates to Kerbal Space Program 2."</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that their summer State of Play showcase will take place later today, Thursday 30th May, giving a look at a bunch of upcoming PS5 and PSVR 2 games, including some first party titles arriving later this year.</p>
<p>The showcase will be a roughly 30 minute stream, and will start at 11PM BST / 6PM EDT / 3PM PDT. That’s 31st May 12AM CEST in Europe / 7AM JST in Japan. It will stream across YouTube, Twitch and TikTok.</p>


<p>State of Play will feature 14 games, some of which will be PlayStation Studios titles. There’s rumours that one of them will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/25/a-new-astro-bot-rumoured-to-be-announced-soon-astros-playroom-sequel/">a new Astro Bot game</a> from Team Asobi, following on from the excellent and popular Astro’s Playroom, which is bundled in with every PS5.</p>
<p>Sony’s State of play will then be followed at midnight by <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1795228491539005800">Konami’s Silent Hill Transmission</a>, if you’re up for a late night gaming double bill. All of this will be a prelude to next week’s Summer Game Fest, with press conferences around that from Day of the Devs, Devolver, Microsoft, Ubisoft and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/psvr-2-pc-adapter-spotted-at-south-korean-regulator/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A PlayStation VR 2 PC adapter has been certified in South Korea, it’s been discovered, as the company works to make their VR headset compatible with PC VR platforms later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053&amp;ref=uploadvr.com">Approved in South Korea</a> at the end of March, the device has yet to be announced publicly, but was expected to be necessary after Sony announced the PC compatibility plan earlier this year.</p>


<p>While PSVR 2 connects to the PS5 directly via the USB-C port on the front of the console, this is far from guaranteed to be possible on desktop PCs or laptops. USB-C ports have become a ubiquitous standard across countless devices, but PSVR 2 has specific demands that might not be met by PCs without an adapter. Specifically, the USB-C port on the PS5 is able to combine sufficient power throughput, data transfer and video to get the headset working, but USB-C ports on PCs are often data and low power only.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if this adapter will be mandatory for use on PC. There was a brief period where Nvidia featured a VirtualLink USB-C port on their GeForce 20 series GPUs, and AMD included them on their reference Radeon RX 6000 series, though newer GPUs and third party designs have dropped this feature. However, early experimentation with PSVR 2’s USB-C connection on PC has demonstrated that <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/psvr-2-virtuallink/">it does carry signals for VirtualLink Alt mode</a>.</p>
<p>In theory, then, the only requirement for VirtualLink equipped PCs would be to install the software driver – there’s already <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/psvr-2-pcvr-firmware-update">limited PC support added into a recent firmware update</a> – while an adapter dongle will provide support for all other PC users.</p>

<p>The addition of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/official-psvr-2-pc-support-is-in-testing-for-later-this-year/">PC support for PSVR 2 was announced back in February</a> around the first anniversary of the headset’s release. “We’re pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC,” they said, “to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5. We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.”</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/just-cause-movie-production/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/20-years-later-just-cause-is-getting-a-movie.884628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/just-cause-movie-production/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Just Cause first surfaced on the PlayStation 2 in 2006, emerging as an ambitious open-world game with one of the largest explorable environments gamers had ever seen. It was an explosive title featuring acrobatic movement mechanics, intense combat sequences, and a thrilling story that saw players assume control of the enigmatic, charismatic hero, Rico Rodriguez. </p>



<p>In 2010, a follow-up title was released, with a third dropping in 2015. In 2018, Just Cause 4 – the most recent game in the series – was released, but sadly it was the worst-received game in the franchise thus far. </p>



<p>Now, it has been confirmed that after almost twenty years on the market, Just Cause is getting a live-action adaptation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-rico">Enter Rico</h2>



<p>Rico Rodriguez is one of the most capable characters in gaming history. Armed with innovative gadgets including a grapple hook, jetpack, wingsuit, and portable rocket thrusters – among many other things – Rodriguez swings, soars, and shoots his way across a different theatre of war in every game. He’s what I’d affectionately call a ‘toppler’ charged with freeing nations from tyrannical dictators, usually working hand-in-hand with rebels and revolutionaries.</p>



<p>It was recently confirmed <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/just-cause-movie-in-the-works-1235910913/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by The Hollywood Reporter</a> that a Just Cause movie is in production – but it has been trying to gain traction for more than a decade. The license has changed hands numerous times, finally landing in the lap of Universal Pictures and getting propelled forward with much more urgency, given the recent success of live-action adaptations of video games.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Kelly McCormick and David Leitch (<em>The Fall Guy) </em>are on hand to produce the movie, working hand-in-hand with Dmitri Johnson, Mike Goldberg, and Timothy Stevenson, who combined have worked on Tomb Raider and Sonic the Hedgehog. It’ll be directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, who was recently credited for heading up <em>Blue Bee<strong>tle</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The big question is: who can play Rico Rodriguez? Some names have been lobbied in the past, from Javier Bardem to Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and from Pedro Pascal to Diego Luna. To be honest, it’ll probably go to Chris Pratt.</p>

		<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will launch on 12th September 2024 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC in 2024, Nacon and KT Racing have confirmed. Early access will be able from 5th September for pre-orders. Check out the new release date trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/whwba2H7nNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">Announced way back in 2020</a>, it’s been a long wait for fans of earlier games in the series – the last of which arrived in the early 2010s for PS3 and Xbox 360 – to have a true confirmation of when Solar Crown will be released. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/07/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-announced-release-date-consoles/">First planned for September 2022</a>, KT Racing has been afforded a further two years to bring their vision for Test Drive Unlimited to fruition.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown will take players to Hong Kong Island, featuring a full-sized recreation of reality, with a blend of built up cities and the thick wilderness. There will be plenty of high speed racing to be found within this game and setting, and players will choose between the Sharp and Street clans that vie for supremacy on Hong Kong’s roads, but TDU has always been about celebrating cars and car culture, as much as the racing itself. The intention is for this to be more of a social driving MMO, in contrast to the car bonanza of other open world racers.</p>
<p>Prior to the release date trailer, Nacon released a trio of gameplay trailers that dug into the different styles of driving and racing that will be found in Solar Crown. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/explore-off-road-in-test-drive-unlimited-solar-crowns-latest-trailer/">The Explorer</a> went off road and into the hills of the island, following on from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bDjhsshRZY&amp;t">The Cruiser</a>, for more sedate driving around town, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04AkO7LJI2A&amp;ab_channel=Nacon">The Racer</a>, for the more competitive among us.</p>
<p>We went hands on with TDU Solar Crown at Gamescom last year, sampling its unique blend of more social driving and racing. “Yes, it’s a game in which you drive and race around Hong Kong,” I wrote in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-is-a-car-mmo-thats-about-more-than-just-racing/">our preview</a>, “but it’s also a game that will be best when you engage and actively share that space with other players. It’s not always about being first, it’s not always about racing rivalries, sometimes it’s nice to just hang out and drive together.”</p>

            <p>Readers, I appear to have locked myself in self-referential language matrix trying to describe the feeling of playing top-down <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z718S9mxdSXm7N4CWUSaY2to4JWZQaNxyXlbDzrDap8/edit#gid=0">action</a> shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kickback">Kickback</a>. You can only move through the recoil from shooting, you see, which means facing the opposite way to where you want to go. It’s both  very counterintuitive and very fun. To call something both counterintuitive and fun seems, well, counterintuitive. But also: fun. Which, as a concept is very fun to think about. But, also, quite counterintuitive. Writing such a incredibly redundant paragraph is quite fun, even though I’m just repeating myself. Counterintuitive, right? I’m going to try to escape this paragraph now. If I manage it, I’ll see you in the one below.</p>

<p>Phew, that was close. The last time something like that happened, I had to stop watching Lamb Chop for good. So, Kickback. The clue’s in the name you see. That kickback, caused when you fire either the shotgun or pistol you start with in its demo, is your only method of locomotion, or more accurately, propulsion. Oh, you may be driven forward internally by the banging Mick Gordon-esque soundtrack, all power chords and chunky electro pads. But we can’t run a horrific biopunk economy on <em>vibes</em> now, can we? Vibes won’t keep me in shell casings and supplementary limbs. Nor will they help me avoid the horrible spiked corners, like a bouncing DVD logo afeared for its, uh, life?</p>

<p>A few extra twists keep things spicy. You do damage on colliding with an enemy, but if they survive, they do damage back. But! You can get some of that health back by doing a kill. To aid you on your secret mission to fire a very loud shotgun continuously, you can hold down the button after shooting to ride the wave of recoil like a murder surfer. Google just told me there’s a surfer named Brendan Gibbens, which means I can write Brendan GIBbens and feel clever. Does this whip-smart wit extend to my Kickback skills? Not in the slightest. But I would like to get better. Thank you, Kickback, for inspiring me to something tentatively orbiting competency.

            <p>
Sony has called the PlayStation 5 its "most profitable generation to date".
</p>
<p>
During this morning's business segment meeting and <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">investor presentation</a>, the company revealed its PS5 generation had hit $106bn in sales. It is close to catching up with its predecessor the PS4, which generated a total of $107bn sales for the company.

<p>
Operating income for the PlayStation 5 generation, meanwhile, has surpassed that of the PS4, having now reached $10bn. To compare, the PS4 is sitting at $9bn.

<p>
Further in the presentation, Sony shared some statistics from its consoles' user base. 
</p>
<p>
It noted the PS5 had "established a significant install base" four years into its cycle, and currently makes up half of its monthly active console users. The PS5 and PS4 both have 49 million users per month, as of 30th April. 
</p>
<p>
Engagement on PlayStation 5 in terms of gameplay hours is higher with Sony's most recent console, however. Of the 3.8bn hours played, 2.4bn of those were on PS5. 
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image-(163).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>

Meanwhile, PS5 users are spending 176 percent more on add-on content, 57 percent more on services and 34 percent more on peripherals than the previous generation of console did in the first four years of its cycle. 
</p>
<p>
PS5 users are also spending 12 percent less on full game content than those on PS4 did.
</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Earlier this month, PlayStation announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino were to replace Jim Ryan as the company's new CEOs</a>. Ryan left PlayStation in March, soon after the exec announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">company-wide layoffs equating to eight percent of its workforce</a>. </p>
<p>
Next, Sony is hosting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-announced-for-this-week">State of Play broadcast</a>. Scheduled for later today, the show is set to run for around 30 minutes, and will cover updates on PS5 and PS VR2 titles, as well as a look at PlayStation Studios games arriving later this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-wants-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console.884613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-wants-to-pc-players-to-play-playstation-single-player-narrative-games-on-a-playstation-console/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation live-service titles will release day and date on both PlayStation 5 and PC, PlayStation's upcoming (co)CEO Hermen Hulst has said.</p>
<p>Hulst said as much during an interview as part of <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's Business Segment Meeting 2024 for its Game &amp; Network Services Segment</a>. While live-service titles (GAAS) from Sony's first-party studios will be released simultaneously on PC and console, this won't be the case for single-player narrative titles, according to the current PlayStation Studios head. As mentioned (<a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795966798942158935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> Tom Warren) by Hulst in the interview, Sony wants to tempt PC players to purchase and play sequels to single-player narrative games on a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>A rather 'interesting' strategy' as this would require PC players to purchase a console (if they don't own it already) to play a certain sequel to a game they liked. We're not entirely sure how this strategy will pan out, but we guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>As part of the PlayStation business segment meeting, Hulst also revealed that the current console generation (PS5) is the most profitable generation to date. While the monthly active split between PS4 and PS5 is identical, total gameplay hours on Sony's current-gen console are substantially higher. "PlayStation 5 has established a significant installed base four years into the cycle, and has increased to half of Monthly Active Consoles with higher engagement by gameplay hours", the accompanied<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> sheets read</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Releasing GAAS titles simultaneously on PS5 and PC seems to be the right route for Sony, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially given the tremendous success of Arrowhead's Helldivers 2</a>. What are your thoughts about Sony wanting to entice PC players to play certain sequels on a PlayStation console? Would you rather wait for the game to be released on PC instead of getting a console? Hit the comments below, but as always, play nicely.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about PlayStation's business strategy comes in.</p>

The actual reasons, though, are clear: OpenAI is making deals like this (they've recently reached similar agreements with News Corp, AP and the Financial Times) to head off future lawsuits,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like the one the New York Times is currently engaged in</a>, while Vox and The Atlantic's owners are also happy to contribute to their own ultimate demise by taking any money they can, even if it's from (<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/under-legal-assault-elon-musk-others-media-matters-cuts-staff-1904305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the many</a>) parties with a vested interest in killing them off.</p><p>It's grim! There's no way to see this as anything other than a huge win for OpenAI,<a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/ai-keeps-going-wrong-what-if-it-can-t-be-fixed-20240422-p5flo7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a company that keeps raising billions of dollars by promising things its machine-learning platform can't actually do</a>, and hoodwinking entire swathes of the economy in the process. To see journalism outlets--one of the few places we should expect serious examination of, if not outright resistance to, OpenAI's business model--roll over like this is extremely depressing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This agreement recognizes the value of our work and intellectual property, while opening it up to new audiences and better informing the public.</p>— Vox Media (@voxmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/voxmedia/status/1795830109238424058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Putting aside the money here for a second--while Vox's figures weren't revealed,<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/openai-news-corp-strike-deal-23f186ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the News Corp deal is worth a reported <em>$250 million</em></a>--what does this mean to the people doing the actual work at these outlets?

I know people at The Verge and other Vox sites who do great work, and a deal like this will hopefully at least help keep them employed while so many other media jobs are flushed down the toilet. No matter what those individuals think of the arrangement though, or even what they write about it (The Atlantic's Damon Beres has since <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/a-devils-bargain-with-openai/678537/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a pretty critical piece on the deal, calling it a "Devil's Bargain"!</a>), every time a journalist at any website with one of these contracts goes to write about AI, we'll be picturing Sam Altman standing behind them with a big novelty cheque. That's how ethics and the optics of ethics--often the same thing--work!</p><p>It sounds pathetically dramatic to say this, I know, but it's also true: this undermines everything the websites do from here on out, and cuts their good reporters and critics and video people off at the knees. It's a public signal that the human work of these people means jack shit to their owners, who are more interested in rolling over for the latest Silicon Valley snake oil salesman than making any real investment in journalism.</p><p>But this is the future.<a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> This is the only road corporate-owned media have left to stumble down</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-generation-represents-sonys-most-profitable-console-generation-to-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But half of current players are still playing on PS4.</h2></div><section><p>The PlayStation 5 generation is officially the most profitable Sony console generation to date, according to new data shared by the company.</p><p>This comes from the company's Game &amp; Network Services Business Segment <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meeting slides and presentation</a>, which were shared today following the company's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-sets-sales-record-but-just-misses-target-sony-predicts-further-decline-this-year">earnings report two weeks ago</a>. In the presentation, Sony revealed that the PS5 generation has brought in $106 billion in sales since launch, outpacing every past console at the same point in its generation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/most-profitable-generation-to-date-1717025772665.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>PlayStation says the current generation is its most profitable to date.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Let's stick some asterisks on that figure really quick, though. First off, Sony reports that the PS4 generation brought in a total of $107 billion in sales, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But the PS4 generation is taken as whole, from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2019, and includes three more years than the PS5 generation (which spans from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023). Four years into the PS4's lifecycle, it was still well behind where the PS5 is now, and the PS5 is on pace to easily pass the PS4 generation's total sales sometime this year.</p><p>It's also worth noting that these dollar amounts are total sales over the course of a console generation, not a reflection of specific hardware or game sales. The "PS5 generation" encompasses not just the PS5 itself, but everything the business is doing during this generation, including PS4 sales and game releases during this period. So take it all with the grain of salt it merits.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/29/most-profitable-generation-to-date-2-1717025772664.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>PlayStation is claming a stronger life-to-date spend for the PS5.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But it's not shocking that the PS5 generation has been so lucrative for Sony. Even with all the asterisks above, the PS5 has sold 56 million units to date. Though the PS4 has outsold it significantly (117 million at last count), the PS5 was more expensive at launch than the PS4. And continued software spend throughout the shared lifecycle of both has helped Sony's current console generation only grow in dollar sales even if console adoption is a little slow; Sony reports both the PS4 and the PS5 currently boast 49 million active consoles per month. </p><p>The presentation also points out that even with half the unit sales, PS5 life-to-date spend is significantly higher than life-to-date spend on PS4. DLC content, services, and peripheral spend is up, but full-game content spend is down a little on PS5 compared to the PS4.</p><p>All this is to say, if there was any doubt at all, the PlayStation 5 is doing pretty well. Unit sales are a helpful way to gauge player interest, but they don't tell the full story of how a company measures a console's success. Amid ongoing rumors that a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro may be on the horizon</a>, we may not be far off from seeing Sony attempt to capitalize on its current generation in yet another new, more expensive way.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's very strange to be sitting down in 2024 to play a brand new <em>Homeworld </em>game.</p><p>The first entry in the pioneering space strategy series, <em>Homeworld</em>, was released back in 1999. A whole other century! A spin-off, <em>Cataclysm</em>, came out in 2000, and <em>Homeworld 2</em> dropped in 2003. Since then--and that's<em> 21 years</em> for those not counting along at home--there has been a <em>single </em>new <em>Homeworld </em>game released, the ground-based prequel <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>.</p><p>Now, in 2024, we've got a whole new <em>Homeworld</em>. Not a spin-off or an adjacent release, but a brand new game in the series, continuing the main storyline, set in space, featuring big-ass motherships, the works. And after being very excited about it for a very long time, I've just finished the singleplayer campaign and have many, many thoughts.</p><p>The first three games--the original especially--have gone down as classics for a number of reasons. Firstly, they lifted the RTS genre off the ground and took it into the stars, asking the player to control units in a full 3D space, which was revolutionary at the time. And kinda still is! Despite being decades old, no other game (not even its successors/competitors like <em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em>) has let you fight a deep space battle quite as easily or elegantly as <em>Homeworld </em>did.</p><p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it was <em>cool as hell</em>. The ship designs for the original <em>Homeworld</em>--a game released in 1999--still look better than almost anything any sci-fi game, TV show or movie has managed in the decades since. Inspired by the classic sci-fi art of guys like Chris Foss, but adding in their own modern twists, Relic's artists (led by Rob Cunningham, who is now head of Blackbird, <em>Homeworld 3's</em> developers) created a universe of designs (and a slick user interface to boot) that have stood the test of time.</p><figure></figure><p>How do you hope to follow a legacy like that all these years later? In <em>Homeworld 3's</em> case, you don't. Well, you don't quite. While many fans would consider the older games almost perfect, it's been 25 years since the original's release, so there's definitely an argument that the formula could do with an update.</p><p>Blackbird's approach is to hedge their bets. There's still a lot of classic <em>Homeworld </em>here, and I still love it, but there are also new ideas for a new age, like some slightly different approaches to level design and a between-mission narrative that I don't love as much.</p><p>When you first boot up <em>Homeworld 3</em> and assume control of a fleet, the old magic is still there. The iconic art style, the control scheme, the map screen, comms chatter, building menu–you could jump straight from <em>Homeworld 2 </em>to <em>Homeworld 3</em> and be completely at home. At first, anyway. When you start running into land in the middle of this space game, you'll notice something's up: perhaps as a result of frustrations with previous mission scripting in a fully 3D space, perhaps just because it looks cool, <em>Homeworld 3's </em>levels nearly all have huge chunks of rock, ice and space station in the middle of them.</p><p>It's true, they look cool! And give each level their own identity and flair, which is nice. Their looming presence throughout missions means you can send your units <em>to </em>them, instead of just to positions in 3D space, and sometimes even attach to them, which sounds fun but in practice makes controlling your fleet in the midst of battle hugely annoying. Some objects are so big they've got tunnels you can send fleets through, to outmanoeuvre an enemy or lay an ambush, something which sounds strategic but which you also almost never end up bothering to do.</p><p>You can tell how much these new objects fuck with <em>Homeworld's </em>control scheme because the game actually has two setups you can switch between, one based on the originals and one modified to be more contemporary. Neither works that well, and the use of terrain in battles rarely feels like it gives the player what the designers were hoping for. The intent was clearly to make space battles more interesting, but it mostly just make a hard job even harder, especially when some missions <em>require </em>you to interact with ravines or space stations. It's a huge pain in the ass to just traverse around and over them, let alone make use of them in particularly cunning ways.</p><p>Another addition that's weird and that I feel bad for saying I don't really like, since it's something I'm normally crying out for more of in my strategy games: a fuller storyline and 3D cutscenes. From Relic's earliest days through to Blackbird's <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>, one of the series'<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrW4jkQdmjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most beloved trademarks were its wonderfully restrained 2D cutscenes; whatever they lacked in animation they made up for with detail and atmosphere</a>.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Homeworld's</em> story, told as sparsely as it was, felt as cold as its deep space setting, a perfect match for the action taking place outside of it. By keeping things so brief, it let me imagine the details, and kept the game's focus on what it did best: its beautiful ships and galactic vistas. <em>Homeworld 3</em>, on the other hand, opts for a fully cinematic approach to its story, with actual characters and a plot, and I'm sorry but it's all just a bit...dull. This is a universe whose focus used to be as broad as the stars themselves; yanking the camera down to ground level where we really only meet four characters robs <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s story of some grandeur.</p><p>Everything else is mostly the same old <em>Homeworld</em>, and that's as good as good news gets. It's visually stunning, striking the perfect balance between maintaining the series' traditional style while clearly introducing new ships and ideas, and as annoying as the game's terrain is to play, it's nothing short of gorgeous to look at, adding an even greater sense of scale to its missions, <a href="https://aftermath.site/paul-chadeisson-solstice-5-short" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were already one of the masters of depicting "very big stuff in space"</a>.</p><p>I'm glad each unit's little radio chatter is still there, the sweeping space contrails behind each unit is still there, and that none of the immense joy I feel setting a fleet of ships into formation, siccing them on a target then watching them majestically blast everything to hell has been lost. <em>Homeworld </em>has always been, and remains, the closest any of us will get to feeling like a bonafide Space Admiral.</p><p>Also great: the singleplayer campaign mission design. A defining memory of the originals was constantly restarting levels because of their cruel scripting (you'd think you had a mission beat then BAM, more enemies emerge where you can't get to them and suddenly it's mission over), whereas here, I'll remember the visuals and a score of memorable set pieces, like playing a giant game of<em> Frogge</em>r in an asteroid belt and--in a rare win for the terrain system--a covert stealth mission through icy ravines flooded by nebula clouds. <em>Homeworld 3's </em>campaign keeps things fresh throughout, and all things considered, I had a real good time working my way through to the final (very mild spoilers) boss fight.</p><p>There are things I don't like here, sure, probably more than I could point to in any previous game in the series, and at times they threaten to turn this into something <em>else</em>. But no matter the changes or their frustrations, this is still <em>Homeworld</em>. It's not quite the <em>Homeworld </em>I used to know, but that's OK; I have my memories of those games already. This one at least <em>tried</em> something different, and even though it couldn't quite pull it off, there's enough of the old spirit here to make me glad I got to experience one more journey across the stars with a Hiigaran mothership. Even if it took 21 years to get here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
