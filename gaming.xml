      </p></div><div><p>Following <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/bloober-team-launches-remosd-neul-serorehso-ovam-ceyerd-countdown-website">a countdown</a> that began on New Year’s Eve 2025, <a title="Companies > Bloober Team [118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear 3" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-3">Layers of Fear 3</a></em> for unspecified platforms. A release date was not announced. The reveal comes 10 years after the release of the original <em><a title="Games > Layers of Fear (2023) [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/layers-of-fear-2023">Layers of Fear</a></em> in 2016. <span id="more-1026895"></span></p><p>“Good evening and welcome to the <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary showcase,” Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno said during today’s <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event. “Some of you have been with us for a very long time. Others arrived later by accident, curiosity, or through a friend’s recommendation. But if you are here, it’s because at some point the story grabbed you and wouldn’t let go. For Bloober Team, <em>Layers of Fear</em> isn’t just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be—what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that <em>Layers of Fear</em> is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.”</p><p>Bloober Team creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart added, “<em>Layers of Fear</em> was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing <a title="Genres > Horror [820 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> into a deeply human experience. When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. <em>Layers of Fear</em> is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself.”</p><p>Babieno added, “There is a certain kind of horror that doesn’t come from what you see. It comes from what you feel and what you can’t stop feeling. For us, that’s always been the core of <em>Layers of Fear</em>. And nothing captures it better than the game’s haunting soundtrack. Its delicate melodies reveal the emotional heart of Layers of Fear, one colored by regret, love, and memory. We are excited to finally be able to share it with you.”</p><p>Bloober Team also announced plans to release a physical edition of the <em>Layers of Fear</em> soundtrack, as well as <em>Layers of Fear</em>-inspired books written by Polish authors and distributed by Foksal. The first book will be written by Marta Bijan and launch in late 2026.</p><p>Watch the <em>Layers of Fear 3</em> teaser trailer and <em>Layers of Fear</em> 10th anniversary special event below.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bloober-team/" id="1451">Bloober Team</a> officially reveals Layers of Fear 3, the next chapter in its psychological horror series.</p>



<p>Bloober Team previously teased a countdown clock that would expire on Valentine’s Day, featuring audio featuring a quote from The Sick Rose and a poem by William Blake.</p>



<p>The countdown clock was tied to the franchise’s 10th anniversary. It led to the reveal of Layers of Fear 3. The game’s tagline uses the same line from that poem heard in the audio, “Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>

<p>The Six Invitational 2026 comes to a head tomorrow in Paris, and it’s all down to just two teams: FaZe Clan and Team Secret. Following an intense tournament, the grand finalists are lined up and raring to go, but only one will walk out of the stadium with $1 million and the coveted Six Invitational trophy.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most valuable grand finals in esports, as even the second-place team takes a $450,000 check home. Let’s jump into everything you need to know about the Six Invitational 2026 grand final.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-2026-predictions-faze-clan-vs-team-secret">Six Invitational 2026 Predictions: FaZe Clan vs. Team Secret</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is a tough one to call at this point. Even though only <strong>two teams remain</strong>, they’re very evenly matched as we run into the grand final. The group stage yielded similar results for both squads, with Team Secret having the edge, but FaZe Clan shone a little brighter during the playoffs.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that it’s FaZe Clan’s <strong>third </strong>grand final in a row at the Six Invitational, which is impressive by itself. Last year, the organization lifted the trophy in Boston after wiping Team BDS in the grand final, making up for a tough second-place finish on home turf in 2024.</p>



<p>Team Secret bloomed <strong>heavily </strong>last year, securing the win at the Esports World Cup, but FaZe Clan remains the favourite to lift the hammer this year in Paris. The community is behind FaZe Clan, but it’s <strong>close</strong>, and both teams are playing on neutral ground.</p>



<p>If you want to tune in, the grand final of the Six Invitational 2026 will start at 17:00 GMT, and you can expect some huge news from Ubisoft before it lands.</p>







<p>What are you thinking? Will we see an underdog upset from Team Secret, or will FaZe Clan go back-to-back at the Six Invitational? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quests in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> often don't ask you to complete complicated tasks in your runs <strong>Topside</strong>. They're usually just asking you to bring a specific item back, or some just want you to look around in a specific area. But the quests, specifically the ones you get as you unlock new maps, are doing more than just asking you to bring something back.</p>



<p>They're helping you acclimate to the new map, and teaching you about its more important areas. That's exactly what the '<strong>A First Foothold</strong>' quest is doing when you first unlock the<strong> Blue Gate</strong> map. Speranza's gadgets and grenades expert, <strong>Apollo</strong>, asks you to visit several key spots on the map. But with no waypoints and only small descriptions of where to go, finding each point might prove a shade challenging.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will help you run through the 'A First Foothold' quest, showing you where to go so you can start raiding the Blue Gate with ease.</p>



<p><strong><em>For more guides on ARC Raiders, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-complete-guides-and-walkthrough-hub/">check out our complete walkthrough and guides hub</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">check out our dedicated ARC Raiders hub for all of our coverage of Embark's third-person extraction shooter</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>The 'A First Foothold' quest tasks you with visiting four spots on the map. You have to find an observation deck near the Ridgeline on the perimeter of the map, a communications terminal near the Olive Grove, reach satellite dishes on the roof of a church north of the Data Vault, and fix the roof plates of a Raider structure near Trapper's Glade.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, visiting each of these locations in one visit Topside will mean that you're trying to run around the entire map in one session, and doing so while avoiding ARC and other players successfully gets more difficult the longer you stay Topside, especially as more and more ARC are sent to the area.</p>



<p>That's why, depending on where you're dropped, you should try to visit at least two of the locations in one run. That's more than possible to do without taking the risk that you won't make it back to Speranza.</p>



<p>If you do want to risk it, then make sure to bring a hatch key with you, so you can still find your way back home once you've completed every task.</p>

<p>A quick way to know where to find the observation deck near the Ridgeline is to look at the map and place your waypoint over the 'ne' in the word 'Ridgeline' on the east side of the map. If you stick to the perimeter of the map, you should have an easy stroll to complete one of the four objectives.</p>

<p>Apollo's advice for where to find the comms terminal is unfortunately quite confusing. I'm sure someone at Embark feels like its location is 'near' the Olive Grove, but a better suggestion would be to say it is between the Highway Collapse and the Olive Grove. It's just about an equal distance between the two.</p>

<p>Like the observation deck near the Ridgeline, getting to the satellite dishes on the roof of the church will send you to the edges of the map. This time it'll be the northeast edge, right in between Pilgrim's Peak and the Village.</p>



<p>Walk around to the back side of the church, and you should be able to jump onto the roof to get to the satellite. There's also a structure at the front of the church that can get you up there if you're nimble enough.</p>

<p>The Raider structure in the Trapper's Glade is one objective you could probably go alongside hitting the comms terminal in between the Highway Collapse and the Olive Grove, since they are technically close enough. Just remember <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">not to lose track of time</a>, which can easily happen if you're trying to run across the map and do all of these in one round.</p>



<p>You'll find the structure just south of the 'Trapper's Glade' text on the map. Just climb to the roof and you'll be prompted to nail it down.</p>



<h3 id="h-rewards">Rewards</h3>



<p>When you make it back to Speranza after completing these tasks, Apollo will grant you three <strong>Shrapnel Grenades,</strong> three <strong>Snap Blast Grenades</strong>, and three <strong>Heavy Fuze Grenades</strong>.</p>

              <p>PC gamers were left scratching their heads when <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-everything-we-know-date-2000663464"><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></a> revealed its surprisingly beefy spec requirements last month. The recommended rig to play the open-world action game would need a whopping 32GB of RAM. No longer. The action-adventure’s developers have now slashed that requirement in half as the great AI-fueled RAM shortage of 2026 intensifies.</p> <p>The <em>Lego Batman</em> specs were a shock when they were first spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2012737400544350217%7Ctwgr%5Efd34a35d456b8d5e150c2e218cfc364e8e95ac5a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000668982action%3Dedit">on January 17</a>. They were immediately compared to the specs for the last Lego game, 2022’s <em>Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em>, which had a recommendation of just 8GB of RAM. That number had been multiplied four times for TT Games’s newest Lego anthology in as many years. It was immediately accused of being the latest example of PC games coming in hot and under-optimized.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The left is The Requirements for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</p> <p>The Right is the Requirements LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</p> <p>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE WE DOING HERE GUYS!?<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGO</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOStarWars?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOStarWars</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LEGOBatman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LEGOBatman</a> <a href="https://t.co/qYDmO3mHi8">pic.twitter.com/qYDmO3mHi8</a></p> <p>— L 3 M U R (@JakeTheL3mur) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeTheL3mur/status/2012737400544350217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The studio responded at the time by saying that <em>Lego Batman</em> was still being optimized but&nbsp;<em>something</em> had to be submitted on the spec sheet to get a Steam listing published so the game could <a href="https://twitter.com/zayinpriv/status/2013012344712937946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2013012344712937946%7Ctwgr%5E1f9eace8ea501c7d7ee38918cb2dfa71bef86d7e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Flego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-pc-specs-confusion%2F">start collecting pre-orders and wishlists</a>. It turns out TT Games was being conservative and significant improvements have been made. No one’s going to have to go out and buy another 16GB stick just to run around Lego Gotham when the game launches on May 29.</p> <p>“As part of our ongoing testing for <i>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</i> on PC, we have revised our recommended hardware specifications from 32 GB RAM down to 16 GB RAM,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">a new update</a> on February 13. “Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final. We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch. For more information, visit our product page on Steam.”</p> <h2>RAM shortage fuels spec retreat</h2> <p><em>Lego Batman</em> isn’t the first game to go on this recommended PC spec rollercoaster ride. IO Interactive’s <em>007: First Light</em>, out just days before on May 27, also walked back a pretty unforgiving initial spec sheet earlier this year. That game also recommended 32GB at first before later dropping the requirement to 16GB. Its VRAM requirement dropped as well. IO Interactive <a href="https://twitter.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">blamed the whole thing</a> on a miscommunication.</p>

 <p>To put this all in perspective, say you were someone planning on playing one or both of these games on PC. Your rig only has 16GB of memory right now, so you’d have originally needed to upgrade. If you’d done that last fall, the popular <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/product/p6RFf7/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3200c16">Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 CL16 Memory</a> would have only cost you $80. Now it’s being sold for double that at $160, at least when it’s available to buy at all.</p>

 <p>These AI-fueled price hikes don’t seem to be turning around anytime soon. Valve already blamed these spikes for why <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the Steam Machine’s pricing hasn’t been revealed yet</a> and why it’s now expected to ship later in the first half of 2026 than previously planned. <em>Lego Batman</em> wasn’t the first to budge on its spec requirements, and it definitely won’t be the last PC game this year to blink, either.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/producer-discusses-preserving-spirit-of-akira-toriyamas-art-in-dragon-quest-7-reimagined/</link>
            <guid>1436371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Takeshi Ichikawa, the producer of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dragon-quest-7-reimagined/" id="3414">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>, reflects on preserving the spirit of Akira Toriyama’s designs in the remade video game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest 7 was originally released back in 2000 on the Sony PlayStation. However, over a quarter-century later, the game has been reimagined in a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/square-enix/" id="87637">Square Enix</a> release. Not only have some major gameplay mechanics been overhauled, but the 2D visuals have been overhauled as well.</p>



<p>The original game featured art by the legendary Akira Toriyama, and it was important to the 2026 development team that the spirit of that art style be preserved to remain faithful to the original drawings.</p>







<h2 id="h-preserving-the-spirit-of-toriyama-s-original-work-on-dragon-quest-7-was-essential">Preserving the Spirit of Toriyama’s Original Work on Dragon Quest 7 Was Essential</h2>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-producer-says-square-enix-tried-to-convey-the-cuteness-of-legendary-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyamas-original-designs-without-compromising-the-jrpgs-unique-atmosphere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Takeshi Ichikawa discussed the importance of preserving the cuteness of Toriyama’s designs while still capturing the game’s atmosphere for a modern audience. As for the direction of modern art, Ichikawa noted that current movies and games featuring doll designs had been well received, so they chose to combine that with Toriyama’s original designs.</p>



<p>“We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to our decision to move forward with the hand-crafted aesthetic,” he said.</p>







<p>The remake has been well-received. It currently has an 83 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic </a>score and a 7.6 user score on the platform.</p>

              <p><span>The most memorable experience I’ve ever had with a captcha, those li’l online tests you have to complete to prove you aren’t a bot trying to DDOS someone’s blog, was being shown a puzzle grid that used images of the building I was currently sitting in.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/dead-by-daylight/" id="741">Dead by Daylight</a>, the popular co-op survival horror game from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/behaviour-interactive/" id="1742">Behaviour Interactive</a>, is being adapted into a film. The <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dead-by-daylight-movie-adaptation-writers-1236505104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood Reporter</a> has confirmed that Blumhouse-Atomic Monster has selected David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, known for his work on The Conjuring series, and Alexandre Aja as writers for the upcoming adaptation.</p>



<p>Alexandre Aja has writing credits, including 2006’s “The Hills Have Eyes,” but he’s also known for his directorial work. According to the report, he’s not directing this film because he’s slated to direct Under Paris 2 at Netflix. Therefore, Dead by Daylight is still looking for a director.</p>







<h2 id="h-blumhouse-founder-is-confident-in-choice-for-dead-by-daylight-writers">Blumhouse Founder Is Confident in Choice For Dead by Daylight Writers</h2>



<p>Jason Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse, praised Aja and McGoldrick in a statement. He said the pair offers a rare balance of character-focused storytelling and genre intensity. He also dubbed the pairing an excellent blueprint for attracting prospective directors.</p>



<p>“Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale,” said Blum.</p>







<h2 id="h-video-game-adaptations-are-all-the-rage">Video Game Adaptations Are All the Rage</h2>



<p>Dead by Daylight is just one of many video games currently being adapted for film and TV. Sega’s House of the Dead franchise is slated for a new movie release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/house-of-the-dead-movie-casts-isabela-merced-in-lead-role/" id="174954">starring Isabela Merced</a>. Additionally, the God of War franchise is being adapted into a TV show on Prime Video. That series has already been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" id="161464">greenlit for a second season.</a></p>



<p>Also, Sega has announced that many of its classic franchises, including Streets of Rage and Shinobi, will receive animated adaptations. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/streets-of-rage-shinobi-outrun-getting-animated-adaptations/" id="176639">this link.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sega-genesis-hideki-sato-dies-dreamcast-2000668977</link>
            <guid>1436335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>“We knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development,” </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/"><span>Hideki Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> in an oral history of Sega. “They sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes.” Sato was a steward to Sega’s biggest consoles, from the original SG-1000 right through to the Dreamcast. The storied engineer passed away this Friday, February 13, 2026, at age 77.</span></p> <p><span>Joining Sega back in 1971, Sato saw the company go through every transformation firsthand, from a U.S.-based electronics enterprise to a Japanese gaming power-house, and from a titan of the arcade hall to one of the fiercest competitors of the home console wars. While involved in the original SG series and the Master System, Sato’s star ascended in 1989 when he was promoted to director of Sega’s Research and Development department. There he and his team were tasked with a herculean feat: take down Nintendo.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The Nintendo Entertainment System crushed Sega’s Master System. The NES rose from the ashes of the early ‘80s crash and dominated markets around the world. Sega wanted to get revenge in the second round. For the 16-bit era, they’d introduce something that synthesized their arcade strengths with what was possible at home with new, budget-friendly microchips. Sato wanted a home console with the visual appeal of an up-scale sound system, making it sleek, rounded and black with contrasted gold lettering. “That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive,” Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The result was the Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America. With a two-year head start on the Super Nintendo, the console was a massive hit even before the debut of </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>Sato oversaw all of Sega’s classic systems. The Mega Drive made Sega a household name, showing off what they did that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7nsBoqJ6s8"><span>‘Nintendon’t.’</span></a><span> The uncanny Sega Saturn was the world’s peek at the true potential of a dedicated 3D, CD-based console. And of course Sega’s swan song, the Dreamcast, ended up being a beloved underdog whose hard shake didn’t stop it from hosting the loudest, most uncompromising games of the era.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even beyond the heat of the console wars, Sato’s influence on the gaming world was felt in immeasurable ways. Magazine </span><i><span>Beep21</span></i><span> had already been compiling a new book about </span><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/1924655482024952281"><span>Sato and Sega’s hardware legacy</span></a><span>. Just last December, Sega co-founder David Rosen also </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies"><span>passed away at 95</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <guid>1436332</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In Rainbow Six esports fashion, Ubisoft has used the biggest stage in the space, at the Six Invitational, to announce the setting for <strong>the next Six Invitational</strong>. As the action unfolds in Paris, France, the team took it upon themselves to declare <strong>Brazil</strong> the spot for next year’s Six Invitational, one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business.</p>



<p>This will be the <strong>second </strong>Six Invitational to hit Brazil in three years, with the 2024 event taking place in Sao Paolo and setting a record as one of the most-viewed events in the game’s history.</p>







<h2 id="h-six-invitational-goes-back-to-brazil">Six Invitational Goes Back to Brazil</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational is wrapping up in Paris, France, tomorrow, and it has been one hell of a tournament thus far. It’s the first Six Invitational to land in Paris since 2021, and the European fans have been <strong>very </strong>receptive to the power of the event.</p>



<p>In a new press release, Ubisoft and BLAST unveiled a reinvigorated, three-year partnership, pushing further into an alignment that has proved fruitful over the last few years. BLAST will host the next Rainbow Six Major events, which were <strong>also </strong>revealed today:</p>



<ul>
<li>Salt Lake City R6 Major: May 8 – 17, 2026</li>



<li>Japan R6 Major: November 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on the announcement, the CEO of BLAST, Robbie Douek, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past three years, BLAST and Ubisoft have worked side-by-side to elevate Rainbow Six esports on a global scale, from unforgettable live events to a more competitive and connected ecosystem. Renewing this partnership was a natural next step and sends a strong positive message to fans of BLAST Rainbow 6, and the competitive entertainment industry. </p>



<p>With incredible destinations confirmed for the 2026/27 season and exciting plans ahead for the ecosystem, we’re excited to continue in our mission to elevate and improve BLAST Rainbow Six Esports for fans, players, teams and brands.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, Francois-Xavier Deniele, the VP of Marketing &amp; Esports (Rainbow Six) at Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Renewing our partnership with BLAST is a strong vote of confidence in what we’ve built together over the past three years, and in where we want to take Rainbow Six esports next. With a unified global structure for 2026, new event destinations across the US, Japan, and Brazil, and the CNL joining as a fully integrated region, we’re creating a clearer competitive journey for teams and a stronger, more consistent experience for fans. </p>



<p>We’re excited to keep innovating, investing in the live product, and growing the ecosystem sustainably for the long term.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Last year, Deniele went on record talking about the immense success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/" id="1507">Rainbow Six Siege</a> as an esports game. He was part of the crew suggesting there’s a <strong>very long </strong>and lucrative road ahead for the game, which Ubisoft wants to become an ‘annual billionaire’ franchise.</p>

<p>Another week draws to a close, but how was it for you? Did you enjoy Valentine’s Day? Or did you miss a day of the NYT Connections puzzle and now your streak is lost, and you’re inconsolable? Whatever happened, I’m back again with another round of NYT Connections hints to help you wrap things up quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections answers and tips.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-15">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 15)</h2>

              <p>Saudi Arabia’s appetite for gaming consolidation is reportedly unsated. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Its leveraged buyout to take over <em>Battlefield 6</em> publisher Electronic Arts</a> isn’t even complete yet and it’s already eyeing other major deals, according <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/">to <em>Reuters</em></a>. This time the target is TikTok owner ByteDance’s gaming subsidiary Moonton which could sell for as much as $7 billion.</p> <p><em>Reuters</em> reports that the “broad terms” of the transaction are already agreed upon, with the official deal possibly getting announced as early as March (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-biggest-gaming-buyouts-in-history-is-reportedly-underway/1100-6538177/"><em>GameSpot</em></a>). ByteDance purchased Moonton back in 2021 for $4 billion and Saudi Arabia, through its game investment vehicle Savvy Games Group, is apparently willing to pay over 50 percent more than that just a few years later.</p>

 <p>So what the hell does Moonton make to justify that spiking valuation at a time when so many other parts of the game industry are financially plateauing? The Shanghai-based subsidiary’s biggest game is the 2016 MOBA <i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</i> which has been downloaded over a billion times. Last year it also launched the auto battler <em>Magic Chess: Go Go</em>, the RPG <em>Silver and Blood</em>, and the coop vertical shooter <em>Acecraft</em>.</p>   <p>That last game is a thinly-veiled remix of <em>Cuphead</em> and features cartoon icons like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tom, and Jerry as fighter pilots. Some players feel like it’s essentially a microtransaction casino dressed up in the retro animation stylings of Studio MDHR’s hit 2017 indie action platformer. Weirdly, the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acecraft/comments/1qgxfrw/acecraft_temporarily_suspended_in_us/">randomly went offline</a> for all U.S. players starting last month. Moonton promised make-up rewards once it returns but it’s still mysteriously MIA.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia corners the mobile gaming market</h2> <p>A $6-$7 billion sale price would make Moonton one of the top-10 biggest gaming acquisitions in history, but it’s hardly the only mobile titan Saudi Arabia has sought to gobble up in recent years. Savvy Games Group also purchased Monopoly Go maker Scopely in 2023 for $4.9 billion and Pokémon Go maker Niantic in 2025 for $3.5 billion.</p>

 <p>The EA acquisition still dwarfs those, but won’t be complete until sometime over the summer. While the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Sims</em> publisher’s board of directors and shareholders overwhelmingly approved a historic $55 billion deal to take EA private, unions and Democrats in Congress have called for investigations and regulatory due diligence before one of the largest American gaming companies is sold to a foreign government.</p> <p>Given Saudi Arabia’s direct line to the White House via President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who reportedly helped broker the deal and has a personal stake in it via <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">his own Saudi-backed investment group</a>, that seems unlikely to happen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon EUIC takes place in London this weekend, and just like previous events, the closing ceremony will provide some big indications of future events, and potentially more.</p>



<p>EUIC is another big one in 2026, with attention starting to turn towards Worlds in San Francisco in August, and players will be able to book their spot based on their performances. More importantly, however, is the move to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a> for VGC, and release details could be imminent.</p>



<p>If you want all the details on when the closing ceremony for Pokémon EUIC 2026 takes place and how to watch it, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-euic-2026-closing-ceremony">When is The Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Showtime. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the 2026 Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC takes place at 11 am PT on Sunday, February 16, following the conclusion of the competitive events.</strong></p>



<p>Sunday is the final day of EUIC, and is reserved for finals, and the closing ceremony takes place after the last of the events comes to a close, so the times are subject to change. </p>



<p>The starting time for the Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony in major regions worldwide is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">7 PM – Feb. 15</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 16</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-the-pokemon-euic-2026-closing-ceremony">How to Watch The Pokémon EUIC 2026 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The closing ceremony for the EUIC 2026 will be livestreamed on both Twitch and YouTube, so you can watch all the announcements wherever you are in the world.</strong></p>



<p>Co-streaming is also supported across the entirety of the EUIC weekend, so you can also watch the closing ceremony alongside your favorite creators.</p>



<p>All major headlines and clips will also be shared across Pokémon’s social media accounts, so it will be easy to catch up on anything you might have missed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-euic-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon EUIC Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>EUIC 2026 closing ceremony is likely to feature some big news about the competitive scene of the franchise, including upcoming events.</strong></p>



<p>Last year’s closing ceremony provided details on the Road to Worlds VGC events, alongside details of the finals in San Francisco, and similar details are expected to be shared this year.</p>



<p>Most important, however, is news surrounding the release of Pokémon Champions, which is set to replace Pokémon Scarlet and Violet as the format for VGC competitions this year. It has already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be the format for Worlds this year, but there is still no concrete release window.</p>



<p>While there is still the NAIC to take place in June, it has been widely expected that EUIC will be the final major event using Scarlet &amp; Violet for competitive tournaments, and the closing ceremony could provide key details.</p>

            <guid>1436290</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gtfo/" id="3598">GTFO </a>developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/10-chambers/" id="3597">10 Chambers</a> has confirmed a large number of layoffs as part of a significant restructuring.</p>



<p>Several staff members began sharing news of the restructuring on their LinkedIn profiles. Even Hjalmar Vikström, co-founder and former chief development officer, announced that he was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">entering a new chapter in his career</a>, one in which he will focus on developing smaller, independent games and prioritizing his health.</p>







<h2 id="h-10-chambers-remains-focused-on-den-of-wolves">10 Chambers Remains Focused on Den of Wolves</h2>



<p>The studio then confirmed in a statement to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> that a large number of individuals were “impacted” by the restructuring. In their statement, they stated this move is to ultimately ensure that the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/den-of-wolves/" id="3599">Den of Wolves</a> game becomes what it “deserves to be.”</p>



<p>“We remain focused on the vision of Den of Wolves. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels,” they stated.</p>



<p>The studio was formed in 2015 by former Payday designers. Den of Wolves is to be the return to the heist genre for many on the team. In 2025, they announced plans to develop a documentary video series. Titled “Do the Game,” the documentary will explore the behind-the-scenes development of Den of Wolves.</p>







<h2 id="h-mass-layoffs-continue-in-gaming">Mass Layoffs Continue in Gaming</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, discussions of major layoffs and restructuring are becoming far too common in gaming. Less than a month after the release of Highguard, Wildlight Entertainment announced it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994">downsizing the development team of that game</a>. Riot Games recently shared <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">a similar announcement</a> concerning the 2XKO fighting game.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is perhaps the most well-known studio undergoing a restructuring. A decision that has resulted in several games being canceled. Learn more about the canceled titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will continue to report the latest news concerning development studios.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>UK Discord users have raised concerns about the company's new age verification processes, claiming that while it had originally promised that "video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device", a change in service provider allegedly now suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Discord announced its new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">revealing that age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe</a> in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content." Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features.</p>
<p>Building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK, without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands, speak on Discord server stages, or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know.</p>
<p>Originally, Discord said that video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" – "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Discord's FAQ | <span>Image credit: <cite>Discord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, however, users in the UK have noted that Discord's FAQ advises British users that they <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">"may be part of an experiment"</a> where your information will be processed by age-assurance vendor, Persona. Instead of your selfie "never leaving your device", the information you submit will now "be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted". It does, however, insist that "all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used".</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PC Gamer</a> posits, we're not entirely sure why Discord deviated from its initial plan, but suggested it may be due to the fact that users have worked out how to cheese its other age verification partner, k-ID. But while explicit assurances are given that Discord and k-ID "do not permanently store personal identity documents or your video selfies, and the video selfie used for facial age estimation never leaves your device," no such assurances can be given to users funnelled into the Persona "experiment".</p>

</figure>
<p>That's not all, though; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1r49346/oh_good_discords_age_verification_rollout_has/">some users are also unhappy</a> not just with the age verification process itself and the security of their data, but also the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">people bankrolling Persona</a>, which includes the investment fund of Palantir founder, Peter Thiel. Palantir is the data and surveillance company currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>, and Thiel's name appears 2000+ times <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html">in the Epstein files</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Den of Wolves</em> was revealed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2023-tga-trailers-game-previews-1851082729">The Game Awards 2023</a> with a brutal cinematic trailer teasing bloody cyberpunk heists. Developer 10 Chambers didn’t reveal any gameplay or a release date but it got the shooter on people’s radars. Over two years later it’s still not out and the studio behind prior Steam hit <em>GTFO</em> is already facing layoffs.</p> <p>News of the cuts broke first on LinkedIn on February 13 when individual developers started sharing their layoff stories. “<span data-testid="content-text">This wasn’t on my 2026 bingo card, but here we are wearing the green LinkedIn banner for a while,” wrote one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filipblom_opentowork-gamingindustry-activity-7424851079118495745-vIEU?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected employee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 10 Chambers later confirmed the layoffs in a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff">to <em>Game Developer</em></a> and others.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“We can confirm that we’re taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be,” it read. “This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio’s co-founders.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It continued, “We remain focused on the vision of<em> Den of Wolves</em>. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels.”</span></p> <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">From horror shooter to cyberpunk heists</h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">One person who isn’t still committed to the upcoming multiplayer shooter is 10 Chambers co-founder Hjalmar Vikström. He revealed his departure from the studio after a decade of working there earlier in the week. “Next up for me is going indie–making way smaller games, focusing on health and family, and just enjoying game development,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/">wrote on LinkedIn</a>.</p>  <p data-testid="content-paragraph">10 Chambers released <em>GTFO</em> in Early Access in 2019 and it immediately gripped players with its grime-y and claustrophobic coop horror gameplay. It revolved around prisoners fighting mutants and avoiding hazards while completing opaque objectives in an underground complex. It was uncompromisingly brutal and gained a devoted following as a result, occasionally spiking to nearly 20,000 concurrents on Steam and acquiring thousands of positive reviews in the process.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><em> Den of Wolves</em> applies a similarly harsh formula to sci-fi heists, but with much more ambitious trappings. It combines the smash-and-grab break-ins of a <em>Payday</em> with a second layer of nightmare-fueled gameplay where teams hack into fleshy human mind vaults to retrieve the valuable data stored in them. It’s a neat concept that received decent previews in early 2025 but there’s still no launch date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">Buying more time for <em>Den of Wolves&nbsp;</em></h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><i>“</i>I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for <em>Den of Wolves</em> in the trailer–but no,” 10 Chambers comms director Robin Björkell said alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818140?emclan=103582791474302810&amp;emgid=499465877188510087">new community gameplay trailer in December</a>. “They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">The cuts at 10 Chambers come as many game companies struggle in an ultra-completive release environment where development schedules are taking longer and investment dollars are drying up. Wildlight Entertainment, the team behind January’s new PVP shooter <em>Highguard</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">recently underwent mass layoffs</a> just weeks after launch and months after a splashy Game Awards 2025 reveal.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph">“If you know me you’ve heard this before: Making games is hard,” 10 Chamber’s outgoing cofounder wrote on LinkedIn. “And these past years have taken their toll. But thinking back I’m proud of how we managed to punch above our weight and deliver GTFO. Both the Early Access release from a team of 9, and also the releases culminating with GTFO 1.0 from the bigger 10 Chambers team. I’m grateful for the friends I’ve made and everything I’ve learned.”</p>

It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the <strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibuypower.com%2Fstore%2Frdy-element-9-pro-r07" rel="sponsored">$1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fibuypower-slate-gaming-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-amd-radeon-rx-9070xt-16gb-32gb-ddr5-rgb2tb-nvme-ssd-black%2FJ3R75JYGZ5" rel="sponsored">$2,099.99 Slate</a></strong> — both of which are stocked with high-end AMD processors and GPUs that can tear through most games at 1440p with fast frame rates. They also come with 32GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of storage, along with a mouse and keyboard.</p><p>Digging into the Element 9 Pro R07, it features AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D processor, a Radeon 9070 XT graphics card with 16GB of VRAM (roughly on-par with the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti), 32GB of DDR6 6000MHz RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD built into the Asus B650EM Max Gaming motherboard. It ships in iBuyPower’s Element 9 Pro case, which has tempered glass on the front and one side, and features a 360mm RGB liquid cooling system. The system includes an 850W power supply, a wired mouse, and a keyboard, plus a three-year labor warranty and two years of parts coverage. The GPU will be shipped uninstalled, so that’s the only component you’ll need to insert with iBuyPower’s <a href="https://content.ibuypower.com/Download/GPU-Manual.pdf">instructions</a>.

The biggest highlight is that the Slate features AMD’s Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, which edges out the 7800X3D in performance (although both are very capable CPUs). It also features an AMD Radeon 9070 XT graphics card, 32GB of DDR5 RAM at 5,200MHz instead of 6,000MHz, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">managed to catch it <a href="https://t.co/Yyu0FaoDJ7">pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7</a></p> <p>— Folf (@itsfolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsfolf/status/2021749585111069152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>rallying $150 million towards it in 2021</span></a><span>. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>
