      <div><p>Today, Hero Forge launched a new Kickstarter campaign to add custom dice to their services. The aptly named Hero Forge: Custom Dice campaign has already found great success, reaching its funding goal within an hour of going live.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge: Custom Dice Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Kickstarter campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/heroforge/custom-dice/description" rel="nofollow">Hero Forge: Custom Dice</a> lets you order customized polyhedral dice for your home games. This customization is an extension of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-full-color-miniatures-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hero Forge's service</a>, printing custom miniatures of various custom characters. It is a service they have provided to tabletop players since 2014, bringing endless personalized minis to gaming tables around the world.</p>

The service can print any kind of dice: D4, D6, D10, percentile dice, D12, large or XL D20s. If you play a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a>, you can order bricks of D6s for your wargames. If you're more of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic</em></a> player, you can print a custom spin-down die to keep track of life totals.</p>

<blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/625502/amd-rx-9070-xt-launch-pricing-msrp-possible-bait-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Yesterday, reviewers agreed: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">AMD is finally beating Nvidia with its RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards</a>, assuming they actually launch with sufficient stock at their $549 and $599 prices.</p></div><p>But this morning’s launch, while better than recent Nvidia launches <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-launch-day-retail-stock-status-looks">in terms of supply</a>, may not have met that bar — and AMD would not deny reports that even the best-priced models of these GPUs are capped to specific quantities, after which they may be sold at higher than $549 or $599.</p><p>When <em>The Verge </em>checked this morning, major US retailers Best Buy and Newegg listed as few as a single model of each GPU at their MSRP, which sold out quickly, of course. Most cards are listed for a $100 premium over that MSRP, if not more.</p><p>Micro Center appears to be doing far better, with <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=0&amp;NTX=mode+MatchPartial&amp;NTT=9070+&amp;NTK=all&amp;sortby=pricelow">as many as five 9070s and five 9070 XTs</a> at MSRP and a website that claims they’re even still available for purchase if you visit one of its 28 US locations in person.</p><p>What happens next? It’s not unusual for each graphics card partner to sell a variety of fancier grades of the same GPU at higher prices with fancier cooling and overclocking — but retailers are now suggesting that even the prices of entry-level cards won’t hold.</p><p>“We have now learned how the recommended prices, also known as MSRP prices, work for the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT […] they will apply to a limited number of cards,” wrote Swedish retailer Inet.se, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/retailer-confirms-radeon-rx-9070-msrp-only-applies-to-first-shipments-price-set-to-increase-later">as documented by <em>VideoCardz</em></a>.</p><p>“MSRP is capped quantity of a few hundred, so prices will jump once those are sold through,” UK retailer Overclockers UK also reportedly wrote.</p><p>Even Best Buy seemed to suggest that $549 / $599 prices were only temporary. When we visited this morning, the Best Buy website described them like they were on sale, though the company has since removed the “save $80” and “save $130” you see below.</p><p>We asked AMD:</p><div><ul><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that the best prices on the best-priced cards are capped in this way?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that only a fraction of the best-priced models of 9070 and 9070 XT will be sold at their announced MSRP?</span></li><li><span>Can you confirm or deny that AMD has okayed any board partners or retailers whatsoever to raise their prices beyond MSRP after selling through a certain quantity or certain number of shipments?</span></li></ul></div><p>AMD would not confirm or deny. It did address the larger question of MSRP availability with this statement from chief gaming solutions architect (and gaming marketing boss) Frank Azor, though:</p><div><blockquote><p>It is inaccurate that $549 / $599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549 / $599 (excluding region specific tariffs and / or taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.</p></blockquote></div><p>On X, <a href="https://x.com/AzorFrank/status/1897668346298220588">Azor tweeted</a> that AMD is working to replenish stock “in the coming days and weeks,” adding, “MSRP pricing (excluding region specific tariffs and/or taxes) will continue to be encouraged beyond today so don’t despair.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-the-board-game-review.1127517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-the-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Not many games in the past decade have generated as much buzz in the zeitgeist as FromSoftware’s Elden Ring. In a time when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board games based on video games</a> are becoming commonplace, it was only a matter of time before FromSoftware’s behemoth made its way to the tabletop. Steamforged Games – creators of other major video game adaptations like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-the-board-game-series-buying-guide">Resident Evil</a>, Monster Hunter World, and FromSoftware’s Dark Souls – took up the flask to do just that. Now, after a highly successful crowdfunding campaign in 2022, Elden Ring: The Board Game (referred to as just Elden Ring going forward) is nearly in the hands of backers and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available for preorder</a> for everyone else. Rise, Tarnished. It is time to fight once more.</p><div catalogid="ded2258a-cbef-4998-acb9-d421d76514ac" id="216332"><div id="216332" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elden Ring: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board game</a>, meaning you and your fellow players progress through a series of scenarios, leveling up and improving your characters as you play through the story. Steamforged Games has created three of these “campaigns” for prospective Tarnished to choose from – Realm of the Grafted King, The Weeping Peninsula, and Stormveil Castle – with Grafted King serving as the larger “base game” and the other two as standalone expansions. These expansions can be tackled on their own or played after Grafted King, allowing you to carry over your characters and continue their adventure, growing ever stronger in the process. Depending on which box you purchase, you will have access to different classes, including the Vagabond, Samurai, Astrologer, and Prophet in the Grafted King (base game) box; the Hero, Prophet, Astrologer, and Bandit in Weeping Peninsula; and the Confessor, Prisoner, Samurai, and Vagabond in the Stormveil Castle box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game is an imposing thing, arriving in large boxes filled with fearsome-looking monster miniatures, hundreds of cards, cardboard tokens, tiles, and a plethora of books containing rules, combat maps, and scenario guides. It’s one of the most intimidating games in my collection, made even more terrifying by the fact that I only own one of the campaigns – I have yet to get the other two boxes or any of the bonus boss sets that can be added in. For such a large game, Steamforged has knocked Elden Ring out of the park in terms of production value, featuring some of the most detailed miniatures I’ve seen, along with great-feeling cards and sturdy cardboard components.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios come in a handful of varieties that do a good job of keeping things fresh, so you’re not doing the same thing back-to-back. However, not every scenario type lands as well as others. Narrative scenarios ask you to read paragraphs of story, choose different actions to take (potentially making skill checks), and then draw the appropriate card to see what happens. While these are well-written and I appreciate the inclusion of skill checks, this type of scenario didn’t do much for me – if I wanted to do a bunch of reading or storytelling, I’d simply read a book or play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By far, my favorite are Exploration scenarios, which excellently capture the spirit of discovery and the feeling of never knowing what lies beyond the next hill – something that almost defines the source material. In these scenarios, you and the other players explore a region of the map, flipping and placing random tiles as you work to complete various quests. Tiles can contain enemies, items, Sites of Grace, or other surprises for you to uncover and take advantage of. I’m a big fan of the “grow as you go” approach to map creation in board games – whether it’s in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill</a> or Clank! Catacombs – as it enhances both the sense of discovery and the game’s replayability due to the random nature of tile placement. These scenarios offer a balanced mix of everything Elden Ring has to offer – combat, story, and exploration – without feeling overwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining three scenario types are strictly combat-focused: Gauntlet, Dungeon, and Boss scenarios. Gauntlets throw you into incredibly difficult encounters with mobs of enemies and special rules sprinkled in. Dungeons are similar but culminate in a strong boss at the end. Finally, Boss scenarios – where you and your friends square off against the game’s true threats – are the ultimate test of your builds and teamwork. Between these scenarios and the encounters you stumble upon while exploring, Elden Ring is a combat-heavy experience, which isn’t a bad thing considering that the combat is really solid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat takes place on grids formed from ring-bound notebooks included with the game. Some fights require multiple books to be laid out in a multi-page spread, creating a battlefield where players and enemies move strategically in their struggle to defeat one another. Attacks with spells and weapons have specified ranges, but depending on the row you’re standing in, players can gain additional boons – such as dealing extra damage, modifying turn order, or blocking more effectively. My friends and I frequently found ourselves deep in deliberation over positioning, trying to survive the onslaught of incoming attacks. Alas, even our best-laid plans often led to our demise – because the enemies in this game are <em>TOUGH</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Basic enemies each have a card displaying their actions, with symbols indicating attack placement, movement, and other mechanics. It takes some time to get used to what all the symbols mean, but it’s manageable. Once an enemy has taken its listed actions – or passed if it can’t fulfill all the steps – its turn ends. That's straightforward and relatively easy to manage. Bosses, however, are terrifying. They have entire decks of actions, each with its own place in the initiative order. Sometimes, you get lucky and their attacks land last. Other times, they pounce on your party before you can react. It’s brutal and unforgiving, but thanks to scalable health pools based on player count, the fights never felt unfair. Every boss battle was exciting and full of tense moments where we held our breath, hoping to stagger the boss or dodge a devastating attack. Despite just being miniatures moving on a grid, the combat offers surprising depth and strategy that makes it shine.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven deck-building experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One aspect that may surprise players is that Elden Ring forgoes dice entirely, opting instead for a card-driven <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building</a> experience. Players play cards from a deck dictated by their equipped weapons, skills, and gear. However, damage dealt and mitigated – along with special effects like Bleed – are determined by a separate Attribute deck. Different Attribute cards contain symbols representing Strength, Dexterity, and other stats, with attack and defense decks favoring certain symbols over others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Character progression is a core component of campaign board games, and Elden Ring is no different. Similar to the video game, not only can you level up your class for new abilities, but you can also customize your character by swapping weapons, armor, accessories, and Attribute cards, as well as increasing overall stats through Trait cards. This is all managed via the Rune system, which functions as an equipment load limit. Your total Rune count increases as you progress in the campaign, allowing more customization. However, the tracking method is lacking – Steamforged provides small Rune cards to track your total, but they aren’t abundant enough for every player and add to the card clutter. A simple tracker, like the one used for health, would have been far more effective. As it stands, the best method is to track Runes on paper, which feels clunky. Hopefully, a better solution will emerge from the community or Steamforged itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Elden Ring’s strengths, my initial experience was frustrating – not due to the game itself, but because I started with Stormveil Castle, the third campaign. While technically a standalone expansion, it assumes your characters have completed earlier quests and starts with adjustments to gear, runes, and decks. This made it overwhelming to set up for fresh players. I strongly urge anyone interested in this game to start with Realm of the Grafted King.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Where to Buy</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXbpk?object_uuid=59c39b23-0b80-410e-8ab6-b923b8ed768b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Steamforged Games</a><em></em></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Mar 6, 2025 8:39 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Steamforged Games has managed to adapt one of the most monumental video games of this generation, and the result is largely a success. Elden Ring: The Board Game captures the spirit of exploration, intense combat, and character progression, while maintaining the challenge fans expect. Even with its blemishes, Elden Ring pulled me in with its fantastic miniatures, engaging tactical combat, and breadth of customization. Given Steamforged’s history of supporting their games, I wouldn’t be surprised if more campaigns and expansions are on the horizon. If you have a group of board game enthusiasts – especially Elden Ring fans – this is an easy recommendation. Just start with Realm of the Grafted King. Now, get out there, Tarnished, and see what’s waiting.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newzoos-latest-report-forecasts-anticipated-boost-to-console-from-major-releases-gradual-growth-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Newzoo has released<a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/global-games-market-update-q1-2025?utm_campaign=5745787-2025-Newzoo-Press&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-__Dq-HWVzJK08jsx_6t5jYPEY6DxXW-ixoHYynq9c2ftlODIAJQBurdpm-hpCBe74HoSVI9UKPBo2ONoLUJYJ5h29KoQ&amp;_hsmi=350466789&amp;utm_content=350466789&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest report</a> and has also announced that it has implemented new changes that will make the reports more accurate than ever. The company is dedicated to refining its data products so that all information provided about the gaming industry is trustworthy and helps provide a true insight into the industry. This has been achieved by improved data integration with Newzoo's Game Performance Monitor, as well as new acquisitions where they acquired the Steam Data Suite, which is now known as Newzoo's Business Store Intelligence.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>As a result of these new changes, Newzoo has created a new report that dives into the industry's global forecast and what comes next in terms of revenue and growth compared to previous years.</p>
<p>Comparing the industry to the last three years, it's set to recover as a whole, to a more mature "new normal." All three platforms (Console, Mobile, PC) are expected to return to growth. However, it won't be a massive amount of growth and will stay in the low single digits. Thus far, it's forecasted to be 3.7%.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The PC market is forecast to grow similarly to the mobile market in the sense that microtransactions, such as in-game cosmetics, loot boxes, and battle passes, will drive the revenue on that platform. Among the PC market, Fortnite and Roblox will continue to remain popular and get consistent engagement, with new content streams being released regularly. Growth in China specifically is expected to slow down, while Japan's popularity will continue to rise over this period.</p>
<p>While some may feel that consoles are dying out, Newzoo predicts that it will instead actually get a major boost, thanks to some upcoming major releases. This includes the highly-anticipated release of Grand Theft Auto VI that is set to release this year, which is triggering increased hardware upgrades. While the publishers aren't mentioned, those that are developing titles for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S expect that they will profit from the peak install base.</p>
<p>Thus far, console users are set to have a good amount of games releasing that will bring in a lot of revenue, including Grand Theft Auto VI. Most recently is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which has already proven to be incredibly popular. The Nintendo Switch 2 is also set to release this year, which means there will be some highly-anticipated games from audiences of all ages, including Pokemon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The mobile market has reached market maturity, where player growth has lowered significantly to below 3% annually outside of the typical growth regions. Eastern Asia has particularly low player growth compared to other regions.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-%E2%80%98exciting-things-planned%E2%80%99-for-starfield-this-year-but-remains-silent.1127427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems like a lifetime since Starfield was released, but it wasn’t even two years ago that Bethesda Game Studios’ space-based RPG epic hit the market. For many, the game came and went without too much of an impact, and for others, it was the title of a lifetime, positively bursting at the seams with untold potential.</p>



<p>I’m probably in the former camp there.</p>



<p>Recently, the team posted on social media, expressing an appreciation for the patience of fans worldwide and stressing that there are exciting things in store for Starfield this year, but the squad is remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-starfield-dlc-anyone">Next Starfield DLC, Anyone?</h2>



<p>In September, a year after Starfield was released, Bethesda published Shattered Space, the first (and so far, only) major expansion for the game. It wasn’t an overwhelming thing and it left some players feeling short-changed, but at least it was an evolution on the game that has kind of run stagnant over the last eighteen months or so.</p>



<p>The game that took 20 years to emerge fully seemed to run out of steam very early on, which wasn’t good.</p>



<p>If we look at some representative examples of how the world is treating Starfield, we can see that things aren’t looking too positive. On Twitch, the game peaked at 552,021 viewers when it was released, but as I write this, just 40 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>



<p>By contrast, Fallout 4 has 648 viewers, which isn’t much better, but that game is <strong>a decade old</strong>.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield’s player count has dropped by 99% since its release. Talking of Fallout 4, the post-apocalyptic RPG’s player count on the PC platform more than tripled Starfield’s count at the time of writing.</p>







<p>That’s part and parcel of the lifecycle of a single-player game, though – so I won’t be too harsh on Starfield for not bucking the trend.</p>



<p>Bethesda planned to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-wants-annual-starfield-expansions/">one major expansion</a> for Starfield every year, and given the track record for how early we heard about Shattered Space, we <strong>should </strong>have something on the board for the next expansion, but never mind. It has been almost six months since Shattered Space dropped, and we’re none the wiser.</p>



<p>But fear not! On <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the team at Bethesda Game Studios assured fans that all is well and that there’s something in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you’re eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we’re not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can’t wait to talk about when the time is right. </p>



<p>We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s bear in mind that the folks at Bethesda haven’t given us a solid update on The Elder Scrolls 6 in almost a decade, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Starfield? Let me know in the comments what you’re up to out there in the vast expanse of space.</p>

"Based on our experiences talking with other streaming platforms, we were anticipating having to do a custom build, but we didn’t need to," he said.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">when Nvidia categorically told us</a> that “no other Nvidia GPUs” had shipped, or would be shipping, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue">missing render units</a>? Well, you can imagine our surprise to read that the company’s RTX 50-series laptop GPUs might be affected as well, <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/GeForce-RTX-5000-Auch-Notebook-GPUs-sind-vom-ROP-Schwund-betroffen-10306989.html">with <em>Heise Online</em></a> <a href="https://www.hardwareluxx.de/index.php/news/hardware/grafikkarten/65685-fehlende-rops-auch-mobile-geforce-rtx-50-gpus-betroffen.html">and <em>Hardwareluxx </em>reporting</a> that Nvidia has asked manufacturers to check their laptops for fewer ROPs than promised.</p></div><p>But Nvidia tells <em>The Verge</em> there isn’t actually a problem with those notebook GPUs. “All partners continue to run checks as part of our standard testing procedure,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells us, adding that Nvidia will reach out to both German publications to discuss.</p><p>We asked very specifically:</p><p><strong>Did we just go from “no other GPUs are affected” to ‘“some laptop GPUs” are also affected?</strong></p><p>The answer was “Nope.”</p><p><strong>Just to triple-check, the “nope” means that no laptop GPUs are affected by the missing ROP issue, yes? </strong></p><p>“Correct, no further issues,” says Berraondo.</p><p>That’s a fairly categorical denial, and it sounds like laptop buyers can expect to find the full complement of ROPs in their Nvidia 50-series laptops either way — either because there never was an issue to begin with or because there’s no longer an issue now that partners will catch it during these tests.</p><p>Both <em>Heise </em>and<em> Hardwareluxx</em> have suggested that these tests are unusual in one way: some laptops may be delivered in April or May instead of planned March release dates. However, <em>Heise</em> also reports one other possible reason for delays: that “Nvidia only recently distributed the final vBIOS for the notebook GPUs,” according to Google Translate.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jackbox aims to launch a beta of the service on “one or two smart TV platforms in the Spring of 2025.”</p><p>Generally, Jackbox titles are offered in bundles called “Party Packs” that you can play on platforms like game consoles and PCs. This new native smart TV app could make it easier to jump into a Jackbox game, since you won’t need to launch the titles from a device like a game console.</p><p>To start, this Jackbox service will only offer a “small collection” of “ad-supported” games for free.

<p>Nacon held its Nacon Connect 2025 event on Thursday, and with it came the reveal of a new sequel to RoboCop: Rogue City called RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business.</p>



<p>Releasing this summer, RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business is a “stand-alone follow-up” to 2023’s game that will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>“The OmniTower is their fortress, violence is their language. Face off against elite mercenaries all the way to the top of the tower and uphold the law amidst chaos!,” the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>It continues: “When a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress, RoboCop must take action and put a stop to their plans to undermine law and order.”</p>



<p>Nacon says that players will have new threats in the OmniTower with every floor being “riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops.”</p>



<p>“Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man,” the publisher said.</p>



<p>Additional details including features, system specs, release date and more will be revealed in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Check out the reveal trailer for the RoboCop: Rogue City sequel  yourself. And let us know what you think down below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>While traveling throughout Mio and Zoe's fictional worlds, you might notice benches spread across the levels. There are <strong>six benches</strong> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> in total, and resting on all of them will give you an insight into their worlds in the form of a short conversation. It'll also give you the Sisters: A Tale of Two Besties achievement, so they're worth seeking out if you're trying to get all of the trophies. Both girls must sit on the bench for it to count, and you'll know it's successful if the cameras pan together and the conversation begins.</p><p>Below we've laid out <strong>all six benches in Split Fiction</strong> and precisely where to find them. Plan ahead with our guide as some of these can be easily missed or cut off by triggering cutscenes or parts of a level.</p><h2 id="Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</h2><p>The first bench is near the pool section, which is also the same area as the Mountain Hike side story. After landing on the hotel roof, head to the back and use the zipline to get to the next balcony across. On the left you'll see the bench. If you jump onto the passing car to progress the level, you can't go back, so make sure to seek this out before you go too far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454932"></a><figcaption>Neon Revenge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454932-neon-revenge-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><p>Before completing the Ice King palace puzzle, it's time to look for this level's bench. Go to the back of the room, and you'll find a balcony with a beautiful view. If you're not already in your human forms, shapeshift into them and take a seat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454933"></a><figcaption>Hopes of Spring</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454933-hopes-of-spring-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><p>After taking off your jet packs, you'll see a long window with a corridor ahead of you. Alongside the window you'll find the bench. You can't really miss this one!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454934" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454934"></a><figcaption>Final Dawn</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454934-final-dawn-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><p>In the Water Temple area of the level, Mio and Zoe need to split up to complete the water wheel puzzle. After finishing the puzzle, immediately look to the back of the area, and you'll spot a stone bench covered in patches of moss. It does blend in and doesn't look a whole lot like a bench, but walking towards it will bring up the prompt to sit down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png" data-ref-id="1300-4454935"></a><figcaption>Rise of the Dragon Realm</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454935-split-fiction-benches.png"></figure><h2 id="Isolation">Isolation</h2><p>After controlling the raft in the sewers, you'll find an area where Zoe has to jump into a large metal container. Before taking the plunge, though, walk around the outskirts of the huge trash piles to find this level's bench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454937"></a><figcaption>Isolation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454937-isolation-bench.jpg"></figure><h2 id="The_Hollow">The Hollow</h2><p>After jumping across the beams of light, you'll find yourself on a ledge. Immediately to your left, the bench will look out across the landscape. This is the final bench to sit on, so you should get the achievement notification as soon as Mio and Zoe take a seat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454938"></a><figcaption>The Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454938-the-hollow-bench.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you're familiar with the areas that Mio and Zoe need to sit down to earn the achievement, take a look at how to survive the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>, or how to cross the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-get-past-underlands-piranhas/1100-6529867/" data-ref-id="1100-6529867">piranha-infested waters</a> of the Underlands.</p>

                <p>When Activision revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4/" data-ref-id="5000-666086">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> this week, the company didn't get into specifics about whether or not the two-minute time-limit structure from the older games will carry forward to the re-release. Now, developer Iron Galaxy has cleared up the situation.</p><p>The original Pro Skater 3 included a two-minute time limit to complete a level's challenges, but this was removed in Pro Skater 4; players could freely explore levels and complete missions at their own pace for its career mode. When Activision announced the re-release of 3+4 this week, many wondered if there would be a time limit in Pro Skater 4, with confusion stemming from <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-NZ/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">product pages that mentioned a "two-minute format."</a></p><p>GameSpot understands that THPS 3+4 will have a shared feature set that aims to unify the two games. Objectives for players to complete will be based on a timer for both games. That said, the game has a Free Skate mode with no timer at all. The game also has Speed Run and Single Session modes.</p><p>Basically, this means the setup in THPS 3+4 is different from the original version of Pro Skater 4. The Free Skate mode in THPS 3+4 does not let you complete challenges in the same way that players could in Pro Skater 4's Career mode.</p><p>THPS 3+4 launches on July 11 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC--it'll also be on Game Pass at launch. People who pay more money can start playing three days early, starting July 8.

                <p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, and with no end in sight, members of the SAG-AFTRA union held their first picket of 2025 this week and further discussed why the issue of AI is so critical.</p><p>Resident Evil Village actor and member of the negotiating committee Andi Norris told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/biz/news/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-picket-1236328677/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that picketing paused for a period due to the Los Angeles wildfires and "everything that the world is dealing with" currently. But picketers returned to the WB Games offices in Burbank, California this week, with Norris said the aim is to ensure that people understand that the voice actors are "still fighting."</p><p>According to the report, the two sides have come to terms on 24 of 25 items, with the one outstanding issue being protections against generative AI.</p><p>Yuri Lowenthal, who plays Spider-Man in Insomniac's game series, said he wants the game companies to ensure actors that the voice data they've recorded cannot be used to "manufacture a performance that we had no say over." Lowenthal also stressed how compensation is a critical element in the ongoing negotiations, saying, "If you're going to do something like that, then we deserve a piece of that."</p><p>Another actor, <a href="https://scottlambright.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scott Lambright</a>, said they expect the rise in AI to lead to a future where there are studios that use AI and studios that do not use AI. "It's going to create a gulf in quality between art made by passionate people and, I guess the term is <em>slop</em>," the actor said.</p><p>Before this, Mass Effect actor Jennifer Hale discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why AI is an "existential" issue</a> in the ongoing back-and-forth for the strike.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with work stoppage spanning 18 months. Hale was involved in those discussions, too, and she said a key difference between the strike of 2016 and 2024/2025 is that the two sides had productive side bars without attorneys involved.</p><p>"My understanding is that in this particular negotiation up until very, very recently, they haven't been allowed to talk to each other. They can each talk to their attorney, and then the attorneys talk to each other. And until you have the people with the vested interest having the conversations, all that's happening is billable hours are going up," she said, referring to attorney fees.</p><p>The picket this week at WB Games comes not long after that company announced dramatic changes, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">cancellation of a Wonder Woman game, layoffs, and the closure of three studios.</a></p>
