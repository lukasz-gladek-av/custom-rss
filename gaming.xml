<h3>"a lot of stick" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Greedy Nintendo! Time and again we hear it, Nintendo are greedy! It is a line that gets repeated so often, I wonder if people actually consider what it means. Shareholders? Nintendo's dividend payments place them just behind Microsoft, as well as many other companies in the gaming sector like Koei Tecmo, Square Enix and Capcom. Executives? In 2024 Shuntaro Furukawa was paid just over a fifth of what Phil Spencer earns at Microsoft. But Nintendo charge too much, especially for older games! Maybe that is true, but they pay their staff quite well and have really high retention rates, they also seem to reinvest what they earn from their popular titles in more niche titles, so maybe the latest release of Super Mario Galaxy will pay fro a new Famicom Detective Club, Another Code or Advance Wars. I also don't think that Gameshare is a feature that screams greed. Nintendo are getting a lot of stick at the moment, and they do make some wrong headed decisions at times, but as far as massive corporations go, they seem ok. We've all gotten used to low prices in gaming, but low prices, high development costs and a fandom that is often reluctant to compromise on quality, is not a recipe for a sustainable industry.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Mcleod</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree that Nintendo, <em>generally</em>, seems to focus on the right things when it comes to experimenting with new ideas, respecting employees, and doing things that other companies wouldn't or couldn't do. That's why we're all here.</p>
<p>It would be great if everything were cheaper, but again, <em>generally</em> Nintendo does a decent job of threading the needle on pricing - although a $50 Kirby amiibo feels like a real ask. Welcome Tour should absolutely have been a pack-in, too, so I get the frustration, especially in this economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, I don't think the company needs us defending it from a little childish name-calling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sweaty"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey there Nintendo Life!<br>
I wanted to shout out a franchise that I think doesn't get enough credit: Just Dance. I feel like Just Dance is often seen as just that one yearly Ubisoft release that nobody bats an eye at. But this year reestablished for me what a powerhouse it is for social and energetic fun.</p>
<p>This feeling came to me at Comic Con. There was a huge Just Dance setup and it was constantly packed with people. Joining these crowds for the first time was an experience. There's nothing quite like being in cosplay, standing in a crowd of other con-goers and cosplayers, and jumping around to Boney M.'s Rasputin or teaming up with a stranger for Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. No other game there generated the kind of loud and mass fun that Just Dance did, and that's an achievement.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Its appeal is nearly universal. I've enjoyed the game with all kinds of people and in all kinds of places, including in gamer spaces. There's this lovely gaming space I frequent, stacked with consoles and games, so we can play just about anything we want there. Yet a bit ago I booted up Just Dance, and it was a smash hit. We had a blast waving our arms and stepping around the room, with wide grins and loud cries of energetic joy. (Also, shoutout to the accessibility filter and accessible dance routines, so people that can't stand or jump could also join in.)</p>
<p>And speaking of moving around, that's another thing I have to praise Just Dance for. I don't exercise nearly enough: I find it very hard to push myself to do so and I feel deeply uncomfortable and unsafe at gyms. But Just Dance is fun, motivating and accessible enough for me to get up and move with it at least every couple of days. With Just Dance+ there's more than enough songs to keep things fresh, and trying to learn the difficult expert routines to songs like Dua Lipa's Houdini or Britney Spears's Circus and Toxic is genuinely a really fun challenge. I'm not going to act like it's a substitute for proper exercise, but it's a heck of a lot better than nothing and I guarantee you that some of these routines will get you sweaty. You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying, I'd love to see it.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Just Dance is a high quality game with lovely visuals, fun and varied choreo's, and appeal everyone including many hardcore gamers. I know it's not for everyone, nothing is, but in so many groups it's been a guaranteed good time for many years, and it deserves more credit for that. Love you Just Dance!<br>
<strong>Zander</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, it suffers from being the known-est of quantities in 2025, but Just Dance is decent and I've had fun with it over the years.</p>
<p>Honestly<em>,</em> "<em>You try doing Rasputin or Lady Gaga's Judas without your breathing intensifying</em>" is prime bonus letter material, Zander. But we're staunch Boney M defenders in this household, and I wouldn't be able to embed this video in the bonus section. Wunderbar. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"throw my hat"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all this talk about animal crossing I've seen a lot of debates about whether new leaf or new horizons is the best. I'd figured I would throw my hat in the ring. I grew up playing new leaf so I have a very strong emotional attachment to that game. I think neither is better than the other. When I play new horizons there are things I wish it had that new leaf, and when I play new leaf there are things I wish it had that new horizons had. For those at the NL towers who have played both what do y'all think?<br>
<strong>beltmenot</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wild World was my first, so the impact of anything afterwards is lessened - in my brain, WW is still peak. New Leaf and New Horizons are pretty much on a par. For all the improvements, NH has gotten unwieldy with items accessible in too many different places for my taste, and more to come in the January update. And I'd give anything for an icon that shows if you already own an item on sale in Nook's Cranny!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/11/poll-so-animal-crossing-new-leaf-or-new-horizons-which-do-you-like-best">We have discussed this before</a>, and most of the team are off on their hols now, but let me see who I can find ransacking the office fridge for party leftovers... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>"NL is way better. Too much crafting in NH, it felt like a chore – NL was honed to near perfection." - <em>Ollie</em></li>
<li>"NL - <em>love</em> NH, but the fiddly island customisation, the more homogenous villager personalities, and the huge focus on decorating gets away from what I adored in NL. NL felt a lot more compact and impactful to me." <em>- Alana</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>"nothing substantial"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendo Life,<br>
been a while since I joined Your community.<br>
last time i wrote a fan letter i was a kid and wrote to power and games, an italian vg magazine, asking for SFII advice on how to beat m. bison at hard level.<br>
no reply.<br>
I'm 43 and I am writing to you now with nothing substantial to say except for congrats on your hard work.<br>
greetings from Genova, Italy.<br>
<strong>Skoffo</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, thank you very much, Skoffo! Greetings to you from the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>I'll get back to you with the Bison tips. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"in lieu"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a Splatoon fan, and I know there are others hiding around here somewhere, so in lieu of any news whatsoever at all about Splatoon Raiders or an 11.0.0 update for Splatoon 3, I am here with a list of tiny paint-based games to suggest. Or rather, a tiny list of tiny games, because this genre is not huge, apparently.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ink">INK</a> - This is legit my favorite platformer! It's got a such a fun gimmick, good difficulty, and is super satisfying to speedrun! I have nothing more to say, just go buy it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatterbot">Splatterbot</a> - This is essentially a Mario Party minigame, yes, but it's super fun! If you've got kids, or nieces, or nephews, or other little ones in your life, this is a good time! (Plus it's being updated regularly, so if you ever have suggestions... send 'em in to Hey! Kookaburra and he'll probably implement them.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> - It's on NSO, and like... 67% of you probably have this, so give it a whirl!</p>
<p>OK, thank you for reading my tiny list of tiny games with ink-based aspects. Have a nice day, and stay fresh!<strong><br>
CaleBoi25</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have NSO, I know a man who's got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuQZVtzdIo">a few copies of Mario Paint</a>. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"There could be a Pokémon game collection with Gen 1, 2 and 3 with remakes included." - <strong>Your fan, Scottdevine48</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine how much greedy Nintendo would charge for that? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Hello NintendoLife,<br>
Could you please publish PSA articles about NSO game trials? Not everyone is always online and they are easy to miss." - <strong><em>Morsel</em></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a rolling guide might be best. I'll see what we can do. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I got an NSO N64 controller and realised that it can be used to play Mario Kart 8. Do you know what other non-Nintendo Classics games it works with?" - <strong>OswaldTheLuckyGamer</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that doesn't require a second stick? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I just want to say, I love nearly all of you." - <strong>Ed.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sus. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

              <p>Looking for a new pair of headphones tha sound great but won’t cost an entire paycheck? You might not believe it, but you can get a pair of Beats Studio Pro headphones for a fantastic price. And they sound great, too.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro are exactly what you’re looking for, and they’re more than affordable. Y<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">ou can get them at Amazon for $179.95, which is a $170.05 (49%) discount from their original price of $349.95</a>. If you ask us, that’s a significant price cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones with booming bass and crisp treble in a slick package</h2>
<p>This model is perfect for anyone looking to be fully immersed in whatever they’re doing (listening to music, podcasts, etc.). Their ear cups are well-cushioned and extremely comfortable, so you can wear them for extended periods of time without them starting to hurt. The adjustable headband lets you customize the headphones’ fit, so you can tighten them or loosen them as you see fit.</p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro excel when it comes to delivering quality audio, and that’s what you’re here for, right? These headphones are able to produce precise and detailed sound no matter what type of music you like to listen to. The bass is deep and full but doesn’t overpower the midrange and treble. Plus, the vocal clarity is crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Another feature of the Beats Studio Pro is the active noise cancellation that helps eliminate ambient noise so you can focus on your audio without distractions. No matter where you may be (on a crowded train, in a busy office, etc.) the ANC feature can make a serious difference. In addition to blocking out distractions, the Studio Pro headphones also have a feature called “Transparency Mode” that lets you allow outside noises in so you can hear what’s going on even when wearing the headphones.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, the Beats Studio Pro can give you several hours of playback time on a single charge. In addition to the battery life, the carrying case of the headphones is capable of getting you back up to speed quickly so you are ready to go again. Fast charging is supported by the headphones so you can obtain a meaningful boost to the battery in a short period of time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5994/">All in all, the Beats Studio Pro are a combination of powerful sound, comfort and intelligent features in a product that not only looks great but also performs exceptionally well.</a> And you’re not going to find a better deal for some time, being that we’ve reached the end of the holiday gifting season. That means you should snap yours up while you still can.</p>

              <p>I feel like a broken record, but once again, in many ways this was a bad year for developers, gamers, and the industry writ large. But hey, just because AI slop is ruining everything and greedy execs are destroying pop culture, that doesn’t mean we can’t find some joy and genuinely great moments in all the bullshit.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-surprises-games-trailers-video-game-moments-2024-1851725768">Like we’ve</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">done in years past</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-news-announcements-surprises-2022-1849899925">here</a> we’ve collected 10 of the best video game surprises and bits of good news from the past year. Hold on to them tightly. Cherish them. Reread this list a few times. Remember that things can be good. Hope is important. We’ll likely need a lot of it to get through 2026.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> Rules</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001641" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001641"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001641">©FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The average person seems pretty burnt out on live-service multiplayer games. Fans had every reason to respond with groans and sighs to the idea of the premier action-RPG maker turning its attention and resources to exactly that<!--StartFragment --><span>—<a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335">an online multiplayer game</a><!--StartFragment -->—</span>instead of toward its next single-player adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But FromSoftware delivered with</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-wandering-mausoleum-meteor-1851784652"><i><span>Elden Ring Nightreign</span></i></a><span>. It didn’t just successfully nail multiplayer <em>Elden Ring;</em> it produced an entire new mash-up of genres that I wish more games would try to experiment with. Do you need close friends to get maximum enjoyment? Sure. But unlike some of the friendslop turning heads out there this year, <em>Nightreign</em>‘s magic goes far beyond capturing hot mics and silly moments. (It’s great for that too, though.) I now expect great things from<em> The Duskbloods</em> and would love to see FromSoftware reimagine </span><i><span>Armored Core</span></i><span> PVE for the modern era. -Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Star Wars: Fate of The Old Republic</em> Announced</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653099" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653099"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653099">©Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p>The 2025 Game Awards started off with a super-surprising announcement: <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076"><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></a>. This is a new single-player RPG from <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>and <em>Mass Effect</em> director Casey Hudson, and is a spiritual successor to <em>KOTOR</em>. Holy shit, folks! Sure, it ain’t <em>KOTOR 3,</em> but it’s likely the closest we’ll ever get to that game, and that alone has fans excited.</p>

 <p>Before you start getting <em>too</em> hyped to play <em>Fate of the Old Republic,</em> it should be noted that the studio working on <em>FOTOR</em> was formed just a few months ago, so this game is likely five or more years away from release and could launch on PlayStation 6 or even PS7.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-fotor-2030-casey-hudson-rpg-rumor-2000653419">Hudson denies this, however,</a> and claims it will be out before 2030. I want to believe him, but I’m not sold on that being possible unless <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is much smaller in scope than most AAA RPGs. We’ll just have to wait and see, and hope this one doesn’t get canceled.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Digital Foundry</em> And <em>Giant Bomb</em> Going Fully Independent&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002971" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002971"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002971">©Giant Bomb</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The digital games media space has never been more pervasive, thanks to creator platforms like TikTok and YouTube, but it’s also never been less able to support large institutional teams producing work that wouldn’t otherwise flourish on our algorithmically driven internet. </span><span>So it was heartening to see that despite the broader digital media apocalypse, there’s still room for once corporate-owned outlets to thrive in the indie space. <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">That includes the re-launch of <em>Giant Bomb</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a>, as well as things like <em>Game Informer</em> coming back to life with a physical magazine that you can actually buy IRL.&nbsp; – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong>Nintendo Adds Virtual Boy Emulation To The Switch Online Catalog</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000227927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000227927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000227927">©Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>There aren’t many people around who fondly remember Nintendo’s failed stereoscopic 3D Virtual Boy console from 1995. It was a big flop for the company, was barely supported by it or third-party studios, and has mostly faded into the past as an odd misfire from the Mario maker.</p> <p>But it is still a part of video game history, and so it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/virtual-boy-nintendo-switch-classics-2000625301">extremely unexpected but nice to see</a> Nintendo announce Virtual Boy games coming to Nintendo Switch Online. And to let you play these rudimentary 3D games properly, Nintendo is shipping a whole new headset accessory that looks a lot like the OG Virtual Boy. All of this arrives in February 2026.</p> <h2><strong><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em> Was Worth The Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653434" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653434"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653434">©Reef Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>Back in February,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</i>was announced with&nbsp;<u data-stringify-type="underline"><a href="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://youtu.be/hfj6FBLZxsg?si=Vzwt9zCUnmlRgpKj" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a reveal trailer</a></u>&nbsp;that immediately propelled the game to the top of my most wanted list. With its beautiful pixel art and excellent animation,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate</i>&nbsp;looked like it might finally deliver the pulse-pounding run-and-gun action game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, but never received.

But you never know for sure until a game arrives, so as hopeful as I was, I also feared that the end result might be a disappointing one.</p>

 <p>Originally set for release in September,&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">No Fate&nbsp;</i>saw delay after delay, pushing it back to December 12 and making me more anxious than ever. <a href="https://kotaku.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-review-steam-switch-ps5-2000653418">But the end result proved to be everything I hoped it could be</a>: a gorgeous, varied, challenging, and immensely rewarding action game that not only does the film justice, but earns a place among the best arcade-style action games of all time. What a wonderful surprise to help close out the year! – Carolyn Petit</p> <h2><strong><em>Helldivers 2</em> Comes To Xbox,<em> Gears Of War</em> Goes To PlayStation</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000318" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000318"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000318">©PlayStation Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>The era of video game exclusives has truly come to an end. I mean, we all sort of knew that already, but in 2025, we watched it happen in real-time in a way that I’ve never seen before. On August 26,<a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106"> <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em></a>, a remaster of a remake of the first game in the once Xbox-only series, arrived on PlayStation 5. On the very same day, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">PlayStation published <em>Helldivers 2</em> launched on Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>. It was like watching a prisoner exchange on a bridge between two nations that were once at war, but who now have struck a truce.</p>

 <p>And yeah,<a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-remastered-reloaded-running-ps5-xbox-weird-2000620092"> playing <em>Gears of War</em> on a PlayStation is strange</a>! I earned Xbox achievements on a PS5. We live in weird times. But I’m also happy that the future seems to be one in which you won’t need to own every console to play every game. That’s nice, and as consoles get more expensive, it will be a boon for gamers trying to enjoy the hobby on a limited budget.</p> <h2><strong>Id Software, Bethesda, and Ubisoft Studios In North America Unionize!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001754" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001754"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001754">©Bethesda / id Software</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Despite the bottom falling out of the AAA video game industry this year, gaming’s nascent labor movement has continued to eke out notable victories. <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003">Multiple teams at Blizzard</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">announced new wall-to-wall unions</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-id-software-union-microsoft-xbox-cwa-2000653008">while developers at Bethesda</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">secured their first contract.</a> And the organizing isn’t just isolated to Microsoft-owned studios in the U.S.,<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"> Ubisoft Halifax in Canada just formed a union as well</a>. – Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite’s</em> Mini-<em>Simpson</em>s Season Was Great, Actually!&nbsp;</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640880">©Epic</figcaption></figure> <p>A mini <em>Fortnite</em> season based entirely on<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em> The Simpsons</em></a> could have been a disaster. But despite the odds, Epic was able to make it work and delivered what might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">my favorite season of <em>Fortnite</em> in a long time</a>. The Springfield island map was incredible to explore. The visuals felt very cartoonish and <em>Simpsons</em>-y without looking too garish, and all the <em>Simpsons</em> Easter eggs and characters that appeared throughout the event were a treat for fans. And on top of all that, this season included funny animated segments featuring <em>Simpsons</em> characters that were written by the staff of the show. Is this just one more sign of all of pop culture merging together into a grey slurry? Sure. But whatever, man, I can now play as Moe in <em>Fortnite</em>. I’m happy.</p>

And hey, <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> ended up being a solid and very pretty way to play (or replay) Bethesda’s seminal open-world RPG. Now, let’s hope next year’s list of best surprises features an entry about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>remaster shadow-dropping out of nowhere.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> Finally Launches After A Long Wait</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000619153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619153">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a><span> could have easily been delayed out of 2025 or been disappointingly mid when it launched.

It offers faster shipping, as well as access to member-only discounts that can help you save in the long run.

You will be able to work on a bunch of projects at the same time, use different applications simultaneously, hop between a ton of tabs, take back-to-back meetings, and more – all without slowing down one bit. Even better, the memory can be expanded up to 64GB as needed. Storage capacity is just as exceptional. You’re getting a built-in 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD, which offers enough space to house all your important documents, research stuff, media content, etc, in a single place. Like memory, storage, too, is expandable up to 4TB. You can always add more as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>

It’s capable of moving a 3GB 4K video in just one second – something creatives dealing with large projects are going to appreciate. Triple display output is also supported for those looking to create a bigger, more productive work setup. But despite this, the PC stays calm and cool while working. That’s thanks to its advanced dual fan cooling that ensures optimal performance even during resource-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, so you’ve got a system that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Best Fortnite Christmas Skins of All Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-fortnite-christmas-skins/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to shine year after year, and Christmas is a time when a flurry of festive skins are made available, and the vast quantity of them makes it difficult to rank the very best.</p>



<p>With the annual Winterfest celebration, Fortnite adds new Christmas-themed skins every year, featuring entirely new creations or established characters with a festive spin.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has run the rule over all of the Christmas skins introduced to Fortnite over the years to issue a verdict on the best ever released.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-fortnite-christmas-skins">Best Fortnite Christmas Skins</h2>



<h3 id="h-crackshot">Crackshot</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Terrifying. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially introduced on Christmas Eve in 2017, Crackshot is a terrifying nutcracker that makes regular appearances in the Fortnite Item Shop, and stands out as one of the best festive-themed skins in Fortnite.</p>



<p>With five Selectable Styles, Crackshot is certainly worth the 2,000 V-Bucks it costs to purchase, and it will take some doing for the skin not to be considered among Christmas’ best.</p>



<h3 id="h-grimbles">Grimbles</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Gnome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Grimbles was first introduced to Fortnite in Dedcember 2018, making repeated appearances since then, and, while he has a much more approachable look compared to some of the other Outfits on this list, it’s certainly not one to mess with.</p>



<p>Grimbles has a Selectable Style that includes red, glowing eyes, transforming the friendly gnome into a rather haunting nightmare.</p>



<h3 id="h-krampus">Krampus</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ho ho horror. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another iconic Christmas skin in Fortnite that first appeared in 2018, Krampus is an Outfit that splits opinion in the Fortnite community, but there’s no doubting it boasts an iconic look.</p>



<p>Anti-Claus is inspired by European folklore, said to be a half-goat, half-demon figure who acts as the opposite to Santa Claus, punishing those who misbehave, so play nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-sgt-winter">Sgt. Winter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Naughty or nice. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Battle Pass skin all the way back in Season 7 in 2018, Sgt. Winter shows what Santa would look like if he were to have chosen a different lifestyle and brought the pain rather than spreading Christmas cheer.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Sgt. Winter came in the Battle Pass before Fortnite removed the exclusivity restrictions, so the original Sgt. Winter won’t be available again.</p>



<h3 id="h-dolph">Dolph</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hooves and all. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Introduced in 2019 on Christmas Eve, Dolph is a bipedal, almost humanoid version of Santa’s favorite reindeer, though points have to be docked due to the lack of a shiny red nose.</p>



<p>Still, Dolph is a classic Christmas skin in Fortnite and provides a stellar look while you sleigh your enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-polar-patroller">Polar Patroller</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Beary good. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Polar Patroller was initially introduced on New Year’s Eve in 2019 and has regularly returned to the Item Shop, including a styint available in November this year, and pairs well with the Dolph skin as both show animals transformed into Fortnite characters.</p>



<p>He doesn’t look as imposing without the grenade launcher he carries in promotional art, however, but you still shouldn’t cuddle this bear.</p>



<h3 id="h-sled-ready-guff">Sled Ready Guff</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Unbeatable. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Guff is a fan-favorite character introduced in Fortnite and the Sled Ready skin is arguably the best of them all, with the reindeer attire certainly looking better than the Santa approach in Guff Gringle, where it looks like he’s suffered a bit of sunburn.</p>



<p>Sled Ready Guff was initially available in Chapter 4, Season 1 in December 2022 through completing challenges, and has not been obtainable since. </p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-bushranger">Winterfest Bushranger</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Winter is coming. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Christmas twist to the traditional Bushranger Outfit, Winterfest Bushranger comes equipped with a Christmas tree design, a Santa hat, and plenty of decorations.</p>



<p>Winterfest Bushranger was released in December 2023, obtainable through challenges, and may feature in the Item Shop in future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Feature: I Play This One Particular SNES Game Every Xmas As A Personal Tradition]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-play-this-one-particular-snes-game-every-xmas-as-a-personal-tradition</link>
            <guid>1392067</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It was the Christmas of 1992. <a href="https://youtu.be/svcznf9cxtY?si=XFI81dUw7IU_LgNC">Mr Blobby</a> was the funniest thing on television (according to your parents), and <a href="https://youtu.be/3JWTaaS7LdU?si=X88fExf5WKFM4q0D">Whitney Houston</a> had been tricked into singing a love song about everyone's favourite sentient cardigan, Kevin Costner (I feel like I'm having a war flashback now).</p>
<p>And me? Well, I was having a great time despite all of this, actually. Because Santa had done me a massive solid.</p>
<p>Now, two things. Firstly, Santa hadn't done a toilet in my lounge. That's not what I mean at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, I was 14 years old in 1992, so I shouldn't have been asking my bewildered and frightened parents (Mr Blobby-loving fools) to send a rather bullish letter to the North Pole requesting — demanding — a Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>
<p>With the arrival of this tour-de-force into to the sitting room of my Dickensian home on 25th December 1992, I, for the first time ever, was experiencing graphical and gameplay parity (<a href="https://youtu.be/BiufDI8cBkU?si=8WK4Z9utZUC-3ee2">after a lot of trying on my beloved Commodore 64</a>) with the local arcade version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">The World Warrior</a>, where I had previously been spending all the money I could steal from my Mr Blobby-loving dad to feed my addiction to Eddie Honda's big shiny chest. (Don't worry, I never paid him back.)</p>

<p>This was my first Nintendo console! My first console of any kind that was mine, in fact, and as a result of this, and because it was the first game that really made me feel as though the home experience could indeed match the flashy side of the arcade one, Street Fighter 2 has — and always will have — a very special place in my heart. It was a bonus, really, that it was also phenomenal to play as well as to sit and stare at.</p>
<p>In a way that it's hard to convey today, when we're drowning in deep and meaningful gaming experiences, and when gamers have grown up with home consoles that give them the best of everything at their fingertips, Street Fighter 2 awakened me to the possibility that, for me, gaming might not, like a puppy for example, be just for Christmas.</p>
<p>And this is the serious bit, the 'science bit' if you will. Because I grew up in a time and place that happened entirely before the internet (and possibly before Jesus, but that's another Christmas story for another Christmastime), it was very easy to feel cut off and left behind in matters technologic. Such was life in rural '80s and '90s Ireland; lots of cow s**t, not so much of the latest high street cool s**t.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3cc5bfd3621c5"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3cc5bfd3621c5/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Street Fighter 2, though, with those fancy arcade-perfect graphics and noises and music, well, that was what everyone who knew anything was playing and talking about that particular year's end (in my young mind), and I was now playing and talking about it, too. Mostly to myself, but you can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>It seems like nothing, and it is! But that little glimmer of feeling as though I was involved was, for a wee guy who was yet to meet any other real-world gaming pals, and for someone who lived quite remotely, it was a big deal to be riding the latest wave of excitement. You couldn't just hit someone up in their DMs back then, y'know. Connections hit different.</p>
<p>And so, because I'm a legit saddo (as you'll now know and understand), every Christmas <em>to this very day</em> I still boot up the old Street Fighter 2 on my SNES (not my OG machine, unfortunately) and dig into one or two runs of its fabulous arcade mode. It's a game that's never aged in my mind; it looks as good as it ever did in its detailed pugilists, atmospheric environments and delightful little background animations. And complaints about the awful frame rate will get you banned from my Xmas party punch bowl, I'm afraid.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fcb98f3984af0"><a title="Street Fighter 2 SNES" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fcb98f3984af0/street-fighter-2-snes.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It ties a bow on my festive period, it drowns me in just right volume of intoxicating nostalgia, and it reminds me of more innocent times. All of that guff.</p>
<p>But it also marks a point where I remember vividly having shifted from loving games and playing games for what they were to wanting to keep them in my life as a thing that helped me connect and feel connected. And I guess that's what I'm still doing to this day.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to show my sons how red and trembly my face goes when I can't reliably pull off Vega's wall dive. Merry Christmas and that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, the gaming space went into a downward spiral as several major titles went offline. In a global network issue, the likes of Fortnite, ARC Raiders, Steam, Rocket League, and Marvel Rivals suffered, and of course, gamers took to social media to vent their frustrations.</p>



<p>In a quickshot post on socials, Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, lamented the issues with an apologetic message of sorts.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-servers-are-melting-down">The Servers Are Melting Down</h2>



<p>Fortnite was one of the most heavily impacted games in the recent server outage issue that knocked multiple games offline. The blip took down countless top-tier titles, leaving players stranded on Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2004019861807374671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post</a> acknowledging the issues, Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic Games, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The servers are melting down, sorry fam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed that up three hours later with a much more encouraging comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s back, and Merry Christmas everyone!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The simple message was a nice note to indicate that even the top-most individual at Epic Games has his finger on the pulse, even at the height of the festive break.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been documented what caused the issue, but given the widespread nature of the blip, it’s safe to assume it was related to the global network infrastructure that seems to be so shaky these days. The issues impacted a diverse array of titles, and this is a problem that’s becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly this year.</p>



<p>As the world becomes increasingly reliant on networking and the likes of AI, connected living, and cloud computing become much more important, we’re going to see these problems surface much more often.</p>



<p>Which is a shame, given that gaming is almost inherently dependent on good internet these days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-25-928/</link>
            <guid>1392046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s finally here! It’s the ultimate festive day of the year, but before you start tearing open your gifts and scoffing down a Christmas lunch, you need to complete one of the final NYT Connections puzzles of 2025. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can complete the puzzle as quickly as possible, keep your streak going, and get back to the festivities.</p>



<p>Read on for today’s NYT Connections answers!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-25">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 25)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #928:</p>



<ul>
<li>EXCESSIVE</li>



<li>COIN</li>



<li>FLOWERY</li>



<li>FASHION</li>



<li>MELODRAMATIC</li>



<li>HATCH</li>



<li>PURPLE</li>



<li>MAKE UP</li>



<li>CHERRY</li>



<li>LAREDO</li>



<li>FLOWER</li>



<li>MIRE</li>



<li>MUSICAL NOTE</li>



<li>RETIRE</li>



<li>WINE GLASS</li>



<li>SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Why be plain when you can go over-the-top?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Be inventive with this group</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Hopefully the answer <strong>stems </strong>from this hint</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think singing scales and warming up your voice</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 25:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-december-25-928">NYT Connections Answers for Today, December 25 (#928)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– EXCESSIVE, FLOWERY, MELODRAMATIC, PURPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – COIN, FASHION, HATCH, MAKE UP</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CHERRY, FLOWER, MUSICAL NOTE, WINE GLASS</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – LAREDO, MIRE, RETIRE, SOLTI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Wants You To Play Fallout 5 For ‘600 Hours’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/</link>
            <guid>1392037</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone knows that Fallout games are designed to be played for a <strong>very long time</strong>. In the case of Fallout 76, the last major release in the post-apocalyptic series, there’s an infinite number of hours waiting to be explored. In a recent interview, the team at Bethesda Game Studios revealed that these concepts are being built into Fallout 5.</p>



<p>One of the lead developers working on Fallout’s next major iteration revealed that the goal is <strong>600 hours</strong>, in an ideal world. It’s not the kind of game that can be played for just ’20 hours’, but players are going to be given enough meat on the irradiated bones to play for an extremely long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-we-expect-from-fallout-5">What We Expect from Fallout 5</h2>



<p>Being honest, we expected nothing less from Fallout 5. With each new release in the series, Fallout has gotten increasingly expansive and ambitious. Fallout 76 (2018) is a live-service MMORPG that has never stopped evolving, so it stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be similarly impressive.</p>



<p>While we know very little about the game, Bethesda’s Todd Howard did recently confirm that it’ll be tied in with the ongoing television show.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, several members of the Bethesda Game Studios leadership team spoke about the future of the franchise. Emil Pagliarulo, one of the most notable developers on the team and the studio’s design director, dropped a tidbit about Fallout 5’s ideal duration:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would be happy with a game that is as successful as the previous Fallout games that continues to give fans what they love, you know, and to give them a story that they can get into and systems that they love and really just an experience that they play not for 20 hours and not for 100 hours, but an experience they can play for 200, 300, you know, 600 hours, because that’s the kind of games we make. That would be my hope going forward: Keep doing what we’ve done, and also to evolve.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, those are rookie numbers, as Fallout is the kind of series that can keep providing new experiences 1000+ hours into a run. With the implementation of mods, Creation Club content, expansions, and regular updates, Fallout games have been kept alive and kicking for <strong>decades</strong>, in some cases.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 doesn’t have any kind of a release window, but at this rate, and with the ambitions of the studio, we’d expect it to be 2030 before we even have a teaser trailer released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Update Adds Long-Awaited Quality-of-Life Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-update-quality-of-life-feature/</link>
            <guid>1392034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov players are loading into the game after the most recent patch (1.0.1.0) to find a quality-of-life feature that they’ve been needing for years. When you deploy into your next raid, you’ll notice a UI upgrade that includes a progress bar that represents how long it’s going to take for you to load into your session.</p>



<p>This means it’s no longer based entirely around guesswork as to how long it’s going to take to load into your game. The progress bar shows you exactly where you’re at in the queue, how long the estimated load time is, and how long you’ve already been waiting (which isn’t new, of course).</p>



<h2 id="h-small-tarkov-change-big-impact">Small Tarkov Change, Big Impact</h2>



<p>For the longest time, fans of the pioneering extraction shooter that is Escape from Tarkov have been left wanting when it comes to loading into raids. In the worst cases, it can take double-digit minutes before you get into your raid, and you’re left to sit there and let the clock run up.</p>



<p>This latest update, introduced with the 1.0.1.0 patch that also brought about the winter event, ensures that players have a UI upgrade that fixes that to some extent.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: AirwingMarine on X</figcaption></figure>







<p>It doesn’t address long load times – that comes later. Instead, it gives players a mostly accurate representation of how long it’s expected to take for them to get into their raid. This means that players no longer need to sit in their queue ad infinitum. If they see there’s an estimated load time of 10 minutes, they can just back out and try again.</p>



<p>It <strong>has </strong>been reported by players on socials that it’s not entirely accurate right now. One user wrote that their estimated deploy time was over six minutes, and they were in their raid in three.</p>



<p>It’s a minor change for some, but for those who have been playing Escape from Tarkov for a lot longer, it’s a no-brainer addition that is long overdue.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see the UI upgrade in Escape from Tarkov’s latest update? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

		<p>Merry Christmas, everybody!</p>
<p>For all of you gathering together with family and friends, opening presents, gorging yourselves on a bit too much dinner, and all the other trimmings that come with Christmas Day, we hope you have a wonderful time today and through the rest of the holidays that mark the end of the year.</p>

<p>Once again, 2025 has been a years filled with challenges for people all through the country and the world, and we want to take this time to also remember those who are experiencing hardship, hunger, war, or simply fear for what the future can and will bring. With the deep impact of wars continuing to be felt in Ukraine, in Gaza, civil wars in several African countries, and more conflict elsewhere, we can only hope for peace and resolution and an ending to the bloodshed.</p>

<p>If you have spare money please consider giving it to support civilians caught up in these conflicts. <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/">War Child</a> is a charity that specifically focuses on the impact that war has on children.</p>

                <p>I prefer to play my games without mods or console commands to get as close to the intended experience as possible. But sometimes something breaks and you need to reset your character, you have an accessibility need, or maybe you're just 1,000 hours into your game and aren't worried about doing stuff in-engine anymore. That's what console commands are for. Like any big crafting game should, Satisfactory has a variety of console commands available. Continue on for how to use those commands, and what cheats are available.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we dive in, cheating in Satisfactory isn't as simple and straightforward as we might hope. There are a variety of console commands available, but most of them pertain to user preferences. To use actual cheats, you'll have to install a mod.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Console Commands</h3><p dir="ltr">Look at the upper-right corner of your keyboard. You should see a key that has one or more of these characters: ~, `, or §. That last one is pretty standard on a lot of European keyboard layouts. Pressing this will bring up the console.</p><h3 dir="ltr">How to use Cheats</h3><p dir="ltr">We have a full list of Console and Debug commands further down, but we would be remiss in not mentioning our favorite command: Cheats.</p><p dir="ltr">For Cheats to work, you'll need to download and install the <a href="https://ficsit.app/mod/SML" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML)</a>, with additional information in the <a href="https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/SMLChatCommands.html" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory Modding Documentation</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of our favorite Cheats include: NoPower, NoCost, TurboProductionMode, and Teleport. NoPower still requires that you wire up your machines, but you don't have to actually power them. NoCost makes machines and the like free to place. TurboProductionMode turns crafting at the bench into an instantaneous affair. Finally, Teleport puts you wherever you like on the map, which is great for when you manage to get yourself into a precarious position between a big drop and some predators who haven't noticed you just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Below, you'll find listings for all console, debug, and cheat commands, per the Satisfactory Modding Documentation page and the <a href="https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Console" rel="nofollow ">Satisfactory wiki</a> on Fandom.</p><h3 dir="ltr">All Console, Debug, and Cheat commands</h3><p>Console Commands</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>?

You can also use it to give yourself additional inventory slots via GiveItemStacks "" numberOfSlots</td></tr><tr><td>GiveItemsSingle &lt;Blueprint Path&gt; &lt;Number of Items&gt;</td><td>Adds a number of individual items to the player’s inventory.

The boolean argument controls if it should "repopulateEmptyLegs," presumably if they were deleted somehow.</td></tr><tr><td>RebuildFactoryLegsOneTileAroundPlayer</td><td>Recalculates the support legs on buildings near the player. If the gap is too large, they will just reset to zero.</td></tr><tr><td>FillAllFreightCars &lt;percent full, float&gt;</td><td>Fills all freight cars in the map with a nameless, descriptionless placeholder item.

They still have collision.</td></tr><tr><td>ShowFactoryOnly &lt;true/false&gt;</td><td>Hides or shows all terrain, including the skybox and its light. Disables your flashlight when enabled.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> was, coincidentally, one of 2022's <em>sleeper</em> hits.

<p>It will come as no surprise, then, that we were rather excited to see a sequel on the way. Announced in June 2023 and confirmed to be coming to Switch at the June 2024 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/tabletop-inspired-rpg-citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-gets-january-release">PC Gaming Showcase</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper_2_starward_vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a> promises more of the same deep space dilemmas, but with an expanded dice system, clean-cut job roles and multiple environments to explore, we were keen to learn more about its new recruits before liftoff.</p>
<p>Sitting for a chat with Gareth Damian Martin (of the game's one-person team, Jump Over The Age), we aimed to do just that. Our conversation covered an intergalactic range of topics, including the pressure of making a sequel, the game's TTRPG roots and their plans for the future.</p>
<p>So, don your space suits and buckle up, Sleeper, it's time to talk spaaaaace...</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Citizen Sleeper was a huge success back in 2022, but you’ve said in the past that a sequel wasn’t the natural next project for you. What was it that made you want to come back to this universe for Citizen Sleeper 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gareth Damian Martin, Jump Over The Age:</strong> I’m a big fan of making experimental projects, and inventing new designs within games, which means a sequel isn’t always my first instinct. But with Citizen Sleeper, I felt there was still so much more of the experiment to do! The first game was fairly modest in terms of system and scale, so it left plenty of space for new systems and ideas. In particular, I’m a big fan of “ship and crew” sci-fi series like <strong>Cowboy Bebop</strong> and <strong>Farscape,</strong> but I have always felt games never quite got the genre right. So it was exciting to try to make one of these stories within the Citizen Sleeper universe, which I felt was ideally suited to this kind of storytelling.</p>
<p>In the end, I felt like there was an opportunity to build on the first game while also offering something equally fresh and different so that the two games could sit alongside each other as a pair.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2246b1082effe"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2246b1082effe/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2, like its predecessor, is about a lot of different things: capitalism, humanity, survival, loneliness, etc. What are the biggest challenges of balancing so many themes when it comes to writing a story like this?</strong></p>
<p>I have to be honest, I don’t really write “thematically” when I’m telling a story. I’m not really focused on making statements. Instead, I am very interested in my characters and the different paths they can take through the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I start writing, I often have a lot of situations in my mind that feel interesting or exciting. I might have an idea for a contract where you instigate a mutiny on a ship in the middle of a general strike or an idea for a group of characters who are all pursuing the same long-lost interstellar drive. I select and invent these based on my own interests, so the reason Citizen Sleeper has these themes is because that’s what interests me in the world! That’s when I really set up the subjects of the story, and from that point on, my mind is focused on who the characters are, how they speak, how the world works, and what might make for a compelling plot.</p>
<p>Some stories are compelling because they are tense and pacy, others because they are introspective and heartfelt. For me, the beauty of Citizen Sleeper is that the game can contain all these atmospheres and stories at once, so I don’t worry too much about balancing. If it interests me and seems like a strong story, I try to get it in!</p>
<p><strong>Despite sharing some narrative DNA, this sequel feels like it can be played by those unfamiliar with the first entry. How important was it for you to create something that continues the Citizen Sleeper universe, but also works as a standalone?</strong></p>
<p>I think this is always an important part of making a sequel, you have to assume that this is the first game for players. But rather than see this as a limit, I saw it as an opportunity. I have always been a big fan of time skips in stories. When done well, they mix all the existing ingredients of the story, and then the reader or player gets to feel smart and curious as they piece it all back together and tell their own story of what happened in the missing time between.</p>
<p>What is especially fun with a time skip is they often allow for the prequel/sequel order to be read in either way, as discovering where a character came from is as compelling as discovering where they end up. So this was a big focus when making the game, and I really hope players enjoy connecting the dots between the two games and being surprised by the often unusual journeys characters may take.</p>

<p><strong>The sequel appears to be much more rooted in the RPG genre, with clearly defined class skills, missions and expanded dice mechanics as just a few additions. Were there any other games (video or tabletop) that inspired these mechanics during development?</strong></p>
<p>As with the first game, Citizen Sleeper 2 was massively inspired by designs and concepts from pen-and-paper TTRPGs. <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/greetings-scoundrel">Blades in the Dark</a> was the first tabletop game I ever ran, and it remains my favourite. It inspired the first game, and with the sequel, I saw the opportunity to adapt more of its systems into a video game. Citizen Sleeper 2’s “push” mechanic, where you accrue stress to gain a bonus to or reroll your dice, is a direct inspiration from that game, and its systems are designed around asking the player to “push their luck”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the stress systems I added to Citizen Sleeper 2, I took inspiration from the myriad of stress systems appearing in tabletop games over the past five years, but especially <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gerdling/mothership-sci-fi-horror-rpg-1st-edition-boxed-set">Mothership</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart:_The_City_Beneath">Heart: The City Beneath</a>. There’s so much good and exciting game design happening in the tabletop scene, and I find it a constant inspiration for my own work.</p>
<p>On the video game side, my main touchstone was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/mass_effect_2">Mass Effect 2</a>. I wouldn’t say I was attempting to replicate anything from Mass Effect 2, however, more that I wanted to make a game that approached similar ideas in a different way. I often find this is a way I like to work in games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/in_other_waters">In Other Waters</a> was my own take on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, refocusing it on scanning and xenobiology. In the same way, Citizen Sleeper is my own take on the <strong>Mass Effect</strong> series, shifting the focus from saving the galaxy as a supercop to learning to live and survive in the margins of an interstellar society.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8285810a21037"><a title="Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8285810a21037/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Fellow Traveller</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>With community and home being such an important part of the first game, how does this theme play into the larger setting of the Starward Belt in the sequel, and what challenges do the new hubs pose for the Sleeper?</strong></p>
<p>Ideas of home play out a little differently in Citizen Sleeper 2: rather than having a massive urban megastructure as the location, the game plays out over a series of scattered habitats of varying size and style. Because of this, your home really becomes the Rig, a ship you have stolen and that expands and changes over the course of the game. I really want to capture that slow and subtle process of transformation as the ship gains crew and becomes more familiar, and often in writing the game, I found that to be in contrast with the Hubs, which ultimately, you always have to leave.</p>
<p>So I think at the heart of the game is a tension between moving on and settling down, which feels very important to the Citizen Sleeper series in general.</p>
<p><strong>There were many stressful moments in Citizen Sleeper, and now Stress is a mechanic in the sequel. Why did you decide to implement this, and what effect will it have on your relationships in-game?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely, while also opening up the possibility of more stories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stress systems are a fairly popular and well-battle-tested element in many contemporary TTRPGs, and I think that’s because they offer an abstract form of harm vs Health Points. You might take stress from a heist, a difficult negotiation, or babysitting a child, but you hopefully wouldn’t take HP damage! This allows for a broader range of challenges for players and also consequences. I was really aware of the possibilities this opened up for telling a broader range of stories from running TTRPGs, especially ones that aren’t focused on combat. So this was one of the first things I wanted to add to the sequel.</p>
<p>As I developed these ideas in Citizen Sleeper 2, stress quickly became a very useful tool to represent all kinds of systems in the game. It represents the stress your body is under and the possibility that the pressure might turn into real and permanent harm. It represents your crew’s eagerness to continue working on a contract when things don’t go well. It also represents more abstract ideas, like how quickly a derelict ship is falling apart, or the opinions of a disgruntled crew turning against their captain. So stress bars of various kinds will have a huge effect on your path through Citizen Sleeper 2, and I think managing them is one of the most compelling and tense parts of the game.</p>
<p>This time around, I really wanted the game to be stressful, compelling and filled with emergent stories of success and failure. Stress is the tool that allows me to achieve that.</p>

<p><strong>You recently told</strong> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-will-be-the-last-citizen-sleeper-video-game"><strong>Eurogamer</strong></a> <strong>that Citizen Sleeper 2 would be the last video game in the Citizen Sleeper universe, but a tabletop adaptation is still on the cards for the future. How does it feel to be thinking about returning the game to its tabletop roots and is there anything you feel will be lost/gained in the process?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very early in the process of making a Citizen Sleeper TTRPG (as you might imagine, I’ve been busy with the sequel!), but I have a very clear objective with it. I’m really happy with the two games and the story they tell in this universe. I think Citizen Sleeper 2 ties up some of the ideas nicely while also opening up the possibility of more stories. My aim with the TTRPG is to hand the tools to tell those stories over to the player and to let them carry whichever threads catch their interest forward with their friends (or start totally new ones).</p>
<p>What gets left behind by doing that is, of course, my own presence as the narrator of those stories, but I think after two games, there are a lot of references for people to go to if that’s what they want. What is gained is the radical openness of a tabletop system, the chance for players to fill in the gaps in a meaningful way and really explore their connections to the universe’s characters and ideas. Which, in a way, is what these games have been about all along.</p>

                <p>Video game soundtracks often don't stand out unless they're tied to meaningful or memorable points that create a lasting emotional impact, evoking anything from joy or sadness to pure hype or awe. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/south-of-midnight/" data-ref-id="5000-590939">South of Midnight</a> by Compulsion Games manages to intertwine its narrative with its music and audio design in such a way that those unforgettable moments are numerous throughout its 10-12 hour storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight takes place in a fantasy version of the American Deep South, and it's full of characters and creatures who have lived through tragic events. You play as Hazel--a Weaver who can see ghosts and learn from the past through memories. Hazel helps address and heal others' emotional wounds through a bit of magic and a lot of understanding. As the details behind characters' hardships unfold, their trauma transforms into pieces of music that reinforce the game's themes and live on long after the credits roll.</p><p dir="ltr">I spoke to

I brought this up when speaking to them, trying to understand how the game sounds the way it does despite that fact. Derivière shared a similar confusion when he was first asked to work on the project.</p><p dir="ltr">"At first, I was like, 'Why are you hiring me? I'm French.' I'm not from the South. This is not my culture," Derivière shared. "And they were like, 'We know that. We know that, but we don't want you to be accurate. We want you to be authentic.' And so when they said this, I was like, 'Oh, I understand.' You don't want to create something that is from the South--like, accurately from the South--because it's a fantasy. But it's inspired by the South."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière and Fox are both European, but creative director David Sears is from the South, and the same goes for many of the musicians and vocalists featured in South of Midnight's music. Derivière explains this point, saying Compulsion didn't want him to "mimic" anything, but create something authentic in their fantasy world.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've worked with amazing musicians from Nashville, some Americans in Paris, [and] of course, London, for the orchestra," Derivière said. "I would come with my version of the song... And this is where authenticity came in, because they're from there, you know, either New Orleans, [or] Nashville, wherever. And they look at the charts, they look at the melody, and they're like, 'Alright!' And they start playing, and boom! It's culture. It's art."</p><p dir="ltr">He spoke a bit more about the culture involved, saying, "We are in a sort of blend of cultures--African cultures, European cultures. And this is the good part [about] this music. It created a cultural background for America, but it comes from everywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">Fox mentioned that he even had a playlist of music from the Deep South for Derivière to listen to, but decided against sharing it to allow for more creativity.</p><p dir="ltr">"My job is to create an environment where he can be the most creative and have the most freedom to make something original that would stand out. So I didn't give him that playlist because of that," Fox explained. "But if you say, 'I want something like this.' You're going to get a carbon copy of that thing. So, you know, Coke becomes like Coke Light. You have to be happy to possibly fail in the process--it's a risk. But I thought, with Olivier, it was definitely worth taking that risk, and the chances of hitting gold were much, much higher."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll say one other thing that was important, I think, is what a lot of people say--especially people from the Deep South--is that it really sounds like the Deep South," Fox added. "I think that was really down to the sound recordings that were done/taken in the swamps, and in the different mountains of Tennessee and Kentucky. That sound design also really grounded everything, so that you could go a bit wild with the music and go somewhere different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624042"></a><figcaption>Hazel sitting on top of Catfish in a swamp.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624042-south-of-midnight-hazel-catfish.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That creativity Fox spoke of shines through with the use of childrens' voices throughout the game, in both gameplay and the soundtrack. One of the most notable pieces of audio in South of Midnight plays when you use the Guiding Strand--a ghostly line that directs you to your next objective.</p><p dir="ltr">You hear a child's voice whisper "Hazel" in the direction you need to go, and it happens every time you use that navigational tool. The game also features singing children in a lot of the music. They feel like supernatural entities that inform, motivate, guide, and fight alongside you on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't want to call them spirits. We didn't want to call them ghosts. We didn't want to call them magic. We wanted [them] to be free of all these, sort of, clichés," Derivière said. "It's like an energy around you, you know--the strands. Using the kids was the key for the voices--the vocals. The key to, all of a sudden, make those strands real. And that was because you see some ghosts, of course… There is this connection. But this is through the strands. And the strands are the kids."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière often mentioned that the kids are "the stars of the show." Explaining that they're with you from beginning to end, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Fox echoed this statement, going deeper into how the children--five girls from a Gospel church in Nashville--are used in the audio design.</p><p dir="ltr">The five girls recorded audio for a wide variety of gameplay moments, in addition to their singing for the soundtrack and musical roles. The audio team sampled giggling, whispers, yelling, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were this amazing group of five girls from the local Gospel church. That's why [Olivier] said [they're the] stars of the show, to go back to that, because they really are everywhere," Fox explained. "This is the genius of Olivier. When you come close to an object or space, there's a value that gets more intense or less intense, to give you that feeling of you're approaching something of power. So it's really great. It was a great project to work with Olivier and see what could be done with voice."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624035"></a><figcaption>One of the ghostly children in South of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624035-south-of-midnight-molly-child.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Music and songs with vocals are such large parts of South of Midnight, but it almost didn't start out that way, according to Derivière.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the beginning of the project, we didn't have any idea that there would be songs in the game--not at all," Derivière said. "At some point, David Sears, the creative director, said, 'I don't want music.' And that was like, oh, okay, so he's talking to the composer right now, and he says, 'I don't want this.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"And so the more we're discussing, the more it was like, 'Okay, we need songs.' Because, number one, it's traditional from the South. You know, songs are very embedded into the culture there. But also, we wanted the songs to be part of the overall narrative. And so this is where David and the team, over there, the narrative team came with some lyrics."</p><p dir="ltr">These conversations came during the year-long planning process that took place in the very early stages of development. Fox added a few more details about the team's thought process during those times as well. He revealed that the songs were complete long before other aspects of the game.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the project, we didn't have any idea that there would be songs in the game--not at all.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"Definitely a challenge because, for us, we wanted to create 2D art to inform 3D level art. We were like, 'Could we make songs that could inform level music?' Which is a bit of a novel way of thinking," Fox explained. "For a long time, all we had was the songs, because we were waiting for the game to be finished enough that we could start integrating. [It] was really important to work with the narrative team. And the narrative team actually contributed to some of the lyrics, and David Sears also contributed to the lyrics."</p><p dir="ltr">The idea of making songs that informed level music was implemented successfully through the unique way in which South of Midnight delivers its songs in pieces as you move through a level. As you learn more about a creature or character's trauma, lyrics are added to an incomplete song a few lines at a time. Then, at the end of the level, you hear the full song for the first time, creating an impactful moment.</p><p dir="ltr">This happens several times throughout the game to explore different themes with several creatures or characters who are central to the plot. We get guilt with Benjy, anger with Two-Toed Tom, and so on. It's incredible when the incomplete tunes build to eventually become the boss's theme song at the end of a chapter. But it's equally impressive that the songs aren't too on the nose when it comes to transforming each character's story into music.</p><p dir="ltr">"We didn't want the song to be like, 'The story was that, and it happened like this,' you know? It was not like that," Derivière said. "It was more like, okay, we want the song to be sort of abstract, but connected with what was going on."</p><p dir="ltr">"We rearranged the songs so [that] it's the kids singing when you're in the level, and at the end, it's the creature [or person]," Derivière explained. "So the kids singing is sort of a corrupted version--a weird version of the song. You have an idea, and it feels like it's disturbing, because David is a very, let's say, dark person [laughs]. You don't want the song to be beautiful whatsoever in the levels, because the levels themselves are scary in some parts.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox adds to this explanation, saying, "I had this idea of--I don't want to say dark and light--but corrupted and uncorrupted. And I was like, would it be really interesting, when [starting] the level, you were obscured from any understanding of the trauma of this zone or creature? But then, as you go through, and you do these narrative events, you would get a bit of a melody."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624076" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624076"></a><figcaption>Hazel looks up at the Benjy tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4624076-south-of-midnight-benjy-tree.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking about these standout junctures in South of Midnight with Christopher Fox led to a discussion of what makes music memorable in games. I shared that, oftentimes, I don't really notice a game soundtrack unless it's attached to a notable event or evokes emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know what you mean," Fox said. "It's like [the] Ashtray Maze in Control. And then you've got the balance. [If] it's happening all the time, is it special anymore? So you know there's [a reason] why those bits pop out in those Remedy games where they're really memorable because it's not all the time. But I think we somehow managed to make something that didn't get tiresome, because it was always changing."</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight's musical formula didn't get tiresome, in my eyes (and ears), because each big song is tied to a completely different form of hardship that comes from separate backstories. At a certain point, it was the mystery of what happened to the creature or character, mixed with what the music represents, that kept me wanting more.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [music] represented the trauma of each creature," Fox said. "So each creature had something like ravenous guilt, loss. There were main themes that were established early for each creature. Hopefully, the [music] represents that."</p><p dir="ltr">A few of my favorite tracks in South of Midnight were Huggin' Molly, Rougarou, and Altamaha-Ha because of how they enhanced the stories behind those creatures. This is especially true of Altamaha-Ha, whose tale is about an enslaved woman who lost her child when escaping from captivity. The vocalist, Stacy Subero, sings it beautifully. Fox echoed similar sentiments.</p><p dir="ltr">"My favorite song is the Altamaha-Ha song because it's just... I feel like quite a few people cry at the end of that one, which is an amazing feat for someone who's involved with audio," Fox said. "When we got that song in particular that Olivier wrote, and then [it] was performed by Stacey, the lead singer, and all the backup vocals… I never thought [that] in a video game I would get a song like that."</p><p dir="ltr">Derivière praises the performances for both Rougarou and Altamaha-Ha. I asked about studio sessions, and he shared what it was like hearing Joey Richey for Rougarou and Stacy Subero for Altamaha-Ha.</p><p dir="ltr">"For instance, you're talking Rougarou. You know, that was an amazing performance, because at some point, you know, he goes super loud like, 'I break my bones!' Oh, my God, and he didn't have the orchestra yet," Derivière said. "He didn't know. It was just the piano. He was alone with the piano. And I was like, 'You need to give it all because this is the moment.'</p><p dir="ltr">"It was the same with Altamaha-Ha with Stacey. I mean, my God, how amazing she was. And then we had the choir--the adults. They were amazing--super dark and warm. You can feel it when you listen to them, but it's just happening in real time. And this is when you hope that the engineer didn't forget to press record. You're like, 'Please, tell me you have the take!'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624032"></a><figcaption>Shakin' Bones plays a tune for Hazel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1775/17752664/4624032-south-of-midnight-bones-guitar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Compulsion Games developed a soundtrack full of soulful performances and meaning that works perfectly for South of Midnight, but also extends beyond the confines of a single game. The music strengthens the game's themes of loss, hardship, hope, and more, in combination with wonderfully creative audio design, to create a wholly fantastic listening experience that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025s-biggest-snubs/2900-7272/">didn't receive the recognition it deserved</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope that many, many more players get to experience South of Midnight's auditory feast when it comes to PS5 and Switch 2 in Spring 2026.</p>

              <p><span>The Pokémon Company seems likely t</span><span>o reveal the upcoming Generation X games in February on the series’ 30th anniversary, but if leakers have anything to say about it, Game Freak might not have much new information to give us by the time that showcase arrives. On December 24, a series of new leaks about the games, allegedly titled </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>, began spreading online. We’ve gotten a few waves (sorry) of information since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>the massive Teraleak</span></a><span> in October, but now we know a little bit more about the games’ map, battle gimmick, and have even our first look at the new region’s professor.</span></p> <p><span>The latest info was posted on X early today by self-described <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2003786462651932797">Pokémon detective Moot Monthly</a>. All of these new images, animations, and illustrations are reportedly from this existing leak, so it’s entirely possible they aren’t indicative of the final games that will eventually ship on Switch 2. But they do give us some interesting insight into what Game Freak has been working on for the next mainline entries.&nbsp;</span></p>

Apparently, the professor will ride around in a car and appear in multiple locations in the games’ archipelago setting. Right now, all we know is that he appears to be an older man with thick eyebrows and a beard.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="de" dir="ltr">Pokémon Gen 10 leak: the new Professor (he drives around in a car!) and how the new Pokémon Centers will look <a href="https://t.co/erGuj76bUM">https://t.co/erGuj76bUM</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2003838143943094555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Speaking of the archipelago, we also have a new illustration of the Gen X region. Its beta map shows several islands that the player will be able to explore. Early reports say they will be procedurally generated, so it’s unclear if the map is a sort of presumed “default” shape for these islands or if the terrain is what changes for each player, rather than the shape of the landmass.&nbsp;</span></p>

What we can see for now is that this phenomenon will seemingly distort a Pokémon’s physical shape and then create some kind of cloud to obscure them. Looking at what this shit does to Pikachu in the leaked animation, I’m not immediately onboard. But hey, it’s leaked in-development footage from a hack. We’ll see how it actually changes up battles when the games are eventually revealed.</span></p>

For now, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is keeping me busy, so I’m not starving for something new right now.</span></p>

      <p>It is once again, depending on who you ask, the most wonderful time of the year. Presents are under trees, lights are looking downright strewn, and snow is on the ground where climate change still permits that to happen. To celebrate the occasion, we got ourselves a little gift: two weeks of blissful (mostly) rest.&nbsp;</p><p>From now until January 4 or so, things are going to be a little quieter than usual around here.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-currently-down-no-word-from-valve/</link>
            <guid>1391860</guid>

			<p><strong>Update 24/12/2025 3:36 pm EST - </strong>The Steam store and website are back online. Altogether, the store was only offline for a little over an hour. You can go back to redeeming those gift cards and squeezing every cent out of them during the Winter Sale.</p>



<p>That said, we may not be entirely out of the woods yet, so if you're still having issues, maybe just give it a little more time.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>If you're sat at home trying to peruse the Steam Winter Sale, but can't get anything beyond a black screen on the Steam app or an Error message on the website, fret not - it's not your family home's poor WiFi. <strong>Steam is currently down,</strong> and it's unclear as to when it'll be back online.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no notice from Valve as to what is causing the issue, as Steam and the website have been down for the past hour. Thousands of reports have been flooding <a href="https://downdetector.ca/status/steam/">DownDetector</a> since the issues started, and the <a href="https://steamstat.us/">unofficial status on SteamDB</a> shows that over 250K people have visited the site to see what's happening with Steam.</p>



<p>It's an unfortunate time for the digital storefront to be offline, as surely there are millions of players around the world excited to redeem their gift cards for the digital storefront and see what they can knock off their wishlist at a supreme discount.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, the Winter Sale doesn't end until January 5, 2026, by which time you can expect Valve to have fixed whatever is causing the issue. In the meantime, if you haven't already, you can head over to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">the Epic Games Store to redeem today's free game, The Callisto Protocol</a>. </p>



<p>And once you're done that, you can continue waiting for Steam to be back online, since, <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/">as <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong> explained in a recent interview,</a> the Epic Games Store isn't a home for PC players, but Steam is.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>People are not, basically, using EGS as their home, it’s not home to them. I don’t know if it’s deliberate or not, but EGS doesn’t have written reviews. They don’t have the forums.

<p>When it comes to single-player games, 2025 offered no shortage of memorable experiences. Big sequels, ambitious new IPs, and long-anticipated releases all took turns dominating the conversation, making it one of the more competitive years in recent memory. With so many strong options on the table, the Insider Gaming community had plenty to consider when casting their votes.</p>



<p>In the end, one game stood above the rest. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been voted the Insider Gaming community’s Best Single Player Game of 2025.</p>







<p>In a poll hosted on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>, Clair Obscur finished first with 22.6% percent of the votes. Sandfall Interactive’s RPG edged out a packed field that included Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Dispatch.</p>



<p>The result also lines up with the game’s wider reception. Clair Obscur has been universally acclaimed by fans and holds a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">9.6 user score</a> on Metacritic.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-the-votes-shook-out">How The Votes Shook Out</h2>



<p>As mentioned, the poll was filled with worthy recipients. Dispatch finished second with 14.8% of the vote, while Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 followed at 12.2%. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Death Stranding 2 each earned 11.3%, highlighting just how divided the community was among several games.</p>



<p>What ultimately pushed Clair Obscur ahead was how strongly it resonated with players. Rather than leaning on spectacle or familiar franchise beats, the game delivered a focused, self-contained experience that trusted its atmosphere and presentation to do the heavy lifting. Its distinct visual style and deliberate pacing helped it stand out in a year crowded with massive releases.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The PSN January Sale is now on with big savings]]></title>

		<p>As tradition, the PSN January Sale has kicked off before Christmas so it can tempt you to spend those PSN Gift cards straight away.&nbsp; Also as tradition, the savings depend on where you are in the world so there’s no easy way to collate them all but hopefully this should give you an idea of what’s on offer.</p>
<p>The final tradition is that the banner adverts on the store lie, you can actually save up to 90%, not 75%.</p>


<p>There are some really good offers this time, especially if you are picking up older games. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-ultimate-edition/">Control: Ultimate Edition</a> is cheaper than a pint and under £6 so if you have not played that, then you really should grab it, and I can also recommend <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/still-wakes-the-deep/">Still Wakes The Deep: The Complete Edition</a>, which is a few pennies over £13. You are also completely mad if you don’t pick up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/limbo/">Limbo</a> AND Inside for £2.19.</p>
<p>A word of warning, the store is still packed full of rubbish shovelware, but if you really want to jack up your Platinum trophy count then Beanball is on sale for seven pence – yes, 7p – and you can get the Plat in 5 mins.</p>
<p>More recent games with savings include <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-f/">Silent Hill f</a>, <span><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, and ARC Raiders. I think I am going to grab <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dispatch/">Dispatch.</a></span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nikita Tells Us What He Wants from Tarkov on Console: ‘The Same Frustrating Experience’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/</link>
            <guid>1391839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We recently sat down with Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, creator of Escape from Tarkov. Amongst other things, we took a dive into the concept of Escape from Tarkov coming to consoles, which is something that the developer teased at the recent Tokyo Game Show event.</p>



<p>In his own words, Nikita has stressed that an Escape from Tarkov console port wouldn’t be made ‘easier’. In fact, it would be ‘the same frustrating experience’ that players have been experiencing on PC for many years, retaining that hardcore, unwelcoming vibe.</p>



<p>It’s his mission to make players break controllers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-would-escape-from-tarkov-on-console-look-like">What Would Escape from Tarkov on Console Look Like?</h2>



<p>Many have surmised that Escape from Tarkov on PlayStation or Xbox would represent a slimmed-down, ‘lite’ version of the tough-as-nails extraction shooter. But after catching up with Nikita Buyanov on the most recent episode of Insider Gaming’s Access Granted, we have gathered a different picture entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure that it would be a ‘lite’ version of EFT. The main goal is to create the same experience for the consoles, so there won’t be any kind of aim assist, any simplifiying of the gaming features.</p>



<p>I really want to get the same frustrating experience for the consoles, to bring on this hardcore feeling to a wider audience.</p>



<p>We don’t plan to conquer something, we just want to create something new for the consoles, something new, a new experience, because they’ve never had that before, I mean the true hardcore experience that will break their controllers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Nikita made the ‘frustrating experience’ comment with a chuckle! </p>



<p>Nikita explained what the challenges are. It’s a discussion mostly centered around the complexity of Escape from Tarkov, which features inventory and health management, survival mechanics, and most importantly, <strong>stacks </strong>of keybinds that only a keyboard and mouse player can realistically handle.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It won’t be something simplified or a casual version of EFT. It will be the same EFT, but of course it needs to be optimized for the current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>The main challenge will be to put in all the controls. It will be the main challenge for us, but in general, I think it will be pretty interesting to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that Escape from Tarkov only hit ‘full release’ in November, it might be ambitious to believe that Battlestate Games will muster up a console version any time soon. The only thing to go on is Nikita’s mention of ‘current-gen consoles’ for any kind of a timeline.</p>



<p>If you want to check out the full interview with Nikita, you can do so on the Insider Gaming app, available now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.insidergaming.app">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insider-gaming/id6753984648">iOS</a>. It’s available exclusively for Insider Gaming Premium subscribers.</p>
