It’s a pretty campy film, featuring some over-the-top performances and questionable CGI. But it was also a hit at the box office, even leading to a few sequels. And now, there are plans to turn the film into a comedy. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/news/anaconda-reboot-jack-black-paul-rudd-tom-gormican-1236114564/?ref=upstract.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/anaconda-reboot-jack-black-paul-rudd-tom-gormican-1236114564/?ref=upstract.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On August 21, <em>Variety</em> reported</a></span> that Black and Rudd were in talks to star in a new <em>Anaconda </em>reboot/re-imagining from <em>Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F</em> writer Tom Gormican, who will also direct the movie. According to <em>Variety</em>, the new <em>Anaconda</em> won’t be a remake of the original. Instead, it’s reportedly about a group of friends who are all facing “mid-life crises.” So they decide to remake their favorite movie, which I assume will be <em>Anaconda</em>. But once they arrive in the jungle, “things get real quickly.” </p><p><em>Variety </em>reports that while they don’t yet know who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jack-black-trump-joke-kyle-gass-tenacious-d-borderlands-1851615478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jack-black-trump-joke-kyle-gass-tenacious-d-borderlands-1851615478">Jack Black</a></span> and Paul Rudd will play in the movie, two of the lead characters are described as a wannabe director and a failed semi-famous actor. </p><h2 id="h2167"><a id=""></a>A meta-comedy reboot of <em>Anaconda </em>misses the point</h2><p>Now, to be clear: I don’t think 1997's <em>Anaconda </em>is some incredible masterpiece that should be treated as an untouchable piece of pop culture history. </p><p>It’s a campy, over-the-top giant monster movie featuring bad CG (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/d_RGsKf7wqc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/d_RGsKf7wqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but great practical puppetry</a></span>) and some wild moments. However, the key reason the film works is that it feels earnest. It doesn’t wink at the audience constantly or go, “Yeah, we know this is silly and dumb, too.” That helps it feel less like a bunch of people made something bad and wasted your time and more like a movie made by people who cared. </p><p>Sure, the <em>Anaconda </em>cast and crew didn’t make the next American classic, but in the end, they made something memorable, fun, and enjoyable to watch. If I had to guess, a meta-comedy about people who liked <em>Anaconda </em>going to the jungle and making jokes about <em>Anaconda</em> the whole time likely won’t turn out to be memorable, fun, or enjoyable. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/CNQpgCWJA6I?t=175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/CNQpgCWJA6I?t=175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It will probably just lead to me wanting a giant snake to appear and eat me.</a></span> </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a moment in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> that would be the perfect visual metaphor for the game’s hopeful, proud ascension as China’s big breakthrough into the Western AAA pantheon. Unfortunately, that moment is restricted, and we can’t talk about that.<br></p><p>There are moments in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> of such enthralling beauty and visual poetry and mythmaking unlike almost anything in the current AAA gaming space right now. We can’t show them to you or discuss their contents.</p><p>There are reams of lore and mythology and parables and morality plays, dancing with such wild abandon with fantastical, whimsical, imaginative character work and design, giving depth and beauty and context to the otherwise quite obtuse narrative of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. We can’t tell you anything about them.</p><p>There is something to be said about the fact that, despite being a rather major, all-encompassing element in the original texts, the goddess Guanyin is such a marginalized part of the game’s narrative. But, while reviewers aren’t restricted on “feminist propaganda” as streamers are, since discussing it requires delving into the particulars of the story–you guessed it–we can’t talk about that.</p><p>That leaves precisely two things to really, substantively say about <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>: It’s extremely pretty, and it’s not trying to ape (ha) FromSoftware’s work as much as you might think. Fortunately and probably not coincidentally, those are the two biggest positives the game has going for it.</p><h2 id="h2122"><a id=""></a>A legendary story, retold for those who already know it</h2><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a sort of lopsided retelling of <em>Journey to the West</em>, one of China’s seminal pieces of literature. Imagine if Tolkien had written <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> 400 years earlier, and it was more explicitly about the Crusades and included Bible stories and also Jesus’ apostles were all anthropomorphic animals who God let out on a work-release program, and you have a vague idea of just how important that novel is for China. </p><figure id="" data-id="58dc68b8eab4f1c9c81ecde51fb3e67d" data-recommend-id="image://58dc68b8eab4f1c9c81ecde51fb3e67d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character leaps at a flaming enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character leaps at a flaming enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="58dc68b8eab4f1c9c81ecde51fb3e67d" data-recommend-id="image://58dc68b8eab4f1c9c81ecde51fb3e67d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character leaps at a flaming enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The iconography’s managed to sneak out into other cultures from time to time. Most famously, Akira Toriyama’s <em>Dragon Ball</em> universe is chock full of repurposed references to it. For gamers, Ninja Theory’s wonderful, underappreciated <em>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</em> is perhaps the most direct retelling, though references can be found in everything from Capcom’s <em>Son Son</em> (even moreso in <em>Marvel vs Capcom 2</em>’s reimagining of the character) to Ubisoft’s <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>. It’s kind of a big deal, is the point here. So, GameScience betting the AAA farm on a big-budget interactive version of that novel as their attempt to graduate China’s games industry past the mobile titles and gacha games that built it in recent years makes total sense. It just would’ve been nice if they bothered to include the rest of us.<br></p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> tells the story of <em>Journey to the West</em> in a way that will make absolutely zero sense to anyone not thoroughly and academically versed in <em>Journey to the West. </em>It’s not like it can’t be done in an accessible way; the aforementioned <em>Enslaved</em> manages to do a pretty decent job of it, but also, there’s a very good and very fun film adaptation directed by Stephen Chow of <em>Shaolin Soccer</em> and <em>Kung Fu Hustle</em> fame (<span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B09X26QFSV/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B09X26QFSV" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">it’s on Prime Video right this second, in fact</a></span>). </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s telling is sort of a greatest hits package, focusing on a lowly ape warrior known only as the Destined One, who sets out to collect aspects of the fabled Monkey King Sun Wukong in the hopes of resurrecting him in one way or another. That’s all well and good, but <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has no interest in taking us on that journey in any cohesive way. There are plenty of erstwhile companions adding color commentary to the journey, some of whom are even endearing. There is lore, and lots of it. Nearly every enemy the Destined One meets gets a lore entry that might as well be its own bespoke novel; many of them are wonderful to read, and most of them have little to no connection to what’s happening in the game at the moment you beat them. </p><p>Worse yet, when you do come across characters with personalities and stories worth investing in who are changed by the Destined One’s actions, by the time they get interesting, the Chapter is over, and Chapter breaks will completely interrupt the story at hand and stick the Destined One in a new place, at a new time, with new characters acting like they’ve always been there. </p><p>Sure, <em>Souls</em> games have been playing coy with narrative since 2009, but the big difference there is how much of the story is baked into the world itself, its landmarks, its ravished lands, in the designs of the enemies. These biomes, pretty as they are, do not tell stories beyond their innate, natural beauty, at least not in any organic way that conveys reasons to fight for it. There is lore, there is respect for the land itself, but not narrative or storytelling. To belabor the <em>LOTR</em> comparisons, it plays like an Oops! All Appendices cut of the Peter Jackson films, a neverending pile of ancillary details that don’t actually further our understanding of the core story. People who intimately know the original novel will likely be rather pleased by how the game brings its legendary figures to life, and those players can fill in the blanks on where exactly in the story each chapter is meant to take place, but it fails pretty miserably as an on-ramp to everything magical about <em>Journey to the West</em>.<br></p><h2 id="h2123"><a id=""></a>Truly awe-inspiring visuals</h2><p>At least what’s there is awfully nice to look at. Make no mistake, the game <em>is</em> utterly fucking gorgeous. The game will take you on a whirlwind tour of ancient China, from forest to desert to snowy mountains, and even its most mundane moments of hanging out in nondescript patches of undisturbed nature are absolutely breathtaking in fidelity. The creature design is also top notch, pulling off that latter-day <em>Planet of the Apes</em>-style miracle where you stop seeing the seams of these characters, and you just start seeing the anthropomorphized enemies as believable people of various shapes/sizes/leg counts. It all just feels lifelike and believable. Between this and <em>Hellblade II</em>, Unreal Engine 5 is getting the chance to show off this year, and the results are the first time I’ve truly been awed by a game’s visuals this entire generation.</p><figure id="" data-id="85865096e303d2adde98c1f33a8522ad" data-recommend-id="image://85865096e303d2adde98c1f33a8522ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs to the left while engaged in combat with a strange-looking enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character runs to the left while engaged in combat with a strange-looking enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85865096e303d2adde98c1f33a8522ad" data-recommend-id="image://85865096e303d2adde98c1f33a8522ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character runs to the left while engaged in combat with a strange-looking enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At least, that was the case when I had the settings cranked all the way up and used Photo Mode, because oh, you bet your ass that beauty has a cost, and even when trying it out on a laptop with an RTX 4090, putting all the settings on Cinematic–the highest setting–with Ray Tracing on felt like a recipe for causing one of those white <em>Akira</em> explosions that birth a universe. It was a <em>struggle</em>. Still, your average player’s gonna be playing on much lesser hardware. The laptop I spent most of my time playing on is running an RTX 3080, and even with most settings just on High and Ray Tracing off, it’s not only still very pretty but relatively steady, though later areas can be a little dicey with the stutters. God help the poor PS5 having to run this thing over 30fps.<br></p><h2 id="h2124"><a id=""></a>Fresh ideas, numerous frustrations</h2><p>Still, story? Looks? A <em>Souls</em> player craves not these things. Someone who comes into the game looking for that good old FromSoft-style challenge will be…somewhat satisfied, I suppose. The greatest compliment one can pay is that the game is at least thinking about combat mechanics in a way largely unique to itself. </p><p>The Destined One’s basic maneuvers involve running, jumping and thwacking enemies with a staff. Far more damaging Heavy attacks are available, but only once you’ve built up enough energy in the small Focus meter in the lower-right of the screen. There are three different stances available, but no variations on the basic combo you spam with each, even with a fairly extensive skill tree. You can sprint, jump, and dodge, but every action costs stamina. You have a <strike>flask</strike> gourd that you can use to heal on demand. Every enemy drops <strike>runes</strike> Will, which can be spent on upgrades and items at shrines scattered throughout the world. And the lands are chock full of giant bosses to learn and defeat. It seems, at the outset, like it’s going to play ball like a <em>Souls</em> game, albeit one that hasn’t quite figured out how to make the bread-and-butter basic weapon combat feel genuinely impactful for dozens of hours. </p><p>The first time a boss landed a massive hit, sending my heroic monkey friend to the shadow realm with thousands of Will on hand, that old heart-shattering feeling of failure did indeed take hold. I started thinking about the best route to get to my corpse, get my stuff back, and who I’d have to kill again along the way. And that’s when I realized <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> actually doesn’t punish you for death and you hold onto anything you’ve earned permanently. </p><p>Early on, this is a blessing. Especially compared to how <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> put the boots to us all <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgLlqM2p11A&amp;pp=ygUvcHV0IHRoZSBib290cyB0byBoaW0gbWVkaXVtIHN0eWxlIG1ldGFsb2NhbHlwc2U%3D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgLlqM2p11A&amp;pp=ygUvcHV0IHRoZSBib290cyB0byBoaW0gbWVkaXVtIHN0eWxlIG1ldGFsb2NhbHlwc2U%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medium style</a></span> a couple months ago, a game of this sort giving its players more license to fuck up is freeing. That’s particularly important once the Destined One’s myriad magic powers come into play and you’re drowning in an overabundance of ways to deal with problems. One of the more brilliant touches that actually ties the game mechanics to its source material is the Transformation system, whereby the Destined One can absorb the energy from particularly difficult and powerful enemies and actually become them, embodying the enemy’s entire moveset, or executing one single, powerful move. That system is fun, rewards experimentation, and introduces vast variety that the basic, spammy staff combat desperately needs.</p><p>The magic alone can’t quite uplift <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s combat to the heights it’s aiming for, though. The game remains deeply unbalanced. You have the joy of the Destined One’s powers, offset by how soft and spongy the base combos feel. You have the beautiful environments and the quiet poetry of its major landmarks, which remains enthralling until you realize just how little one can truly wander off the beaten path. Even then, as beautiful as the organic landscape can be, it’s terrible at giving players landmarks to get their bearings or go wandering off in a branching direction without getting locked into a boss fight. </p><figure id="" data-id="0baf542615eec7d65dd7d378b14ccdb8" data-recommend-id="image://0baf542615eec7d65dd7d378b14ccdb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character crouches in the foreground holding a staff that's glowing red-hot at both ends before a large lizard- or dragon-like enemy in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character crouches in the foreground holding a staff that's glowing red-hot at both ends before a large lizard- or dragon-like enemy in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baf542615eec7d65dd7d378b14ccdb8" data-recommend-id="image://0baf542615eec7d65dd7d378b14ccdb8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character crouches in the foreground holding a staff that's glowing red-hot at both ends before a large lizard- or dragon-like enemy in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That problem’s compounded by the fact that there’s no in-game map to pick up the slack, and especially in later chapters, checkpoints go from being 5-10 minutes of gameplay away to being 15-20 minutes away. It’s a world of wonderfully realized foes–some of which do manage to punch through to that upper echelon of FromSoft enemy design–who flit between rote pushovers you can light-attack spam to death, and brick walls who will stop you in your tracks for hours on end, with no real flow to how those enemies are placed to maintain the adrenaline of a good stretch of gameplay until the tail end of a chapter.<br></p><p>I want to be able to tell you that the fight is worth it, that getting the game running at the highest settings possible on your rig is worth it, that there are stories worth seeing through to the end, that the white-knuckle adrenaline pumping through your veins for particular bosses is worthwhile, and what rewards await for your victory. Because these things are true, and there is beauty to be found in various places in this game. Without the ability to go into detail, though, we’re left trying to sell you on the least interesting parts of it, the parts that the likes of<em> God of War</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> offer with much more gratification to be had right from the start.</p><h2 id="h2125"><a id=""></a>A game at odds with itself</h2><p>There is a clear love of a culture, of a myth to be found here, wrapped around a just-okay Souls-lite that’s being made to hold far too much weight on its own. Divorced of all of its pretenses of bringing one of the most famous Chinese myths to life in astonishing detail, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> isn’t necessarily a bad time, provided all you truly want and need from the game is to be an angry little magic monkey in a glorified boss rush fighting off various animals who know ancient martial arts. There are enough interesting and delightful ideas at play with its combat system to be worth experiencing as an interesting flavor of <em>Souls</em>-like at bare minimum. But anyone who goes into it with that mindset will find their path deliberately beset by the game’s epic pretenses on all sides. Good, intricate storytelling typically serves to enhance a game like this. Here, the way it’s executed, it’s an ungratifying hindrance, and there’s a <em>lot</em> of it. </p><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a game trying to please two very specific crowds. Both will end up doing extra homework to get to the goods in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> at every turn, and the game is doing itself no favors by leaving pages out of the textbook. It’s left being big and ostentatious for bigness and ostentatiousness’ sake, when the most exquisite things in it are small, quiet, thoughtful and dream-like. It’s a game whose art is at war with itself, which is awful ironic since Sun Wukong’s whole arc in <em>Journey to the West</em> involves letting go of delusions of grandeur beyond his reach, and living a life of service, meaning, and ego-less contemplation. But, again, there’s not much we can say about how the game handles that. It’s a damn shame. There’s not nearly as much worth saying otherwise. But, so be it. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> can just be another forgettable also-ran in a crowded genre. There is nothing else gamers need to hear.</p><p>There is no war in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p></div><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It feels less sanded down and polished than its obvious competitor, but that opens it up to chaos and fun plays that are no longer possible in Blizzard’s game. However, I do think the game will have to carve out its own space to get a leg up on the competition, and after taking the newly-announced Captain America and Winter Soldier for a spin, both are a lot of fun, but only further cement the notion that<em>Marvel Rivals</em> is riding <em>Overwatch</em>’s coattails.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Steve “Captain America” Rogers is a tanky Vanguard hero who makes good use of his shield. His vibranium weapon is both his best offense and defense, and gives him a versatile kit for long-range throws and close-up brawls. Throwing Cap’s shield is a pretty forgiving maneuver, as it will home in on enemies or ricochet off walls and other foes if you don’t quite land your shot. It feels really good to throw your metal frisbee and watch it hit multiple enemies before it comes back to you.</p><p>But America’s Ass’ best tool is using his shield for defense. It isn’t quite as large as Doctor Strange’s, so it can’t be used to protect your entire team. But it works well enough for Steve himself to move in and out of a scrap. The best thing it does, however, was what raised my eyebrows during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-trailers-announcements-1851627031">Gamescom presentation</a></span>: It can be used to deflect projectiles, even high-power attacks like Iron Man’s explosive ultimate. While that might sound incredibly oppressive, it’s not easy to just pop up your shield as a team-wiping ability barrels toward you. In my experience, it requires a bit of skill and precision or Tony Stark will still blow your ass up. The shield is small. So is its hitbox. It doesn’t feel like an easy get-out-of-jail-free card, which I hope means it will be an irregular skill play rather than something that renders ranged attacks useless.</p><p>While Cap may have some distinct abilities, swaths of his kit feel derivative of <em>Overwatch</em> heroes like several other characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ roster. His ultimate is nearly identical to Brigitte’s Rally, which buffs him and surrounding allies with additional health. If you were one of the <em>Overwatch</em> players who always thought Brigitte was meant to be a tank in the old <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jeff-kaplan-knows-some-people-will-always-hate-overwatc-1831624036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jeff-kaplan-knows-some-people-will-always-hate-overwatc-1831624036">GOATS meta days</a></span>, it has finally materialized in Captain America. He also gets Soldier: 76’s sprint, who was mostly <em>Overwatch</em>’s Captain America stand-in before he became a Batman stand-in. So this is really just a full-circle trade-off.</p><p>Bucky also feels like an amalgamation of <em>Overwatch </em>heroes, albeit slightly unexpected ones. A damage-driven Duelist hero, Winter Soldier feels like Roadhog and Doomfist. He has a shotgun that fires off two shells before reloading, but unlike Roadhog, he can’t take out an enemy in two shots. He instead relies on his mechanical arm to draw enemies in close and then combos it with a<em> </em>Doomfist uppercut. It’s a nasty combo that if you follow up with well-placed shots can take an enemy out in a split second. But it also feels like it’s born from looking at <em>Overwatch</em>’s roster and trying to find ways to graft multiple hero abilities onto a much more recognizable character.</p><p>I’m still largely of the mind that <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ drawing from <em>Overwatch </em>is fine, and I enjoy the game bringing back mechanics that no longer exist in Blizzard’s game like Adam Warlock having Mercy’s long-gone team resurrection. But it’s going to need more characters like Jeff the Land Shark that don’t feel as easy to describe with <em>Overwatch </em>shorthand in order to carve out its own space. I’m looking forward to seeing NetEase try to forge its own identity when <em>Marvel Rivals </em>launches on December 6.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Techland recently announced Dying Light: The Beast, a new standalone title in the franchise that came about when the team was working on the second expansion for 2022’s Dying Light 2. As it grew to epic proportions, Techland decided to simply make it an entirely new game, creating a fresh region to explore, fusing the title with new mechanics, and bringing back a fan-favourite character.</p>



<p>In The Beast, players once again assume control of Kyle Crane, the protagonist from the first game that was released way back in 2015. At Gamescom, I caught up with Roger Craig Smith who walked me through what it has been like to step back into the role of Kyle Crane for Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unleash-the-beast">Unleash The Beast</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is an 18-hour standalone game that’s less expansive than a full Dying Light title but way meatier than ‘just’ a DLC. It introduces players to a new region that’s diverse and made up of ‘biomes’, bringing back vehicles, boosting some in-game mechanics, and offering up fresh weather systems, along with other elements.</p>



<p>It stars Kyle Crane, who has escaped years of experimentation and is out on a revenge mission, fuelled by new ‘beast-like’ abilities. </p>



<p>I sat down with Roger Craig Smith, the voice of Kyle Crane, to find out what it’s like coming back to that role after so many years away.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To come back to a character like Kyle Crane after ten years is an honour. It’s really kind of neat, you just go, ‘Man, who would have thought?’ This game that kind of came out of nowhere and just exploded and has had such strong replayability that fans spent a ton of time in that world. </p>



<p>It’s a blast – it’s absolutely surreal, it’s an honour, and it also makes me feel old.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One element that we talked about is how Kyle Crane has aged or grown as a character. In the first game, he was a bit more happy-go-lucky and sarcastic despite being in the midst of a zombie outbreak. Now, he’s on the tail-end of years of suffering and is much more grizzled.</p>



<p>But how did this translate into Roger’s acting of Kyle Crane?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This Kyle is a much darker Kyle. He’s suffered so much trauma at the hands of the antagonist, and so we have to implement that while trying to thread the connection between Dying Light 1’s Kyle Crane and this version of Kyle Crane that’s taking place many years later. </p>



<p>So, it’s a fun challenge – and I really did enjoy it… Dying Light 1’s Kyle is more sarcastic, and it’s fun to try and pepper some of that in. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Having that creative freedom and undergoing what we named a ‘cathartic’ experience assuming the more ‘beastly’ and guttural role of this new Kyle Crane means that players are in for a wonderful performance by Roger Craig Smith. </p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast doesn’t have a release date just yet, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for all the latest news when it does drop.</p>

Lovecraft’s body of cosmic horror writing was so prolific that his name has become synonymous with the genre. For Lovecraft, much of the horror of the unknowable evil in the universe was represented by the animalistic fear of the ocean, hence the foggy seaside fishing villages of New England constantly serving as the setting for his stories. That intrinsic link between fishing and cosmic horror is portrayed excellently in <em>Dredge.</em></p><p>In <em>Dredge </em>you control a nameless and faceless fisherman who has washed up on the shore of a remote fishing village on an island. It is one of many islands in a vast ocean teaming with life. In order to make some money and contribute to your new base of operations, the mayor of the village tasks you with fishing in order to bring in some cash. The only warning he gives is to not go out at night. During the day, you’ll roam the safe waters to fish and salvage for items that can all help you turn a profit, though you only have so many daylight hours to get things done. Eventually, night arrives and you are presented with the choice to return to safety or explore what awaits you in the dark. The game doesn’t force you to venture into that uncomfortable unknown.</p><figure id="" data-id="27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-recommend-id="image://27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Team17</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-recommend-id="image://27a6bcdb4d86b9e0ad91bf5471f22fc8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sea monster chases after a small fishing boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, you will eventually find yourself out past curfew on the open ocean. It might take days for it to happen, but either you’ll finally let curiosity get the better of you or just find you’ve lost track of time and are suddenly plunged into the night. Then <em>Dredge </em>turns into full-blown horror. At night, everything weird that has been hinted at happening behind your back appears: Mutilated and deformed fish infected with some mysterious disease flood your fishing lines, large creatures chase after you without the safety of the daylight, and mysterious strangers task you with finding mysterious objects that grant you dangerous powers with a cost. <em>Dredge </em>becomes much more than just a game about fishing and making money. </p><p>Like so many cosmic horror stories that have clearly inspired <em>Dredge</em>, at the end of the day (or night) there is nothing you as the player can really do to combat these unknowable horrors. <em>Dredge </em>gives you no guns or any way to protect yourself from the monsters of the deep beyond a light to keep them at bay for a while. It’s a lesson in managing your curiosity and hubris. When you inevitably push your luck too far and die, it’s because you tried to get too close to the evils in the ocean despite everything warning you to stay away. This is why <em>Dredge</em>’s horror works so well: it thrives on letting you put yourself in scary situations. </p><p>Yet even while it’s a thrilling cosmic horror showcase, <em>Dredge</em>’s management-style gameplay loop of fishing and returning to port to make a profit and upgrade your boat remains endlessly compelling. Even if you aren’t tracking down the mysteries of the deep it’s never not fun to sit in a nice fishing spot and pull up the latest catch. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I recently had the opportunity to play Atomfall at Gamescom, enjoying a lengthy playthrough of this all-new, single-player game from Rebellion. It was only this year that Atomfall was revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase, but it has already generated plenty of hype on account of the solid post-apocalyptic vibes that the game gives off – <strong>and </strong>inspired by real events.</p>



<p>Atomfall has been dubbed ‘Fallout in the UK’, and there’s some truth to that, but there’s enough meat on the bones of this game for it to stand apart from the competition that has dominated the genre for many years.</p>



<p>Read on and check out my full Atomfall preview.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-authenticity">Authenticity</h2>



<p>From the moment I stepped into Atomfall, I knew I was playing a <strong>British </strong>game. The opening sequences of my demo saw me exploring a rural (but fictional) setting in Cumbria, England. As soon as I heard the voices of enemies from across the rocky, verdant terrain, I knew exactly where I was. As I progressed, I found more characters lurking in the beautiful setting, all of them quintessentially British.</p>



<p>I even found a box of tea to consume to keep myself perked up.</p>



<p>Atomfall is inspired by true events. In 1957, the worst nuclear accident in UK history occurred at the Windscale site, causing widespread radiation to be emitted around a vast area. It was subsequently covered up by the British government – at least in part – and it took years until the full story was revealed.</p>



<p>In Atomfall, a cataclysmic event has occurred in a nuclear plant that led the government to wall off a massive area of the countryside, trapping people within and forcing them to fend for themselves, scrubbing the location from the maps. As factions rise and survivors still living in the region try to scrape through, intense mysteries emerge and an immersive story unravels.</p>



<p>I tried to question the devs on what had happened and whether we’d see anything mutated coming out of that catastrophe, but they were tight-lipped.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Atomfall - Official Gameplay Overview Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtJAU4K23ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-getting-to-the-game">Getting to the Game</h2>



<p>I love an apocalyptic title, and that’s what Atomfall is. It’s not a <strong>global </strong>apocalypse, but a downscaled version, with the end of times being concentrated in a small area in England. As I explored the game, I found myself appreciating the traditional survival elements. I had to become a hunter-gatherer of sorts, scrounging for one or two bullets while defending myself against enemy factions.</p>



<p>I quickly learned that in Atomfall, how you behave around others matters massively. Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly. In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.</p>



<p>With that being said, I asked the developers how far the freedom of this game goes, and they advised me that you can kill everyone and still complete the game. It’s very open.</p>



<p>It’s a solid ‘looter’ game that requires some inventory management, and there are a few skill paths to play around with. It’s open-ended, and the map is split up into several areas, each of which is bursting with things to see and do. If you like exploring and uncovering secrets, this game is a surefire winner.</p>



<p>It’ll take anywhere between 20 and 30 hours to complete, depending on how you approach the game. I wasn’t able to learn too much about the cataclysmic event that erupted in the nuclear plant <strong>or </strong>what the long-term ramifications of it is, but I was exposed to enough intrigue and mystery to want to play more.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>



<p>Atomfall looks brilliant on-screen and it runs well. Rebellion has put a lot of work into this game, and it feels like a living, breathing world with plenty to uncover. Everything from traversal to the stamina system feels well thought out and the voice acting is stellar from what I experienced.</p>



<p>It’ll be released in March 2025, all being well. It’s worth putting on your wishlist – take that to the bank from a die-hard post-apocalyptic gamer with a huge love for Fallout. </p>

<p>One of the longest-running turn-based strategy franchises is getting a new game for the first time in nearly a decade. Ubisoft has announced the upcoming release of Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</p>



<p>The game will release in early access on PC via Steam in Q2 2025, and is set before the events of the first game. So while it can technically be viewed as Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 8, the game is, itself, a prequel.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-heroes-of-might-amp-magic-olden-era">About Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era</h2>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is being developed by Ubisoft partner studio Unfrozen and brings back the turn-based gameplay of the series’ past.</p>



<p>“Olden Era will introduce a number of new features: Players will have more control over how they level up heroes and their factions, for example, with faction-specific abilities, new systems for learning skills and magic spells, and artifacts that now impart bonuses if players equip more than one piece from a set,” Ubisoft said.</p>



<p>Factions for this new game include Temple, Necropolis, Sylvan, Dungeon, Hive, and a surprise sixth faction to be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>As far as modes go, there will be a new campaign, a number of stand alone maps, a random map generator, and even a custom map editor. </p>



<p>For online play, players have three different options:</p>



<p>‣ <strong>Classic: </strong>a mode where a player can play with one or more heroes, upgrade the castle and explore the map.<br>‣ <strong>One-hero mode: </strong>a blitz-like system, but you have only one hero, so their demise will become yours as well!<br>‣ <strong>Arena: </strong>a mode for those who came to battle! Draft a hero, upgrade them, pick your troops, and challenge the enemy right away.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-about-heroes-of-might-amp-magic">About Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</h2>



<p>First developed by New World Computing, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic began as a spinoff of the original Might and Magic RPG series before becoming a full side franchise itself. The original Heroes of Might &amp; Magic launched in 1995. Since New World Computing’s closure in 2003, the series has been owned by Ubisoft. Under Ubisoft, there have been three Might &amp; Magic titles: Heroes of Might &amp; Magic 5, Might &amp; Magic Heroes 6, and Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7.</p>



<p>More details on the new game will be announced at a later date as early access gets close.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The bosses in Crimson Desert are powerful. I mean really <em>powerful</em>. As the formidable Staglord grabbed me by the ankle and hurled me into a wall, the bone-crunching impact reminded me of how The Stranger’s blows catapulted Kratos through tree trunks and mountains in God of War. This intense, deity-like physicality lends Crimson Desert’s battles a sense of genuine spectacle – these are the gladiator battles of myths. </p><p>During an hour-long hands-on session at gamescom 2024, I was able to go toe-to-toe with three different bosses, each of which showcased a different side of this fantasy action-adventure game's approach to battle. The first, the aforementioned Staglord, is perhaps the most simple (although that does the towering, barbarian-like warrior a disservice.) He’s a relentless attacker, charging across the battlefield like a bullet train that can suplex you at its final destination. But, despite his endless strength and capacity to throw you like a baseball, he’s only human. I force distance between us, quickly firing explosive arrows to knock him out of his attack pattern and open up a window to bury my blade into his back. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Staglord proves a real challenge of a fight. Crimson Desert is not even remotely a soulslike, but it’s not afraid to make you work really hard for victory. I spend much of the lengthy fight learning the complexities of the combat system. There’s no lock-on, so I have to be mindful of where I position my character and where his sword will land. Rolling forward allows me to instantly follow up with a sweep-kick that surprises my foe, and then hitting both the light and heavy attack buttons together unleashes a wide, particle-effects spraying strike that cleaves a chunk out of the Staglord’s health bar. All this is speedy without sacrificing weight. It feels fantastic, but it’s also easy to let things run away from you – I soon realise I need to be chowing down on health-restoring food with addiction-like frequency. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crimson Desert is not even remotely a soulslike, but it’s not afraid to make you work really hard for victory.</p></div><p>With the Staglord defeated, I take his mighty sword and shield and move on to the next fight. The demo skips ahead in the story, meaning I sadly don’t get to experience any non-boss gameplay, and throws me into snow-coated lands. Here, my gruff protagonist is looking for children who have seemingly been sacrificed to some kind of mountain god. Such a ‘god’ turns out to be the White Horn; a sort of antlered abominable snowdeer that showcases just how different each of Crimson Desert’s bosses can be. This colossal creature moves like a bucking bronco and its galloping charges cause the mountains around us to break out in miniature avalanches that leave me temporarily frozen in place. Thankfully, after striking it so much that its white fur is stained almost completely red, I’m able to clamber onto its back in the fight’s second phase and stab away at its neck. The moment had me recalling my battles with towering monsters in Dragon’s Dogma 2 earlier this year. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Each boss has three health bars, with each one eliminated increasing the intensity of the fight. But where the Staglord and White Horn scraps seemed to escalate much like many other action game boss battles – the enemy gets angrier and starts using more devastating attacks – my final battle, against the Queen Stoneback Crab, demonstrated Crimson Desert’s ambition to create memorable moments through very different mechanics. </p><p>The Queen Stoneback Crab is colossally big. It fills the screen. And, smartly, you can't fight it by just hacking away at its shins. Instead, the battle is a puzzle set piece that’s clearly inspired by Shadow of the Colossus. I clamber onto the Crab’s stony shell and grab onto the grass and flora that forms its ‘fur’, holding on for dear life while pulling myself up towards a trio of rock formations. Using a special punch skill I shatter each of the rocks to expose a weak point that I plunge my blade into. Each opened wound causes a geyser of water to blast out, which not only provides a visual spectacle but also throws me high into the air. From above I’m able to float down, almost Zelda paraglider-style, and plan how to tackle the next stage. Now I’m tasked with destroying the pottery-like crown at the peak of the Crab’s mountain-like shell – a task a Pearl Abyss employee explained to me is completed by swinging Spider-Man-style from a web and colliding with the pottery at full speed. Seriously. I’m not sure how I’d have figured that out on my own, but I’m pleased such a mechanic exists. It’s all delightfully bonkers. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>My hour-long session isn’t quite long enough to try all four bosses the demo has to offer, but a video presentation provided a quick insight into the only one I missed: the Reed Devil, a weird little guy who creates copies of himself that can only be defeated by destroying totems that are built during the battle. Along with the three I fought, all four bosses make a promise that Crimson Desert features an array of creative, unique centrepiece battles. If they’re all like this, then Pearl Abyss really could have something special on its hands. </p><p>I’m similarly impressed by the combat system’s fundamentals. Yes, it’s all quite fantasy 101 – bows, swords, shields, parries – but it’s delightfully aggressive and properly impactful. There’s a seemingly deep combo system, too, and it’s because of that I wished the demo had a section that was a little more relaxed for me to sample. The heat of a relentless boss battle isn’t quite the space to learn and perfect button sequences, but I’ve got a good feeling you can pull off some cool stuff based on the combos I did learn. </p><p>Of course, I also wish I’d seen more so I could say if Crimson Desert’s action-adventure chops are as strong as its boss battles. What little dialogue and story there was to introduce each boss didn’t suggest anything remotely close to, say, The Witcher 3. But, even if its writing proves lacking, a strong approach to exploration and world design could carry it far. Hopefully Pearl Abyss will showcase that soon, because so far Crimson Desert’s mix of God of War’s weighty  impact and Dragon’s Dogma’s creative spectacle has me very excited indeed.</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Tom Francis and his Suspicious Developments team spent 6.5 years crafting the perfect finale to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration">defenestration</a> trilogy, and it shows. If you liked blasting people out of windows in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/09/gunpoint-hands-on-an-intelligent-spy-thriller-with-breakable-glass/"><em>Gunpoint</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2017/2/"><em>Heat Signature</em></a>—or snappy writing, endearing characters, wizards, turn-based tactical gameplay, and efficiency challenges—you are going to love <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/"><em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game's name is as efficient as its design, telling you a lot about its tone and distinct offerings. You play as a small team of magic wielders, each of which you can control, one at a time,&nbsp;in a world where magic use, mana, and all the rest have been militarized and corporatized. There are stasis hexes put on illegally parked cars and even a Traffic Warlock, who, after getting on his bad side, will try to mow you down with an entire ghost highway full of spectral drivers.</p>

<p>Luckily, bad guys like him can only hit you if you don't plan accordingly. Owing to the powers of your teammate Zan, you can foresee everything that will happen within a round of combat (he's a one-second clairvoyant). Move team member Jen to this square on the grid, have her chain-zap three guys, seal the door next to her, then see what that leaves Zan to do. Don't like the outcome? Rewind repeatedly until you've gotten the most out of your team's actions or maybe achieved one of the game's optional achievements. You get "Confidence" for pulling off stunts like "knock three baddies out a window with one action," but they're entirely optional because Confidence only unlocks cool outfits, not powers or gameplay. The actual perks you unlock give you delicious choices to make, deciding which way to take each character's powers to complement or offset one another.</p>

<h2>Compelling wizard banter</h2>
<p>I've cleared the first three acts, and I'm almost certainly going to get through the rest of what the developers think is a roughly 16-hour game (on Normal difficulty) in sessions on the couch or in transit. The only thing that breaks up its session-able nature is the dialogue between scenes, levels, and acts, but I mean that in a good way. My achievement-craving brain wants to skip through the banter, and that's possible, but the buddy-cop banter is just too good to pass up. While your wizards are self-conscious enough to recognize how ridiculous the events around them are, there's just enough vulnerability and actual development to keep the plot from folding under its own irony.</p>
<p>The game looks good and sounds good, too, and it runs well on pretty much any modern system with 1GB of graphics power (that's most of them). It's listed as <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1043810">"Playable" on Steam Deck</a>, and that's accurate. The Steam Deck's trackpads help a lot here, though you can use the sticks on any controller if you're willing to nudge them around a lot inside a UI that was very much meant for a cursor.</p>
<p>Like Zan, you should be able to look just a bit into <em>Tactical Breach Wizards </em>($20 at launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">on Steam</a>) and foresee just how much you're going to enjoy it. Experiences help forge friendships, and there are few bonding experiences quite like chucking one more crooked wizard cop out the window than you thought was possible.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's something specific about Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien that makes it such an enduring classic. With the combination of its heavy focus on relatable, blue-collar characters, its dingy, lived-in capitalist version of space travel, and its stalking, unknowably malevolent creature, it creates a feeling that other horror movies have chased and tried to replicate again and again across the decades since its release.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest attempt to recapture what made Alien so viscerally, singularly frightening is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-romulus-review-structural-imperfection/1900-6418268/">Alien: Romulus</a>, a sequel to that original movie. It does a better job than some of the Alien canon of at least creating scary moments with the universe's greatest killing machine, but it relies on explosive, bombastic moments with H.R. Geiger's xenomorph, much like the rest of the series' sequels.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a solid-enough movie, but it's not frightening in the same way that Alien is frightening. Facehuggers burst from hiding and scramble over each other as they chase their prey, while xenomorphs clamber after the humans, hissing and bearing teeth, making sure to get right in the faces of the heroes as many times as possible. And at key moments, Romulus does what most of the Alien movies and games have done in the years since the original was released: It turns the creatures into cannon fodder to be blown away by machine guns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355399" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355399"></a><figcaption>Alien: Romulus tries to capture what makes the xenomorph frightening up close, but it ends up just mugging for the camera a few times.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355399-alienromulus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really only one Alien sequel that captures the essential feeling of the original film, and that sequel isn't a movie, but a video game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-isolation/" data-ref-id="5000-232868">Alien: Isolation</a> isn't a perfect Alien story, but it focuses on doing one thing incredibly well: bringing the alien to life and making it absolutely terrifying.</p><p dir="ltr">With Alien: Isolation, the focus is on moment-to-moment encounters with the creature. The game turns the final intense scenes of the original film--in which Ripley creeps around a corner, flamethrower in hand, sees the creature, and then carefully sneaks away--into the whole of the experience. It's great at this; you creep around the locales of Sevastopol station, all inspired heavily by the actual sets and concept drawings of the original film, with a single huge, unstoppable alien sneaking around in vents and stomping around corridors, searching for you.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the time in Alien: Isolation, your only means of dealing with the creature is to give it the slip, by hiding in a locker or ducking under a table, or carefully listening for and navigating around it as it does its best to find you. Every once in a while, though, the thing will sniff you out. In these moments, a gout of fire from your flamethrower might be enough to save you, and it might not.</p><p dir="ltr">If nothing else, Alien: Isolation gets the idea of just how <em>dangerous </em>the alien is. It's an intelligent hunter, using everything at its disposal to find and kill you. It will sometimes stalk around the halls looking for you, but it'll also spend its time squeezed into vents, listening and setting traps, waiting for you to stumble under an open gap so it can rip you off your feet and into darkness. Nothing can kill the alien in Isolation, and trying to shoot or fight it is mostly just an invitation for it to murder you. That makes encountering other survivors even more frightening, because if <em>they</em> start shooting at <em>you</em>, it's likely they'll get <em>everyone</em> killed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355398" data-ratio="0.56458333333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355398"></a><figcaption>Knowing that you can only ever delay the inevitable against a huge and unstoppable alien makes Alien: Isolation terrifying.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4355398-alienisolationflamethrower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You spend most of your time alone in Alien: Isolation, just you and the alien, hoping that you're out of sight or that the improvised noisemaker you just threw will be enough to distract it so you can slip away. When it isn't hunting you, Isolation's story tracks through the usual beats of an Alien story, with various characters screwing each other over for their own gain only to get their comeuppance when the creature comes calling, and those elements of the game are serviceable, but not especially exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">What Alien: Isolation creates exceedingly well, however, are those heart-pounding moments when the creature is <em>right there</em> and you're hoping you can hold your breath long enough that it won't hear you.</p><p dir="ltr">It's this feeling that every Alien movie after the original has failed to really capture. Aliens comes close--the moment in which the Colonial Marines are decimated pulls on this thread, with Hudson screaming, "They're coming out of the walls!" hitting on the idea that what's really frightening about the alien is their comfort in the shadows and their stalker's intelligence. Alien 3 attempts to capture this same vibe but struggles to provide interesting, relatable characters for the alien to chomp on. Both the prequels, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, take the idea of a scary creature and go all-out with it, with monsters that scramble toward victims and barrel through fields to bite off heads. These movies focus on the chaos of their monsters, rather than the cold, ordered precision of the xenomorph as originally conceived.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's Alien: Romulus, which excels at a lot of the things Alien: Isolation is also good at. It recaptures the essence of Alien's original set design and retro-future setting, creating the same dark, industrial kinds of locations that look both lived in and upsettingly uncomfortable for human beings--while being entirely <em>too </em>comfortable for something like the alien. Romulus understands the look of Alien and is great at resurrecting the feel of the movie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4355400" data-ratio="0.56153846153846" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4355400"></a><figcaption>Alien: Romulus and Alien: Isolation share some incredible art direction and set design that perfectly capture the world of Alien and make it unsettling and beautiful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355400-alienromulussetdesign.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But Romulus can't quite get the monsters right. It does a good job of making the facehugger more frightening as it turns it from a lurking, surprising ambusher into a fast, scuttling menace, but it does the same to the xenomorph itself. In Romulus, apart from one half-hearted attempt to use a character as bait for the others, the alien displays little interest in lying in ambush ro relying on intelligence and surprise, searching for ways to surprise the humans and ultimately carry them off to be unwilling incubators for its young. The creatures are never shadowy, instead banking on being big, slimy, and menacing.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien: Isolation also has the alien stomping around loudly and then charging straight at its prey, to be sure. But the difference is that, in Isolation, the creature is nigh unstoppable in addition to being smart and agile. The fact that you see it walking around actively looking for you makes it <em>more</em> frightening. In Romulus, though, seeing so much of the alien takes some of the bloom off the rose. Romulus's creatures are not especially huge, not especially smart, and not especially unstoppable, as the movie demonstrates toward the end when several xenos get cut down easily by Pulse Rifle fire. At that point, the most lethal thing about them becomes the splashing of their acid blood and guts on space station walls.</p><p dir="ltr">The other Alien movies are fine in their own way, each adding something different to the conversation, and that includes Alien: Romulus. Even though I'm on record as being lukewarm on the new film, it was still a pretty good time; Aliens is among my favorite movies ever, and I have some kind of love, respect, or at least awkward fascination with Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, Prometheus, and Alien: Covenant.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355402" data-ratio="0.5609375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355402"></a><figcaption>Alien: Isolation knows that the feeling of these scenes from Alien is the true terror at the heart of the franchise.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4355402-alienripley.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But while all of them have their own unique additions to the franchise, none of them has what Alien had--<em>that creature</em>, waiting amid the machinery to descend on a shocked Brett or hiding in the cramped darkness to ambush Dallas or tearing apart an overmatched Parker to get to a terrified Lambert. I'm still waiting for a movie to recapture that same monster: the one that has haunted my dreams since I first saw Alien. But at least I know that creature is waiting for me in the decrepit confines of Sevastopol whenever I boot up my PC and Alien: Isolation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ai-california-conde-journalism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another chilling week</a> for AI and journalism, with California lawmakers rolling over to Google by tacking money for AI onto a bill that attempts to stop the tech giant from hoovering up newsrooms’ money, and Conde Nast being the latest publisher to get in bed with OpenAI. The dealmakers here call this realism and opportunity, while anyone who actually cares about journalism knows it’s anything but.</p><p>Today’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225986/google-california-newsroom-deal-cjpa-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California deal</a> earmarks $250 million for newsrooms, with $180 million being distributed among outlets, and $70 million going to a “National AI Accelerator.” AI was not part of the original proposal by Oakland Assemblymember Buffy Wicks; draft language in the new proposal, first reported by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/ai-california-journalism-bill-agreement-00174678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>, cited the need to “strengthen democracy and the future of work in an Artificial Intelligence future.” The deal is the culmination of conflict over the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128363/google-cjpa-news-removal-california" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Journalism Protection Act</a>, which followed in the footsteps of bills in places like Canada and Australia that sought to make tech giants like Google and Facebook give back to the newsrooms from whom they siphon money.</p><p>There’s a kind of grim fatalism around the agreement and the supposed “Artificial Intelligence future. ” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/21/google-california-newsroom-ai-00174817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a> wrote that “Wicks sees the final agreement as the best way to get money into publishers’ hands quickly” and quotes Wicks as saying, “I think I’m dealing with the art of the possible… This represents, to me, the best case scenario for the moment we’re in. And I would rather take a nearly quarter of a billion dollar deal than nothing.” According to <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/08/california-journalism-deal-legislature-google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CalMatters</a>, Julie Makinen, board chairperson of the California News Publishers Association, said that the plan is “not what we had hoped for when set out… Sometimes, the political realities, they are what they are.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, people who work in or care about journalism are taking a more aggressive stance, with Media Guild of the West President Matt Pearce <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/21/google-california-newsroom-ai-00174817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calling</a> it “a total rout.” In a <a href="https://www.mediaguildwest.org/news/californias-journalists-do-not-consent-to-this-shakedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, the Media Guild called the deal a “shakedown” and wrote that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>After two years of advocacy for strong antimonopoly action to start turning around the decline of local newsrooms, we are left almost without words. The publishers who claim to represent our industry are celebrating an opaque deal involving taxpayer funds, a vague AI accelerator project that could very well destroy journalism jobs, and minimal financial commitments from Google to return the wealth this monopoly has stolen from our newsrooms.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>California tech journalist Brian Merchant wrote on <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1825744765477966316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> that “This bill was supposed to make big tech pay its fair share after usurping advertising from news publishers and profiting from their work—instead it’s *rewarding* their market dominance by turning journos into content trainers for AI systems.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Utterly devastating for CA journalists. This bill was supposed to make big tech pay its fair share after usurping advertising from news publishers and profiting from their work—instead it’s *rewarding* their market dominance by turning journos into content trainers for AI systems <a href="https://t.co/BI2dtTY2X0">https://t.co/BI2dtTY2X0</a></p>— Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) <a href="https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1825744765477966316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Let’s pivot for a moment: also this week, <a href="https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1825955990854053986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conde Nast</a> announced a deal with OpenAI,<a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> joining the likes</a> of Vox and The Atlantic in helping the job-stealing, content-degrading machine steal their jobs and degrade their content. Conde Nast CEO Roger Lynch wrote that the deal will&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>expand the reach of Conde Nast’s content. As we all know, generative AI is rapidly changing ways audiences are discovering information. It’s crucial that we meet audiences where they are and embrace new technologies while also ensuring proper attribution and compensation for use of our intellectual property. This is exactly what we have found with OpenAI.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>How have these deals been going so far? Well, <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/06/insider-union-chatgpt-hallucinating-links-business-insider-articles-openai-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nieman Lab</a> reported in July that Business Insider, who signed a deal with OpenAI last year, found, in the words of union members who investigated, that “OpenAI may be downplaying rather than elevating our works… Repeated efforts by unit members have been unable to prompt ChatGPT to link directly to our scoops, even when explicitly instructed to do so.” ChatGPT was linking to aggregation of stories Business Insider broke, and, when prompted to link to the outlet that first broke those stories, provided made-up Business Insider URLs instead of actual links.</p><p>An OpenAI spokesperson told Nieman Lab (emphasis mine) that “Together with our news publisher partners, we’re building an experience that blends conversational capabilities with their latest news content, <strong>ensuring proper attribution and linking to source material — an enhanced experience still in development and not yet available in ChatGPT</strong>.”</p><p>To recap: one of the supposed points of getting into bed with OpenAI is so it will surface your work, except that needs to be added to the long list of things AI can’t do yet but which you should totally trust that it will eventually do, despite the fact that it is running out of the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/ai-training-data-shortage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">power</a>, and <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/to-serve-altman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">money</a> to do anything it promises to do at all. Given all that, what <em>can</em> these deals do? As Hell Gate owner Max Rivlin-Nadler wrote on <a href="https://x.com/MaxRivlinNadler/status/1825959720756380022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, all this really amounts to is “bosses literally selling you out to make up for their own failings as executives in return for a short-term cash infusion that will certainly evaporate into their own bank accounts and leave you jobless.”</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Journalists should not just go along with this nasty nasty work, bosses literally selling you out to make up for their own failings as executives in return for a short-term cash infusion that will certainly evaporate into their own banks accounts and leave you jobless <a href="https://t.co/uleZXxncE2">https://t.co/uleZXxncE2</a></p>— Max RN (@MaxRivlinNadler) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxRivlinNadler/status/1825959720756380022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>What we see in both the California agreement and the Conde Nast deal is just propping up the tiresome trope about AI’s inevitability, a desperate response to the cash-strapped present dressed up as future-planning. I can’t believe I have to keep screaming “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Live!</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/metaverse-dead-obituary-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-tech-fad-ai-chatgpt-2023-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The metaverse</a>! <a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-brands-are-still-going-down-with-nft-s-sinking-sh-1850908321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto!</a>” every time we do one of these, a repetitive exercise that might actually be the best use of AI at this point. These deals highlight the utter disregard the people calling the shots actually have for workers and readers, how few ideas they have for ensuring a future for journalism, if that’s even a motivating factor for them beyond their own salaries and valuations.&nbsp;</p><p>I worry that in one or five or ten years, we’ll look back at this moment and regret these decisions–or, best case scenario, see them as nothing more than a bit of extra runway that led us back to the same bind we’re currently in, only with even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/05/business/ai-job-losses/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fewer jobs</a> and even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ais-climate-impact-goes-beyond-its-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotter summers</a>.

            <p>Ubisoft have announced Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era, a fresh instalment in the exceedingly olden turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series, which began life under New World Computing in 1984. The new game will “return to the world of Enroth and the origins of the legendary saga”, inviting “both veterans and new players” to go on a quest to Jadame, “a mysterious continent in turmoil”. Expect new factions, biomes and creatures, together with such M&amp;M standbys as castle management, army clashes, hex-based maps, and, who knows, maybe some heroes.</p><!--more-->

<p>The game includes a new solo campaign, the option to wage one-off clashes on single maps, and a map generator capable of “limitless” scenarios. I can fall over in “limitless” ways, Ubisoft, and I don’t go around writing press releases about it. Hmmm, maybe I should? 

</p><p>There’s also co-op and competitive multiplayer – each mode has its own matchmaking system, ratings and leaderboards – plus a map and campaign editor. It’s all glossily adorned with a revamped visual style that “harks back to the vibrant and magical beginnings of the saga”. The AI has also been overhauled, and you can expect difficulty settings designed for both those steeped in Might &amp; Magic and peasant newcomers like me, who are barely Mighty or Magical at all.</p>
<p>New mechanics include active abilities for heroes and creatures, plus a faction-based perk system, Faction Laws, for more granular sculpting of playstyles. The currently announced factions are the old school Knights of Temple, the teeming bloodsuckers and braineaters of Necropolis, the hipster faeriefolk of Sylvan, the surly dark elves and other subterranean stinkers of Dungeon, and the horrible demon bugs of Hive. There’s at least one more faction waiting to be revealed.</p>
<p>The Hive are this iteration’s big bads. “On Jadame, a continent in turmoil, rival factions must forge an uneasy and fragile alliance to face the Hive - a swarm of insectoids corrupted by a demon lord hell bent on subjugating the world,” comments the press release.</p>

<p>This will be the first Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic game to launch through early access. It runs on the Unity engine and is being developed by Unfrozen, creators of Iratus: Lord of the Dead, which was one of Sin’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-against-the-odds">Unknown Pleasures back in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Frivolous closing note: I find "Olden Era" quite funny inasmuch as they could have subtitled it "Old Era", but that would have just made the game sound old, even though "old" is modern usage, while "olden" is an archaism. Language is a delightful beast. Perhaps this is the next conversational fallback position for people who insist that they're "middle-aged", even after they turn 60? I'm not old, you cheeky whippersnappers, I'm olden! If you're over 60, feel free to split that hair when you're next talking to a grandchild or medical professional.</p>

In 2024, it’s closer to $127,000, based on sponsorship rates viewed by <em>Kotaku</em>.

Still, even the standard Gamescom price is way more than most developers can afford to get their game out into the ether and breaking through the rest of the Gamescom trailer blitz. </p><p>While Gamescom Opening Night Live had two hours of announcements, updates, and other glimpses of upcoming games, in addition to the ongoing torrent of other news coming out of the weeklong fan expo, a bunch of indie devs have been trying to get eyeballs on their work simply by tweeting it out with the now viral refrain, “Gamescom trailer is more than 100k dollars, so here is a GIF.” </p><p><em>Mullet Madjack</em> maker HAMMER95, whose <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">excellent boomer shooter</a></span> came out back in May, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Hammer95studios/status/1825982312477241761/history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Hammer95studios/status/1825982312477241761/history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicked things off</a></span> during the Gamescom livestream on Tuesday, but it wasn’t long before tons of other devs joined in with eye-watering GIFs teasing their upcoming projects.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/an-update-on-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is already one of the most successful video games of the year, breaking records and soaring up player charts. On PlayStation 5 and PC, players have been enjoying it with reviews praising the game. However, one segment of players haven’t been able to play Black Myth: Wukong at all, Xbox owners.</p>



<p>Now, of course they can play it if they have a PC or PS5 as well, but for those that just have either an Xbox Series X or S, the game still isn’t available. So what’s going on with it?</p>



<h2 id="h-the-latest-on-black-myth-wukong-on-xbox">The Latest On Black Myth: Wukong On Xbox</h2>



<p>The game was originally scheduled to release on the consoles alongside the PC and PlayStation before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was revealed in June</a> to not be coming at the same time. Then, later that month, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued a statement</a> on the game’s delay on the console, saying that they were “excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms”.</p>



<p>And now that the game is out, there’s a bit of an update as to what’s going on. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/20/whens-xboxs-black-myth-wukong-release-date-about-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes’ Paul Tassi</a>, Black Myth: Wukong not being on Xbox isn’t a case of Sony snatching up any sort of console exclusive agreement with developer Game Science. Instead, it’s Microsoft’s own consoles and their policies causing the hiccups.</p>



<p>“The bad news is that once again, Xbox seems to have blundered into a Baldur’s Gate 3 situation…,” Tassi says.</p>



<p>Tassi says that the reason the game didn’t make it to Xbox at launch is because of a “tech issue”. While the specific issue isn’t mentioned in the report, it does seem to imply that the game isn’t running on Xbox Series S as well as it should. Microsoft’s policy since the console’s launch of games coming to both Xbox Series X and S seems to have backfired once again.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft on this claim, but a rep simply passed along the same statement from June that was also sent to Tassi. You can read that in full below:</p>



<p>“We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” the statement reads. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</p>

Development on Infinity Nikki is being led by The Legend of Zelda expansion pass director Kentaro Tominaga, and the game bills itself as a cozy open-world adventure with puzzles to solve and secret areas to discover. The main draw of Infinity Nikki is that you'll be able to equip different outfits on the protagonist Nikki to help her access new abilities, and the game has a charming anime-influenced art direction.</p><p>There's no concrete release date for it yet, but Infinity Nikki will launch for PC, PS5, iOS, and Android.</p>

            <p>If you've been necromantically dreaming of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> sequel, I'm afraid the monkey paw finger hasn't just curled - it's jammed itself right up your nose and scratched an FU on your hypothalamus. Developers Striking Distance and publishers Krafton have revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a>, a scifi roguelike dungeon crawler set in the same universe.</p>
<p>The square brackets are part of the title, yes, and they're also calling it "punk rock" - a combination of factors that fills me with a rage so obliterating, I can barely perceive the announcement trailer, below. It's a machinegun montage of comicbook panels and sizzling melee arcs and quips like "there's a lot of wankers between you and the sweet taste of freedom". I didn't even like The Callisto Protocol that much but still, what have they done to you, boy? Where did all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game go?</p><!--more-->

<p>In [REDACTED], you are a lone security guard trying to make it out of Black Iron Prison, the original game's Jovian correctional facility. In The Callisto Protocol, you slithered and skulked through crammed and shadowy corridors, fending off squamous mutant convicts in a passable facsimile of Dead Space. In [REDACTED], you beast hordes of colourful monsters in frenetic Hades-style arena brawls. There are skills to upgrade, metas to finesse, "experiments" (mods, I guess?) to equip, weapons and suits to loot.</p>
<p>"This game is all about fighting, dying, dying again, dying some more, and adapting, taking the classic roguelike formula and cranking it to eleven," bellows the press release, because nothing says "punk rock" like unironically quoting a piece of mockumentary dialogue that was originally intended as a gag about the meaninglessness of rising numbers. At the very least, I'd like video games to start cranking it to 12. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>I'm probably being too mean. Or at least, I'm venting too much at the press release, and not saying enough about the game. Forgive the Poochie The Dog presentation and judge it purely as a genre piece with no Callisto affiliations, and [REDACTED] seems performant enough. The visuals are very Void Bastardy and hey, the melee combat certainly looks more entertaining than that of The Callisto Protocol, which admittedly is a bit like saying that running a cheesegrater over your face is more fun than sitting on a blowtorch. The game has at least one clever idea, though I don't think it's unique to [REDACTED]: when you die, your corpse revives as an enemy equipped with all the gear and upgrades you were carrying.</p>
<p>Each run is an exercise in crafting a bossfight, in other words, and I do wonder how that might affect your tactics deeper in: if you confident you're going to cop it, should you throw away all of your potent gear to make life easier for your successor? Aside from your own reanimated flesh, the game also features other human survivors locked in the same race for the very last prison escape pod. They'll either try to kill you directly or throw "unexpected challenges" into your path. Typical geezer shenanigans. When will they learn.</p>
<p>[REDACTED] is out 31st October.
