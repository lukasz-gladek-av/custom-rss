<p>In a fresh report from NewZoo, it has been confirmed that ARC Raiders skyrocketed within just two days on the market, beating many of the world’s most capable and impactful games in October’s revenue charts. The data revealed that ARC Raiders secured the seventh spot in the charts in October, despite being released on October 30.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be one of the most transformative games ever released, taking over the extraction shooter genre and retaining an enormous player base almost a month after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-on-top-almost">ARC Raiders On Top (Almost)</h2>



<p>In an all-new October revenue report from NewZoo, it was documented that ARC Raiders hit the seventh spot in the charts despite being on the shelves for just two days in October.</p>



<p>It effortlessly walked over some of the biggest games in the business:</p>



<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>



<li>Call of Duty</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>VALORANT</li>



<li>ROBLOX</li>



<li>World of Warcraft</li>



<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>



<p>The stunning achievement sat ARC Raiders behind the likes of NBA 2K26, Fortnite, Ghost of Yotei, and Battlefield 6, all of which is/were to be expected.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun gamers worldwide, and everyone from diehard extraction shooter fans to those totally new to the concept is getting on board. Recently, a streamer-backed initiative saw some of the biggest creators in the space take part in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-war-bungulators-arc-battle/">unofficial ‘war’</a> that pulled unprecedented audiences into some streamers’ chats.</p>



<p>There’s a hefty roadmap in store for ARC Raiders, and Embark Studios, the game’s stellar creator, has vowed to support the title for years to come. The next major update will be <strong>Cold Snap</strong>, coming in December 2025.</p>

            <p>Veteran actor Udo Kier has passed away. He was 81.</p>
<p>Kier was born Udo Kierspe in Cologne, Germany. When he was 18, he moved to London, before going on to star in films including Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Armageddon and Blade.</p>
<p>The news of his passing was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a>, artist Delbert McBride. Along with his film credits, Kier also starred in a number of games, including as Yuri in the Command and Conquer: Red Alert series. The actor was also due to star in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Kier's passing, Kojima said he was "at a loss for words".</p>
<p>"It all happened far too suddenly," <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409">Kojima wrote on social media</a>. "Because of the strike, we weren't able to shoot 'OD' for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual 'Udo-isms'.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe this.</p>
<p>"Udo wasn't just an actor. He was truly an 'icon' of his time. We've lost a great 'icon'. There will never be another like him.</p>
<p>"Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you."</p>

<p>Along with Kier, Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer and director Jordan Peele - who is known for his films Get Out and Nope - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-and-xbox-team-up-to-show-off-more-od-knock">are also connected to Kojima's OD</a>. At the time of writing, it's unknown if Kier will be recast or if his role will be removed from the project.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Udo, and thank you for all you've done.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ferocious-indie-fps-where-you-fight-dinosaurs-but-also-control-them/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ferocious-is-an-indie-single-player-fps-where-you-fight-dinosaurs-but-also-control-them-and-it%E2%80%99s-out-on-december-4.1362526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher tinyBuild has announced that the indie single player first-person shooter game FEROCIOUS will be released on December 4 for PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/?mc_cid=5e1f5669c5&amp;mc_eid=728a334a9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>FEROCIOUS, powered by Unity, is the debut game of OMYOG, a small studio that features the expertise of both AAA game and film veterans. Leonard Saalfrank, inspired by King Kong, leads the vision, while Mark, ex-Far Cry and Battlefront II director, brings sandbox-level design expertise. Writers like Jörg Ihle and Dominik Hochwald add narrative depth from film, games, and theme parks.</p>



<p>In FEROCIOUS, players will find themselves stranded on a dangerous island and forced to survive against mercenaries, dinosaurs, and a vibrant yet hostile ecosystem. At every turn, they must face challenges in the form of savage predators, treacherous terrain, and limited resources. Careful exploration is vital to uncover hidden paths, secrets and essential gear. Furthermore, as shown in the release date trailer (embedded below), there's a twist in that a so-called 'dino control device' lets you turn the dinosaurs to your side, so that they might be used to attack enemies, open paths, or infiltrate guarded areas. </p>



<p>The lore explanation is that it scans the creature's brain and reproduces its vocal signals, not unlike what was shown in Jurassic Park 3, but with the usage of ultrasonic calls that only the lizards can hear. Once scanned, the player can get a dinosaur to follow them, move to a particular spot, attack a target, break obstacles, or even fetch items. The commands depend on the species; some are more obedient (or smarter) than others. Not every dinosaur in the game will be controllable, though.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>TinyBuild did not share the pricing yet, but given that it's an indie game, we expect it to be priced accordingly. The Steam page also includes the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for FEROCIOUS, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i5 4th Gen or AMD equivalent<br>Memory: 12 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>Recommended:<br></strong>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br>OS: Windows 10/11 64-bit<br>Processor: Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5 3600 and up<br>Memory: 16 GB RAM<br>Graphics: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD RX 5600<br>DirectX: Version 11<br>Storage: 25 GB available space</p>

            <p>November is... merry! As the great grim centipede of people and property that is Videogaming continues its progress of the midnight wood, a dozen auteur designers from theatre backgrounds don coxcomb hats and sequined codpieces. They climb onto carts and stage a chariot race, beating each other with bladders decorated to look like Roger Ebert. There is laughter up and down the train. Meanwhile, the industry seers and marketing-mancers have received hopeful tidings from their friends among the owls and bats. The trees are thinning out ahead. The stars can sometimes be seen. There is wild talk that third-person cover shooters are about to come back into fashion.</p>
<p>That isn't all the owls and bats have seen, however. As the path curves, we find ourselves in the courtyard of a squat and forbidding tower. Five levels of blood-flecked obsidian and pixelated braziers, each named for a day of the week, each infested by perfectly terrifying new PC games. Never mind that the edifice has clearly been slapped together using assets lifted from a webinar. Never mind that you can see fuchsia checkerboards everywhere. The tower's frightful denizens must be defeated - or possibly even bought - if the convoy is to proceed.</p><!--more-->

<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725250/Nientum__OpZERO/">Nientum - Op.ZERO</a> (early access) is a mix of 2D platforming and rhythm-action in which amnesiac anime girls restore a creepy theatre and perform twisted versions of familiar musicals.</li>

<li>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2695430/AILA/">A.I.L.A</a> you are a games tester contending with a villainous AI level designer (think Portal, not ChatGPT), rather than the more familiar problems of precarity and crunch.</li>

I get the sense that even the nice-sounding worlds will be dreadful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tower is soon afire, for in these strange and glitchy times even obsidian may burn. Our gimlet-eyed QA staff chase the surviving games into the woods; they will haunt us for months to come, stealthily adding themselves to our wishlists while we huddle in our wagons, blowing into frosty fingers and dreaming of the brighter tomorrow promised by the soothsayers. Perhaps the Second Coming is at hand! Perhaps another 2.0 update is at hand!</p>

                <p>2025 has seen a surprising number of fun arcade racing games, including the recent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which landed on PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC back in September. And for a limited time during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>, you can get the Amazon Exclusive Edition for just $45 (was $60). That's the lowest price we've seen since launch, and it applies to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8R7QS54?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8RCDNH5?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8RBYYNM?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> versions of the game. This deal will only stick around during Black Friday, however, and because it's the first real discount we've seen for the game, it's a good idea to pick it up now if it's on your wishlist.</p><div title="6536095 - Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Black Friday Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4933" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536095 - Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Black Friday Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Amazon Exclusive Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$45 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds features 24 tracks, 23 playable characters, and 45 customizable vehicles to try out.

The game also features quality-of-life improvements and a redesigned interface that refines the experience while preserving the heart of the cult-classic PS2 original.</p><p>Note that the Switch 2 version of the game comes on a Game Key-Card, which means none of the game data is included on the cart. Instead, inserting the physical game into your system unlocks the digital version, which you must download to your console before you can start playing. Expect Persona 3 Reload to take up about 25GB on your Switch 2's internal storage or SD card. It's also worth pointing out is that the Episode Aigis DLC expansion is available a separate $35 purchase on the Switch 2 eShop. Episode Aegis adds roughly 30 hours of new story content that takes place after the base game's ending, along with new costumes and music.</p></div>                      </div><p>While Persona 3 Reload came to Switch 2 just a few months ago, it originally launched on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, and PC back in early 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a data mine from the Invincible VS Closed Alpha, a controversial character is set to join the roster. Furthermore, it seems the character may be the next one announced.</p>







<p>Based on the comic series and animated show, Invincible is a more bloody version of superheroes. Think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-boys-operators-for-call-of-duty-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Boys</a>, but more on the mature and dramatic side. The Prime Video show has been going strong for three seasons, with the fourth coming in March 2026. Many game adaptations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skybound-games-announces-new-invincible-universe-game-within-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been made</a>, but Invincible VS gives the fans what they’ve wanted: a good old-fashioned fighting game. </p>



<p>Announced earlier this year, the game, which comes from former Killer Instinct developers, looks to be the ultimate Invincible experience, down to the show’s all-star cast (like The Walking Dead’s Steven Yeun and Whiplash’s JK Simmons) returning. Now, it seems a new character has been prematurely revealed, and it’s one that comic book fans will be taken aback by.</p>

<p>The news comes from Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p53a5b/invincible_vs_closed_alpha_test_accidentally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RIPMrMufasi</a>, who posted on /GamingLeaksandRumours about the Invincible VS Closed Alpha. The test, which started on November 21st, has been going fairly well. As was the case with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-demo-data-mine-heroes-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, it doesn’t stop fans from doing a data mine into the files and seeing if anything unannounced is in it. As expected, there was indeed something: <strong>a character available through a model swap bug</strong>, seen in the video <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/bada-bing-VLST6Nh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>



<p>According to the video from the Invincible VS data mine, <strong>the character looks to be Anissa</strong>. In the show, the Viltrumite warrior is played by Shantel VanSanten (One Tree Hill, The Boys). The character, seen as an antagonist in the show, is <strong>a rather controversial choice</strong>. While not adapted into the show yet, an inappropriate moment in the comics between her and Mark, the protagonist, has made many worried about her inclusion. </p>



<p>As of now, the character has not been confirmed by Skybound Games or Quarter Up, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. For fans of the show, the character is a welcome addition to the roster. However, to fans of the comics, it’s one that may stir up some controversy. Either way, if true, it won’t be long until it’s official.</p>







<p>What do you think of Anissa possibly being added to Invincible VS’ roster? Think it’s a controversial pick? Will it become a problem soon? Which Invincible character would you like to see in the game?

<p>Udo Kier, one of the stars in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-overdose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kojima Productions’ upcoming OD</a>, has passed away. The German actor, 81, had starred in many films and shows, as well as Call of Duty: WWII.</p>







<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the actor’s partner, Delbert McBride, confirmed the news to Variety. He passed away on Sunday morning. As of writing, there has been no comment in regards to the cause of death.</p>

<p>Udo Kier has starred in well over 200 films, starting in 1966 on the TV show Road to Saint Tropez. His frequent collaborations with iconic artist Andy Warhol and the vampire film genre made him a familiar face for fans. In the 90s, Kier appeared in films like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Blade, and Johnny Mnemonic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s appeared in several video game adaptations like Far Cry and BloodRayne. However, he’s also shown up in games over the span of his career. Often military, Udo Kier played the role of Yuri in Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Yuri’s Revenge. Furthermore, he played Dr. Peter Staub in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-wwii-available-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: WWII</a> and Erich in Martha is Dead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the actor’s future projects is OD, Hideo Kojima’s next big horror project for Kojima Productions. Unfortunately, it seems Udo Kier did not finish filming for the project, as Kojima <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted about his passing</a>, saying filming was set to start next Spring. The actor was announced alongside Hunter Schafer and Sophia Lillis at the 2023 Game Awards. A teaser for the Xbox Game Studios’ title was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a>. It’s unknown if the actor will be recast or scrapped from the project at this time.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and his partner during this difficult time.</p>

These are all Gen 1 models--so they won't have the extended battery life or upgraded cameras of the Gen 2 models--but they still offer many of the same features as the newer models, including Meta AI support, built-in speakers and camera, and more. While the smart glasses are available in a variety of frames and lens styles, it looks like only the Wayfarer frames are currently getting discounts. You can snag a pair for as low as $239.20 (normally $299) thanks to Amazon's sale.</p><div title="6536164 - Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses deal (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5098" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536164 - Meta Ray-Ban AI glasses deal (BF2025)" data-collection="{&quot;collection&quot;:[]}">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Ray-Ban X Meta Smart Glasses - Wayfarer Frames (Gen 1)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CGXYNWBH,B0CL6J164F,B0CGXX2HG5,B0DDCLXN5H&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Starts at $239</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you're unfamiliar with Meta's collaboration with Ray-Ban, these smart glasses aren't your average pair of frames.

The frames are only slightly thicker than those of some typical glasses, so unless someone is looking closely, most won't even realize you have a computer sitting on your head. </p><p>As for the actual specs, you'll find an ultra-wide 12MP camera, a five-mic system for easy voice recognition, an included charging and travel case, and a built-in button to activate its AI.

Amazon has two deals available--the first drops the Mea Quest 3S 128GB model to just $250 (was $300) and includes a $50 Amazon gift card as a free bonus. You can also score the Meta Quest 3S bundle that includes the 256GB model of the headset with a copy of Batman: Arkham Shadow and a $49 Amazon Gift Card for just $329 (was $400). These deals are exclusive to Amazon and won't stick around long, so grab them while you can.</p><h2>Meta Quest 3S VR Headset Black Friday Deals</h2><p>The Quest 3S is much bigger than the Ray-Ban AI Smart Glasses, but they're also much more powerful, acting as a complete standalone, wireless VR setup (though you can also plug the headset into your PC or PS5 if you want to play more demanding VR games). If you've been curious about VR gaming but haven't jumped in yet, these bundles are an excellent way to get an affordable VR setup.</p><p>For more VR and gaming deals, head over to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">GameSpot's Black Friday 2025 hub</a>.</p><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-ps5-pro-deal-in-six-months-is-up-for-grabs-for-a-limited-time/1100-6526406/">The First PS5 Pro Deal In Six Months Is Up For Grabs For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-ps5-slim-bundles-and-collectors-edition-get-huge-discounts/1100-6534326/">Ghost Of Yotei PS5 Slim Bundles And Collector's Edition Get Huge Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/">Save Big On 8BitDo's Stellar Ultimate 2 Controllers In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-exp-r-tomb-raider-cartridge-bundle-retro-gaming-amazon-black-friday-deals/1100-6534530/">Evercade Retro Handhelds &amp; Cartridges Get Rare Price Cuts In Amazon's Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/">Kirby Air Riders Buying Guide: Release-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-vr-headset-best-black-friday-deals/1100-6532962/">Meta Quest 3S Black Friday Deal - Save Up To $70 And Get $50 Amazon Credit</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-gamecube-third-party-controller-switch-2-pc-amazon-holiday-deal/1100-6532458/">Grab A Wireless GameCube-Style Controller For Switch 1/2 &amp; PC For Only $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Games typically run well from a microSD card on SteamOS, and the Z2 chip paired with Radeon graphics can handle a wide range of titles.</p><p>The handheld measures 11.75 x 1.71 x 5.02 inches, and it

<p>Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/">HP laptop to an all-time low of $859 for Black Friday, down from its usual $2,999 price tag</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>13th Gen Intel 10-core i5 processor, 17.3-inch Full HD display, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD storage</strong>. Windows 11 Pro comes preloaded with Copilot AI, and HP includes a backlit keyboard plus fingerprint reader for security.</p>

<h2>10-Core Intel Power That Handles Real Work</h2>
<p>The 13th Generation Intel Core i5-1334U processor has <strong>10 cores that turbo boost up to 4.6GHz if you need that extra horsepower</strong>. The hybrid architecture splits the cores between performance and efficiency, throwing the heavy lifting of demanding tasks to powerful cores while background processes run on efficient cores. You can open multiple Chrome tabs, Microsoft Office applications, video conferencing software, and photo editing programs all at once without any lag.</p>
<p>The 32GB DDR4 RAM removes memory bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, switch between heavy applications, and work with large datasets without seeing the dreaded spinning wheel. Virtual machines run smoothly for developers or IT professionals who need to test software across different environments.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides read speeds to make the entire system snappy</strong> and responsive. It boots up Windows in seconds, launches applications almost instantly, and complete file transfers in no time. The storage capacity holds an entire work library of documents, presentations, spreadsheets, photos, videos, and software installations without the constant management of the drive.</p>
<p>The<strong> 17.3-inch Full HD display provides serious screen real estate at 1920×1080 resolution</strong>.

You unlock the laptop with a quick touch of your finger, jumping right into work without delays in authentication. The fingerprint data remains stored locally on the device rather than in cloud databases.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 gives you faster wireless speeds</strong> and greater performance in crowded networks than ever before. Fast transfer of bulky files, smooth video streaming, and jitter-free video conferencing are now possible. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3</strong> connects your wireless mouse, keyboard, headphones, and other accessories with greater range and reliability. USB Type-A and Type-C ports support existing peripherals and accessories along with newer ones without the need for dongles.</p>

Integration with Copilot AI will help users brainstorm ideas, organize tasks, create drafts of content, and answer questions directly in Windows. The AI assistant simplifies your workflow by automating routine tasks for you and displaying relevant suggested actions based on how you work.</p>

This includes hidden Chao across each level, a chance to play pinball in the Casino Nights zone, and a museum featuring all sorts of behind-the-scenes material.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sonic X Shadow Generations Deals At Amazon</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6JYR4M7?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6J5Q94Y?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6JKTRHP?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F663CWT8?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic X Shadow Generations review</a> called it a "nice enough trip down memory lane," though it does come with some friction due to the age of Sonic Generations. If you're a Sonic fan, you'll probably find something here of value (especially at $25). "Shadow Generations' story is a great opportunity to revisit some of Shadow's most memorable moments as well as past boss battles against other artificial beings that could be considered rivals to the title of "ultimate life form," like the Biolizard from Sonic Adventure 2," wrote critic Jordan Ramée. "I was grinning like a kid again when Shadow faced off against Metal Overlord and Crush 40's "What I'm Made Of..." started playing, reminding me of the hours I lost to Sonic Heroes when I was 10 years old."</p><p>Many other <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F8RBYYNM,B0F8R7QS54,B0F8RCDNH5,B08GHH697V,B0D6JKTRHP,B0F663CWT8,B0D6JYR4M7,B0D6J5Q94Y,B0BB13V163,B0BB1BDM72,B0B9ZFWMK1,B0B9ZTTCJG,B0BZFGSY5W,B0BZFKBL8L,B0BZFCRLDW,B0BZFQ6SLQ,B0C91MLPNG,B0C8ZW6391,B0C915HKTK,B0C9164THC&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic games are on sale for Black Friday</a>, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9ZFWMK1?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which is down to $18 on PS5, $16 on PS4, $10 on Xbox Series X, and $25 on Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock holds the same premium position in robot vacuums that Dyson commands in traditional vacuums, with flagship models regularly exceeding $1,500 to $2,000. These luxury cleaning machines pack technology that separates them from budget competitors flooding the market.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon just dropped one of Roborock’s best-sellers<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/"> to an all-time low of $849 for Black Friday, nearly half off from its usual $1,499 price tag</a>. The <strong>Qrevo CurvX</strong> delivers 22,000Pa suction, zero-tangling design, reactive AI obstacle recognition and 80°C hot water mop washing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The<strong> 22,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> creates enough force to pull deeply embedded dirt from carpet pile and pulls debris from gaps in hardwood flooring. You can immediately tell the difference compared with a vacuum that has only 8,000-10,000Pa-suction power and tends to push dust instead of picking it up. Pet hair, long human hair up to 40cm, cereal crumbs, and tracked-in dirt-all get pulled into the dustbin in one pass. The zero-tangling design stops hair from tangling around the brushes, thus doing away with the maintenance nightmare of standard robot vacuums where you end up spending 15 minutes each week cutting tangled hair off rollers.</p>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim profile, at only 3.14 inches, makes this the thinnest Roborock ever</strong> manufactured-just 7.98cm tall. This reduced height lets the robot glide under sofas, beds, and cabinets where dust bunnies really collect. Traditional robot vacuums with raised LiDAR domes get stuck or completely skip whole sections below furniture. This Roborock reaches those forgotten spaces and captures hidden dirt that ruins air quality even when visible floors appear clean.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle recognition relies on structured light and an RGB camera to detect and avoid 108 different object types. It <strong>works both in bright and dark environments</strong> and navigates around toys, cables, pet bowls, shoes, and even furniture legs without getting stuck. You don’t have to preclean your floors before running the vacuum, which really changes the vacuum from a scheduled maintenance tool into something you can turn on spontaneously.</p>
<p>AdaptiLift Chassis is industry-first technology that <strong>can lift the entire robot up to 4cm or individually according to terrain</strong>. The system raises the front to climb high thresholds, adjusts side wheels to navigate around furniture legs, and lowers for tight clearances. This adaptability prevents the ‘stuck’ notifications which interrupt other robot vacuums in mid-clean.</p>
<p>The 80°C hot water washing of the mop dissolves stubborn stains and grease left by cold water. The dock heats water to 176°F before washing the mop pads to make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use. Warm air drying at 113°F prevents mildew and odors from forming on damp mop pads. This focus on hygiene means your robot will never spread dirty water around on your floors in the course of subsequent cleaning.</p>



<p>The automated maintenance tasks handled by the<strong> Multifunctional Dock 3.0 Thermo+ mean you barely touch the robot</strong>. Auto dust emptying transfers collected debris to the dock’s larger bag, holding weeks of dirt. Auto tank refilling keeps the water reservoir full for mopping sessions. Intelligent dirt detection analyzes mop pad contamination and adjusts washing intensity accordingly. The dock performs self-cleaning with hot water, preventing the buildup that makes other docking stations smell terrible after a few weeks.</p>
<p>At $849, this Roborock delivers flagship cleaning technology and hot water mop washing for $650 off the usual price. You are getting premium features that normally would call for an outlay in excess of $1,500+, skimping on very few minor conveniences.</p>

"The game aims for accessibility at every opportunity, and while nothing about it is particularly exceptional, it still has plenty of unique flourishes to offer, and the wealth of different events and simple controls make for an appealing casual multiplayer title. Thanks to a generous selection of events and a few neat gimmicks, Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is the best entry in this series."</p><p>Amazon is discounting several other Switch exclusives for Black Friday 2025, including hits like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, but the deals are selling out quickly.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-solix-makes-ecoflow-and-jackery-look-overpriced-2-000w-power-station-selling-for-pocket-change.1362409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While EcoFlow, Anker and Jackery were all fairly aggressive in their Black Friday pricing on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">only Anker provides 2,000W output at $349</a>. Competitor power stations in the $350-$400 price range top out at 1,500-1,800W which gets you less power for similar money.</p>
<p>Amazon has just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">Anker SOLIX C1000 (second gen) to an all-time low of $349, down from its usual $449 price tag</a>. You get <strong>2,000W continuous output with 3,000W surge capacity</strong>, a 1,024Wh LiFePO4 battery lasting 10 years and it can recharge fully in just 49 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2,000W Output Powers What You Need</h2>
<p>The 2,000W continuous output handles high-draw appliances that kill weaker power stations instantly. You can<strong> power up space heaters, window air conditioners, power tools, electric kettles, and other demanding devices</strong> without triggering overload shutdowns. The 3,000W surge capacity absorbs the startup power spikes that motors and compressors create when they first kick on. Refrigerators, well pumps, and air compressors all draw massive current for a few seconds during startup, and this power station handles those surges without flinching.</p>
<p><strong>Ten output ports</strong> spread the power across various devices at once, without having to prioritize what charges first. The port selection <strong>includes AC outlets</strong> for the standard household devices, <strong>USB-C with fast charging for phones and laptops, USB-A for the older gear</strong>&nbsp;and a car outlet for the 12V accessories. You can power a full remote work setup with laptop, monitor, router, and phone charger while running a mini fridge and fan during power outages.</p>



<p>The <strong>49-minute recharge time using HyperFlash technology at 1,600W input</strong> redefines how you use portable power stations. The traditional models take 6-10 hours to recharge from empty, creating overnight charging rituals which make the power station unavailable when you need it. This Anker charges over a lunch break or during a quick stop at an RV park and is ready for another full day of heavy use. You enable HyperFlash mode through the Anker app when you need maximum charging speed, or use standard charging for quieter operation.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry<strong> offers 10 years of reliable performance with 4,000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity drops to 80%. Traditional lithium-ion batteries degrade much faster; many lose a large portion of their capacity after 500-1,000 cycles. The longevity transforms this from a disposable gadget into a legitimate long-term investment that keeps working through years of regular use. The battery is much safer while charging and discharging than a standard lithium battery due to a lower risk of fire and higher thermal stability.</p>



<p>UPS functionality with<strong> under 10-millisecond switchover</strong> keeps sensitive equipment running during power transitions. CPAP machines, computers, modems, and medical devices never experience interruption when grid power fails. The power station detects outages and seamlessly takes over power delivery before the connected devices even notice anything happened.</p>
<p>At 14% smaller and 11% lighter than other 1,000Wh class products on the market, this compact unit makes transport and storage easier. You can also move it between rooms, load it into vehicles for camping, or stash it in closets without excessive effort.</p>
<p>This $349, 2,000W power station offers more output capacity and 49-minute recharging, while its usual price is $100 lower than the normal. Other competitors charge similar prices for less powerful 1,500-1,800W models with slower charging.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonos-offloads-era-300-at-zero-margin-dolby-atmos-rival-to-devialet-hits-pocket-change-pricing.1362397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos made its name with speakers that promise high-quality sound without the complexity of a traditional hi-fi system. The Era 300 is its most ambitious speaker yet, <strong>using spatial audio technology to create sound that moves around you</strong> rather than just blasting from one direction.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/">dropped it to an all-time low of $379 for Black Friday, down from its usual $479 price tag</a>. You get six strategically positioned drivers that support Dolby Atmos Music and create <strong>wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling sound projection</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Six Drivers That Create Dimensional Sound</h2>
<p>Placement of Era 300 drivers on the front, sides and top projects sound in multiple directions at once. This configuration serves as the sonic environment Dolby Atmos content needs to operate. Instruments and vocals are placed in locations around your listening space. You hear guitar riffs coming from your left, vocals centered in front, and ambient effects floating overhead.</p>
<p>Custom waveguides tailor the sound dispersion of each driver to make sure you get audio coming from the correct right, left, forward, and above positions. The waveguides serve as acoustic lenses, focusing sound with directional control. You get a wide stereo soundstage that immerses the whole room, instead of a narrow sweet spot where everything sounds good. You can walk around the room without killing the effect, unlike what happens with traditional stereo speakers that only sound right when you’re seated perfectly centered.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos Music leverages these spatial capabilities</strong> when you stream compatible content from services like Apple Music and Amazon Music. Artists and producers mix Atmos tracks with height and surround channels, placing different elements in a three-dimensional sound field. Listening to Atmos mixes reveals details and separations you never noticed in stereo versions. Drum fills circle around you, backup vocals float distinct from lead vocals, and instrumental layers occupy their own space rather than competing for attention.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi streaming provides stable, high-quality audio</strong> from all major music services, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens more. The Sonos app controls everything: You can browse catalogs, create queues, and manage multiple speakers throughout your home. Bluetooth pairing adds flexibility for devices or services that work better with direct connections. The Sonos Line-In Adapter lets you connect turntables or other audio sources, bringing analog gear into your wireless system.</p>



<p>Regular software updates mean that features and integrations are added over time and keep the speaker current as the streaming landscape evolves. Sonos has a great track record of supporting older products with updates years after you’ve bought them. Updates happen automatically in the background without any need for manual intervention or compatibility concerns.</p>
<p>The speaker <strong>works as a standalone device or incorporates with bigger Sonos systems</strong> across several rooms. You can group speakers together for synchronized music playback throughout your home or control each independently to have different audio in every space. The system scales from a single speaker up to whole-home audio, with no complicated wiring or technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $379, this spatial audio speaker delivers Dolby Atmos Music and multi-directional sound for $100 off its usual price. You’re getting Sonos build quality and future software support at a price that makes experimenting with spatial audio reasonable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free-2000646730</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10-000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free.1362391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap power banks die after a few months or charge so slowly you’re still stuck glued to walls for several hours. The Anker <em>Zolo</em> power bank provides<strong> legitimate 30W fast charging to rival wall outlets</strong>, yet still brings the same durability Anker has built a name on. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $19 for Black Friday, down from the usual $25</a>.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>10,000mAh capacity good for two full iPhone charges</strong>, a baked-in USB-C cable tested for 10,000 bends and bidirectional charging that tops up the power bank itself in reasonable time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>30W Charging That Matches Your Wall Charger</h2>
<p>The <strong>output of 30W gives double the charging speed of the conventional power banks</strong>-5V/3A-that crawl at 15W. Your iPhone 16 Pro Max hits 50% in just 27 minutes, matching what you’d get from plugging into a wall outlet with Apple’s fast charger. Conventional power banks take more than an hour to reach the same charge level, which makes using them an exercise in frustration for a quick top-up between meetings or during short breaks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000mAh capacity will yield nearly two full charges for an iPhone 17</strong>, 1.94 charges for a Samsung Galaxy S25, and two full charges for an iPhone 14 Pro before recharging the power bank. You should be able to make it through long days of traveling, outdoor activities, or power outages without feeling anxious that your phone is going to die on you. The capacity also delivers about 10 full charges for the AirPods Pro 3 and keeps your earbuds powered for weeks of commutes.</p>



<p>Eliminate the frustration of forgetting charging cables at home or digging through bags to find them <strong>with the 5.4-inch-long built-in USB-C cable</strong>. It’s attached to the power bank and is ready whenever you need it. <strong>Anker tested this cable through 10,000 bend cycles</strong> and they ensure the cable survives wrapping, twisting, or stuffing into a pocket thousands of times.</p>
<p><strong>Bidirectional 30W charging</strong> means the power bank recharges quickly through the same USB-C port it uses to charge your devices. The 20W input fills the battery much faster than older power banks that take six hours to recharge from empty. You can top up the power bank during lunch breaks or short charging windows rather than leaving it plugged in overnight. The convenience of fast recharging makes the power bank practical for daily use rather than something you charge once weekly.</p>
<p>The<strong> compact 4.32 x 2.58 x 0.98-inch dimensions</strong> slip easily into pockets, purses, or laptop bags without creating noticeable bulk. The power bank weighs less than your phone, making it comfortable to carry on any commute or travel.</p>



<p><strong>Additional USB-C and USB-A ports</strong> allow you to charge multiple devices at the same time using your own cables. The USB-A port remains compatible with older devices and accessories that haven’t transitioned over to USB-C. You can also charge your phone via the built-in cable while powering earbuds or a smartwatch through the extra ports. This multi-device capability proves useful when traveling with a lot of gadgets.</p>
<p>Anker backs the power bank <strong>with an 18-month warranty</strong> to cover defects and performance issues. The company’s customer service responds rapidly to problems, normally replacing faulty units with minimal hassle. This value-added support comes into play well beyond the price paid, since you are covered when problems crop up.</p>
<p>At $19, this 10,000mAh power bank offers 30W fast charging with a rugged built-in cable for well below the competition, which usually carries worse specs at higher prices.</p>

<p>So, if you happen to be located in the US and have a store nearby with one of these Switch 2 kiosks, you may want to head over and check it out. Nintendo hasn't announced an eShop demo for this title, so a store visit is currently the only way to get a sample of the action right now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mac-mini-has-a-budget-twin-now-512gb-mini-pc-selling-for-pennies-that-makes-apple-look-greedy.1362376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs solve the desktop dilemma where full-sized towers waste space and energy while delivering more power than most people actually need. The <em>Kamrui GK3Plus</em> puts a complete Windows computer inside a 5.1-inch cube that fits behind monitors or tucks into entertainment centers.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped it to $189, and with the<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/"> exclusive Prime promotion code 47DA9QPV66FE, you save an additional 10% off that price to bring the final cost down to $170 instead of the usual $229</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>12th Gen Intel N95 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD storage, and triple-display support with 4K output</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Delivers Real Performance</h2>
<p>The Alder Lake N95 processor runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz, <strong>and turboes up to 3.4GHz when needed</strong>. This will smoothly handle everyday computing tasks. The quad-core chip with 6MB L3 cache outperforms the older N5105 and N5095 processors by about 35% in CPU tasks and about 78% in GPU performance. You can just go ahead and browse dozens of browser tabs, edit documents, manage spreadsheets, and stream video without any slowdowns.</p>
<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM keeps multiple applications running simultaneously without forcing your computer to swap data to slower storage. You can have Chrome open with 30 tabs running, Microsoft Office applications running in the background, stream music and have video calls going on with no memory bottlenecks. The generous RAM capacity future-proofs the system as software continues demanding more memory.</p>



<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD offers fast boot time and application loading and makes the entire system seem responsive. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch almost instantly, and file transfers are quick. The SSD includes ample room for operating system, applications, and personal files without the need for constant storage management.</p>
<p><strong>Triple-display support via two HDMI and one VGA port</strong> lets you connect three monitors simultaneously for massive workspace. The HDMI outputs support 4K at 60Hz, which means text and color on modern displays come out sharp. You can dedicate one screen to email and messaging, another to your main work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older monitors and projectors that haven’t transitioned to HDMI.</p>
<p><strong>VESA mounting brackets</strong> let you attach the mini PC directly to the back of your monitor, creating an all-in-one computer setup that saves desk space. The compact 5.1 x 5.1 x 1.96-inch dimensions disappear behind displays, keeping your workspace clean and cable management simple. This small form factor fits perfectly in crowded workstations, home theaters behind TVs, digital signage installations, or anywhere space is limited.</p>



<p><strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> provides stable wired network connections for consistent speeds and low latency. Dual-band Wi-Fi features both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks for wireless flexibility where Ethernet isn’t practical. <strong>Bluetooth 4.2 connects wireless keyboards, mice, speakers, and headphones</strong> without dongle clutter. Several USB ports handle peripherals, external drives and accessories simultaneously.</p>
<p>The <strong>cooling fan keeps the processor at optimal temperatures</strong> during sustained workloads and cools quietly during normal operation, only spinning up when performing more computationally intensive tasks. The cooling system keeps thermal throttling at bay, which would slow performance with jobs such as video encoding, code compilation, or running multiple demanding applications.</p>
<p>At $170 after stacking discounts, this mini PC offers modern Intel performance, 16GB of RAM, and triple 4K display support for a lot less than budget laptops with far worse specifications. You’re getting a complete desktop replacement that handles work, entertainment, and even creativity without the bulk or cost of traditional towers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FaZe Clan Fans Aren’t Happy With New Rollbit Jersey]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-faze-jersey-rollbit-partnership-fans-angry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/faze-clan-fans-aren%E2%80%99t-happy-with-new-rollbit-jersey.1362373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, FaZe Clan unveiled its 2026 esports jersey, and fans were immediately displeased by the excessive ‘Rollbit’ branding that was slapped on the front and shoulder of it. In recent weeks, the heavy marketing push that Rollbit has been making into streaming and content creation has left fans and viewers dismayed at some, but no matter what, the bags keep flowing.</p>



<p>The jersey would look fantastic, some argue, if the sponsorship branding were either toned back or removed entirely, but that’s not going to happen.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-s-new-rollbit-jersey-sparks-outcry">FaZe Clan’s New Rollbit Jersey Sparks Outcry</h2>



<p>On social media, FaZe Clan uncovered the jersey that the pro teams under the banner will be sporting for the next year of competition. Fans were quick to point out that once prestigious sponsorships like Nissan and G-Fuel have long been removed, and in their place sits a glaring ROLLBIT sponsorship.</p>



<p>The jersey, which is a nice black and red digital camo design, has come under intense criticism by fans, commenting that the FaZe logo is ‘smaller than the Rollbit branding’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rollbit has been the cause of some inflammation across the esports and streaming industries of late, offering immense bags to high-ranking streamers to host gambling streams, some of which have thrown entire fanbases into question. Now, that influence is being felt in esports via sponsorships like this.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user wrote a damning review:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the gambling sponsor being larger than the team logo and in several places I highly doubt many will sell. Glad I got mine a few years ago when it looked like a team jersey (with) a few sponsors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote, ‘I thought this was FaZe, not Team Rollbit.’</p>



<p>Other fans were less critical and stressed that the jersey is ‘fire’, while some tried to field some suggestions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Idk how i feel bout that big rollbit logo in the middle of it if you left that off and just kept it with the red and black design continuing on the front it’d be clean</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Following the mixed reception to its debut title, the free-to-play arena shooter game The Finals, Embark Studios returns stronger than ever with ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter title. Here's an overview of everything we know about this game.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> before The Finals, during The Game Awards 2021. Back then, Embark conceived it as a free-to-play cooperative (PvE) third-person shooter game, but it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked to be a buy-to-play PvPvE game</a>. This, of course, meant a delay over the original plan. </p>



<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Embark finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final launch date: October 30, 2025. The game is available in two purchase options. The Standard Edition is priced at $39.99. For those seeking extras, a Deluxe Edition is offered at $59.99. This version of the game provides 2,400 Raider Tokens (used as in-game currency) as well as "The Wanderer" Pack, which includes the Valente Outfit, Pathfinder Backpack, and Blanket Roll. Inside the game, there are paid options for cosmetic-only purchases and battle pass-style content via Raider Tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly earlier, the final version of ARC Raiders is a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, with the devastated landscape specifically centered on the Italian coast. Humanity has been forced to retreat underground after a catastrophic event: an invasion by ARC units, mysterious mechanical enemies that descended from orbit in overwhelming numbers. The few survivors now huddle in the subterranean city of Toledo in the District of Speranza and surface only when necessary to scavenge and survive among the ruins above.</p>



<p>Arguably, what really sets ARC Raiders apart visually is its retro-futuristic vision, blending Cold War analog tech with advanced robotics and rich atmospheric detail. The world is streaked with neon, battered by fog and synth-heavy soundscapes, and every corner tells a story of a society that once was.</p>



<p>Just like most extraction shooters, ARC Raiders does not feature a traditional story campaign. The game does, however, include narrative bits that the players can discover through environmental clues, NPC interactions, and evolving background quests. Players are "Raiders," those few resourceful survivors that risk the dangers of the topside in search of loot (mechanically) and answers, such as what happened with the ARC invasion and the fate of Earth's vanished elite. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The core gameplay experience of ARC Raiders revolves around raiding, scavenging, and ultimately extracting. Each expedition on the surface is a tense, half-hour race against time, as players band together in squads of three or two players (although it is also possible to queue solo) to delve into dangerous zones, whose environments range from crumbling cities and derelict bunkers to the rusting debris of fallen spacecraft.</p>



<p>Players must carefully navigate the post-apocalyptic maps, being wary of both the hostile ARC robots and other human players who are also hunting the same vital resources. Tactics, aim, and squad coordination are essential, not least because at any moment a failed fight can mean the loss of everything not safely stored. The game’s extraction mechanic adds another strategic layer, requiring Raiders to find and reach specific extraction points before time—or luck—runs out. Extraction can be accomplished via elevators, metro stations, or secure hatches that require special keys and offer safer withdrawal, but each method presents its own risk and reward trade-offs.</p>



<p>The constant tension of loss and reward is what drives progression. Upon a successful extraction, teams return with valuable materials and equipment, which can be used to upgrade gear and base facilities for future runs. Anything not successfully extracted is, however, forfeit. Collaboration is therefore both supported and encouraged, as squads must rely on careful coordination to contend with unpredictable PvP encounters and environmental hazards, ranging from dynamic enemy spawns to changing weather and toxic zones. Notably, the game features a "Match Journey" system, which chronicles the story of each run.</p>

<p>One of the actors nominated at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has spoken up about his surprise nod. Even more so, the actor goes as far as to credit the nomination to his French counterpart.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s biggest games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seemingly came out of nowhere to some. Sporting incredible turn-based combat and excellent performances, it’s no wonder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it broke records</a> at this year’s Game Awards. Its most impressive feat is having three of its cast (Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and Charlie Cox) nominated for Best Game Performance. Still, it seems one of the actors has responded to the nomination, and in a pretty interesting way.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/bursinxmurdock/status/1992178421779083283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video at La Conve/Animex</a> in Mexico, Daredevil actor <strong>Charlie Cox</strong> is asked about <strong>his nomination for his role as Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>. Humbly, the actor <strong>credits the nomination to Maxence Cazorla</strong>, who played and did motion capture for the role in French. Cazorla also plays Esquie in both the French and English dubs of the title. Charlie’s response, seen in the video, is available below,</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m thrilled for this nomination</strong>,” says Cox. “<strong>I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say…there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]. Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him. The performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice just was part of that process.</strong>“</p>



<p>Even still, fans were quick to praise Charlie’s great performance. Without getting into spoilers, Gustave is essential to the narrative, so it’s not surprising to see Charlie get his flowers. However, Cox’s co-stars, Jennifer English (Maelle) and Ben Starr (Verso), are hot off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Joystick wins</a>, so they do have a better chance. The three are going up against Silent Hill f’s Konatsu Kato, Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle’s Troy Baker, and Ghost of Yotei’s Erika Iishi. We’ll know who takes the trophy home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th, 2025</a>.</p>
