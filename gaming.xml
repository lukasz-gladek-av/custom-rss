There isn't a huge list of things that'll immediately sell me on your game, but there is one that'll draw me in without fail pretty much every single time: you can drive around in a kei truck. Now, admittedly, there are very few games where you can actually do this, the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> being the most recent one. There's the yet to be released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2961860/Honcho/">Honcho</a> from the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/landlords-super">Landlord's Super</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a>, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/easy-delivery-co">Easy Delivery Co.</a>, a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin.
</p>

<p>
In Easy Delivery Co., you are an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> by way of PS1 game-esque cat character, who drives around a kei truck in a snowy mountainside town delivering different things. That indie PS1 aesthetic can obviously feel a bit overdone in some cases now, but Easy Delivery Co. just looks right, a bit dreary, a bit lonely even, yet with a hint of goofiness about it. Good stuff!

The game's Steam page notes that there's "definitely no secrets", which between you and me I think might just be a lie. Apparently the soundtrack is made up of lo-fi, drum 'n' bass, and jungle tracks, a real late '90s, early 2000s arcade racer vibe it seems. Oh, and there's a four-player split-screen co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> mode too? Dang, this game was just made to be played on a CRT, something I'll be doing as soon as I'm able to.
</p>
<p>
According to a press release developer Sam C is inspired by games like Animal Crossing, but also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a>, a pairing of games I would never think to make in my life, except here I am craving just that. No release date in sight for Easy Delivery Co. bar "later this year", so in the meantime you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>, and check out its demo too!

I'm sure like me, some of you would really like another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game. A Nier 3, if you will, except I won't, because it already came out and it was called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. Unfortunately it was also a free-to-play mobile game, and as most mobile games are destined for, it shut down last year rendering it completely unplayable. Nier celebrated its 15th anniversary this year, so far with no big announcements, though there is a new website that's slowly sharing bits of a special novel. And curiously enough, it appears to be teasing something Nier Reincarnation related.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k">journalist Willa Rowe</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update">IGN</a>), the website is doing something a bit odd. At the end of the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/">most recently released chapter</a>, there's some kind of computer log, a cryptic bit of text that specifically references the official Japanese website for Nier Reincarnation. In fact the specific wording leading up to the link to said website says "recovery protocol initialised."
</p>
<p>
There's even some lore stuff teased when you right click and view page source, referencing characters called Her and Him that appeared in Reincarnation, as well as a reference to The Cage, the main setting of the game. It's all a bit odd, suitably Yoko Taro, and of course has me and everyone else hoping that this is suggesting some kind of Nier Reincarnation re-release/ port is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Here's the thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>: I'd really like it if you did that. I didn't manage to catch up to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> main story in time, and even if I put all of the combat stuff on autopilot it's just not the same watching cutscene compilations on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
We can only assume that some kind of Nier project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/big-cool-weirdo-yoko-taro-may-or-may-not-be-working-on-something-that-may-or-may-not-be-nier">will be coming, some time, eventually, maybe</a>, though it would be nice for an actual bit of news. Or, like, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier Automata</a> re-release with an equally annoying name to write as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant ver. 1.22</a> blah blah blah's that adds a lore critical sword or whatever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-start-ringing-the-new-skates-death-knell-because-ea-says-its-online-only<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I think to properly convey my severe dislike of always online games I'd probably need more space and time than what an average RPS news article provides, but I'll try to contain myself on this one. You see, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA's</a> just started up this new thing it calls <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one?isLocalized=true">The Grind</a> (like what you do on a skateboard, get it?), which they describe as their "platform to talk directly to you, the community." The first volume had quite a few questions from expectant skaters about the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> reboot, one of the first being whether or not it'll have an offline mode. Can you already guess from my tone so far that it won't?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Because, as EA put it, "the simple answer" is "no." They go on to explain that the "game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities." According to EA, this isn't possible without a live connection, which I'm sure might actually have a technical justification, it just stinks a bit.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that they want to Fortnite-ify Skate so that the city can change in substantial ways, which is a cool concept! It just also means you're eventually bound to get situations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> where the game is just unplayable (which has resulted in a lawsuit, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-2-is-getting-an-offline-mode-play-test-and-it-unsurprisingly-wont-have-all-of-its-online-features">offline modes for The Crew 2 and Motorfest</a>). Maybe EA will add in an offline mode eventually so that the game will last longer than the live service fad, but I won't put any bets on it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other, less annoying details, EA do still plan to launch Skate into early access some time in 2025 at least. They also clarified that "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash," if you're someone that likes your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play games</a> to be completely free. New areas won't be paywalled either, and there's no sort of pay-to-win element. Still don't like the online-only stuff, but all of that sounds good at least.

						<h5>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</h5><p><span>April 22nd, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, Windows Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>No matter how it is looked at, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of the few video games released to date that can be described as magical. Launching at a time when the medium was about to blow up like it never managed to do before, the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda took everything its predecessor did right, and brought it up to eleven in such a way that no one who happened to get acquainted with Emperor Uriel Septim VII in the dungeons of the Imperial Prison could ever forget the journey through Cyrodiil to prevent the forces of Oblivion from ravaging Tamriel.</p>
<p>Though it is fondly remembered by all those who had the pleasure of experiencing it, the original Oblivion is not without issues. While revolutionary in many ways, some of the gameplay features felt somewhat clunky, even in 2006, and the usual smattering of Bethesda's trademark bugs negatively impacted the experience, although they ultimately contributed to the game's legendary and magical status.</p>
<p>Nineteen years later, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to bring back their magical role-playing game with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and so far, the player response seems great, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four million players registered in the first four days</a>. This remaster does an excellent job updating the classic role-playing game without removing any of the features that still make it unique to this day, for better or worse, starting with the massively enhanced visuals. Taking advantage of the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, Virtuos did an incredible job making Cyrodiil look gorgeous with new character models that do a much better job higlighting the physical differences between the different races, a new lighting system powered by UE5 Lumen, new highly-detailed environmental assets, new weather effects and spell animations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250423173956_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most new visual features and changes look incredible, but they have some downsides. For starters, as sadly expected in a game powered by Unreal Engine 5, there are performance issues on PC. The game runs pretty well in closed-off environments, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired in the open world. In two different benchmarking sessions, held in the sewers during The Path of Dawn quest to meet with the Sponsor to obtain the Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4 book, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode, Frame Generation Hardware Lumen and every setting at high, the game ran at an average of 141 FPS, 24 1% low, with minimal stuttering that did not impact the experience a lot.</p>
<p>In the open world, however, things are quite different, as the game ran at an average of 107 FPS, 15 1% low with frequent stuttering. My system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) should be more than capable of handling Oblivion Remastered well, at least based on the system requirements, so it's clear that more work is needed on the optimization front. During my first playthrough of the base game's main quest, the game also crashed a few times, so the remaster suffers from some stability issues.</p>
<p>Besides the performance and stability issues, which will hopefully get addressed with post-launch updates, there's one more reason why some may not particularly like a visual overhaul of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The original's distinct bloom-heavy looks and soft and hazy lighting, which suited the game's unique dreamlike nature, have been completely replaced with a more toned-down look and darker color grading that aligns with modern games. I didn't mind the more grounded tone of the overhauled visuals too much, but there's no denying that something has inevitably been lost in the remaster. This is ultimately a more subjective point of view, though, and it's one easily remedied on PC with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReShade presets</a> and the like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250424170447_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gameplay improvements featured in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered are sure to be more universally appreciated, as they increase the fun without taking away some of the game's unique quirks.</p>
<p>The improved movement and combat animations make fighting enemies more satisfying, as hits have more weight and impact than the original. Third-person camera and controls, which allow players to move the character independently from the camera's direction, have been vastly improved and are in line with Bethesda's latest RPG offering, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a>. This makes playing the game in third-person view more viable than ever. However, in my opinion, the first-person view is still the best way to play.</p>
<p>Another addition that massively improves the experience is the ability to sprint, which makes traversal faster and, in turn, the entire experience more enjoyable, although it comes with the side effect of making the game's map feel slightly smaller. Other welcome changes are the interface overhaul which brings the game on par with its successor, Skyrim, some new menu shortcuts assigned to a controller's dpad which make accessing fundamental menu features much smoother like inventory and map, a brand new character creator that allows players to go even crazier and create some of the most unnerving mosntrousities seen this side of Tamriel, an overhauled, and much better, leveling system, and toned down enemy scaling which makes the game slightly more approachable at all difficulty levels.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered also features audio enhancements, such as new voicework across the game added on top of the old voicework. There are additional voiced lines from renowned actors like Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart, new environmental audio effects for NPC voices and sound to make the experience more immersive, new combat sound effects, and a higher quality soundtrack, which is highly welcome, considering how good it is even at a lower quality. These improvements, much like the gameplay enhancements and the inclusion of all downloadable content released for the original, including the excellent The Shivering Isles expansion, go a long way toward making The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered the definitive edition of the game, and the best way to experience this epic quest in 2025, though some newcomers will inevitably have trouble getting into the game if all they have experienced of the series is Skyrim.</p>

<p>Even with its new coat of paint and all gameplay enhancements, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is still markedly a game from the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics powered by the the original game engine, the remaster still plays like it for the most part, with all its clunkiness almost intact, its smallish open world, compared to modern games, its weird NPCs, who still behave in their iconic comical way, like the iconic Highwayman taking gold from the player, only to comment how worthless it is once it is stolen back, its quirky combat system that often makes fighting enemies more frustrating than fun, and a general "randomness" to the entire experience that can feel very hard to get into, coming off from modern RPG or even just Skyrim. It's this randomness, however, that makes Oblivion such a unique game.</p>
<p>Anything can happen in Cyrondiil. A grounded quest may turn into complete mayhem as it proceeds, and NPCs and other gameplay elements may interact unexpectedly and sometimes comically, with the same unpredictability of a dream, incentivizing experimentation like in the best immersive role-playing games on the market. It is not an experience for everyone, to be sure, but once it clicks, one becomes a fan of life, making it very easy to set aside the game's undeniable shortcomings completely.</p>

<p>Though some of the changes and the performance issues will inevitably turn some players off, there's no denying that the fourth entry in the series couldn't have made its debut on modern gaming platforms better than it did with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Updating the experience where required while keeping true to the original, Virtuos has developed an amazing remaster that does proper justice to one of the most beloved role-playing games ever released. PC players can also tweak it further to their liking thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many mods already available on Nexus</a>.</p>

The thing about computers is that they're just really annoying, actually. They're massively complicated, constantly changing machines, and despite the fact the hardware is technically better now, they can sometimes struggle to run older games because of… reasons. Those reasons often being software issues I won't even attempt to understand. So, it always brings a smile to my face when I see another game back from the dead through the efforts of GOG's preservation program, the most recent entry being the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breath-of-fire-iv">Breath of Fire 4</a>.
</p>

<p>
You see, Breath of Fire 4 did actually have a PC release way back in the day. It was originally released for the PS1 back in 2000, later coming to PC in 2003, though only for Japan and Europe. As mentioned, the problem with older PC games is that they don't always work on modern hardware, and ignoring that it can be tough to track down legitimate copies of certain games. With <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 joining GOG's preservation program</a> however, it's now playable on Windows 10 and 11.

<p>
Outside of that, there's a few new display options like a windowed mode, V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing, and refined gamma correction for better visuals, alongside an upgrade to the audio engine. That one has brought back some previously missing environmental sounds, and you'll have a few options to tinker around with now too. Plus, it being GOG, the game is DRM-free, so if you decide to pick it up it's yours forever.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 isn't the only game to be spruced up either, there's other classics like Ultima Underworld 1+2, Worms: Armageddon, and Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon. Good stuff! Looking forward to whatever the GOG preservation program brings back next.

            <p>The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role.</p>
<p>The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, which shared the shot, said it's been "quite a trick" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers.</p>
<p><strong>There are light spoilers ahead</strong>, so click away now if you're prefer to watch the show without advance knowledge.</p>

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/nacon">Nacon</a> did something unthinkable, completely unpredictable with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">they delayed it</a>. Alright, fine, generally the opposite is true for big games these days, but it did come down to the wire in the greater scheme of things as it was due out this coming May 20th. Now the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> is slated to be released on June 10th (or June 5th for those with early access), just three weeks extra. That "meh" news did come with some "oh that's cool" news though, as a large-scale beta was promised. Now, following a snazzy new story trailer, a date for said beta has been set!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to said trailer, the beta is taking place this coming May 9th to 12th, with a press release claiming it'll be the biggest one yet. That doesn't mean you're guaranteed access though, you'll have to request to take part on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">game's Steam page</a>. Alternatively on May 10th a livestream is being held which will be giving out tens of thousands of beta keys, so your chances generally sound pretty good. Said livestream will be <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom/schedule?segmentID=49b3762a-2470-485a-9a21-ce7ad63209c0">held on Nacon's Twitch channel</a>.

<p>
The beta sounds like it'll be a pretty beefy one too, the press release notes that it'll include the first 20 hours of the game and "most of Act 1 of the story." Unlike previous betas, there won't be an NDA this time, so you'll be free to post about getting eaten by a sandworm or whatever to your heart's content.
</p>
<p>
That new story trailer also very much seems to be setting up a chosen one-esque storyline which isn't anything new to the MMO genre, though I do think it's a bit tired by now. Ah well, I'm sure a bit of spice will set things right.

The French RPG is clearly inspired by the Japanese greats like <em>Final Fantasy </em>and <em>Persona</em>, but its <em>Paper Mario</em>-style timing elements and wealth of original mechanics keep its grind engaging and decidedly modern. My time with the game hasn’t been without frustrations, but I’m writing these impressions wishing I could be playing the game instead. That’s gotta count for something. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46516965fadfe423111db17f56ff74e5" data-recommend-id="image://46516965fadfe423111db17f56ff74e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Takumi wakes up at a school desk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi wakes up at a school desk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46516965fadfe423111db17f56ff74e5" data-recommend-id="image://46516965fadfe423111db17f56ff74e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Takumi wakes up at a school desk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When <em>Danganronpa </em>creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape </em>director Kotaro Uchikoshi joined forces to found Too Kyo Games in 2017, I was curious to see just what the two legends of so-called “death games” would create together.

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty</a> fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a "replica explosive device" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media.</p>

<p>"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag," the TSA quipped in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542">Facebook post</a>, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p>
<p>The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it.</p>
<p>"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?" asked one.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only</a>. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating.</p>
<p>While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span><span>Jon M. Chu, best known for his recent work on the film adaptation of <em>Wicked</em>, would direct the movie. While Chu has never adapted a video game before, he has built his career transferring stories from other media onto the big screen, including books, cartoons, and recently, Broadway musicals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-until-dawn-movies-greatest-weakness-is-straying-so-far-away-from-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>This article contains spoilers for the </strong></em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-review-david-f-sandberg"><u><em><strong>Until Dawn</strong></em></u></a><em><strong> movie.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been racking my brain over the conundrum that is adapting Until Dawn. Supermassive Games' deconstruction of horror cinema through choice-based butterfly effect mechanics is essentially a 10-hour playable movie—a damn fine one written by indie horror staples Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick—so a film adaptation couldn't just be the same thing. But a film that isn’t indebted to the game and its "choose your own adventure" method doesn't feel appropriate either. Sony's desire to release an Until Dawn adaptation seemed misguided upon announcement, and after viewing the film, it's still a headscratcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's because David F. Sandberg's Until Dawn movie betrays the core hook of Supermassive's Until Dawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writers Gary Dauberman and Blair Butler chose to adapt Until Dawn as its title reads. In this case, "Until Dawn" translates into a time-loop-like horror scenario where five young adults find themselves hunted by various baddies, and they only escape if they can survive … until dawn. Should anyone die, they'll wake once a gigantic hourglass fixed to an ominous, skull-adorned mount drops its last grain of sand. Die enough times, and you become a wendigo lost to Dr. Alan J. Hill's delirious experiment. The core impetus of a missing sibling is still there—Ella Rubin's protagonist, Clover, is hunting for her missing sister—but otherwise, you're not on Blackwood Mountain aka Mount Washington (er…yet), and certainly not similarly punished for choices that alter narrative paths.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's… not Until Dawn. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn Gallery</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Death Shouldn't Be An Afterthought</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the game, death matters. It matters so much, in fact, that killing a single character sends ripple effects felt throughout the remaining storylines. There's no regeneration or second chances. Like, famously. That's the point of Until Dawn. The stakes are so astronomically high, the slightest nervous twitch of your controller during a "stay still" Quicktime event could doom multiple characters. Dauberman and Butler fail to translate the nerve-wracking experience of playing Until Dawn, landing on quite the opposite concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If anything, Until Dawn is a beginner's attempt at Cabin in the Woods. Glore Valley is drenched by a thunderstorm, except for a perfect circle of sunshine over the welcome center location, like some all-powerful horror movie god is controlling the rain—once again resembling Cabin in the Woods in terms of the “influencing environment” effect. The all-seeing overlord (Dr. Hill), the meta nature of characters joking about horror movie rules, and the different creatures unleashed each rewind? Despite countless plot configurations, the game's powerful storytelling is far superior to this random assortment of scary scenes tied to an hourglass clock. The game pulls players deeper into a web of intrigue, where the movie's Mad Libs nature drags viewers through a jumbled rotation of clowns-and-kooks randomness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Points are awarded for at least using wendigos. In the game, Fessenden's "Stranger" character reveals that a 1952 mining cave-in led to cannibalism, and said cannibals turned into wendigos that now haunt Blackwood. Here, Clover and her friends start turning into wendigos due to Dr. Hill's experiments on Glore Valley from his sanatorium hideout (resembling his dingy in-game office). It's not a one-for-one translation, nor does it need to be, but the wendigos are overshadowed by a slasher villain vaguely costumed after Josh's psycho getup. There are also witches, porcelain doll-looking masks, creepypasta demons, and water that makes your entire body explode Scanners-style if you drink it. It's a hodgepodge of dangers that have nothing to do with Fessenden and Reznick's straightforward creature-centric game, outside of a few Easter eggs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious connection is Peter Stormare as Dr. Hill, Josh Washington’s (Rami Malek) hallucinated psychiatrist who runs players through rigorous psychological tests that influence future in-game details. However, even Dr. Hill features stark differences in the film vs. the original game. In the movie, he's seen as a gas station attendant, but it's not long before he's outed as former game character Dr. Hill—who's in control of experiments on Glore Valley. It’s here where we have the only direct reference to the game’s most well-known character, Josh Washington. After Clover discovers Hill’s “office,” we see her patient profile alongside Josh’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some exposition about Hill's experiments as we watch prisoners cannibalize bodies and then turn into wendigos to highlight that connection to the game, but the reveal is followed by Clover defeating Dr. Hill pretty easily. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except she doesn’t. Probably. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the film ends, we return to the dirty sanitarium office where Dr. Hill explodes after ingesting some 'splodey water, and on surveillance monitors, we see Blackwood's lodge. We then hear Dr. Hill speak, suggesting he was Clover's hallucination, much like Josh's in the game. But, that's right before the credits because I guess Sandberg's movie is an offshoot prequel that, for some reason, has nothing to do with the actual events of the Until Dawn game? If there is a sequel, presumably it'll be about Josh's case of vengeance paid unto the Blackwood group except based on the film's rules … somehow.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cheap Easter Eggs Aren't Enough</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just all so generic. Turning Dr. Hill into the baddie removes intrigue and becomes a cheap cop-out, torn from the game but improperly refitted. Then the stinger of Blackwood hits, which again is confusing <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3865395/practical-effects-easter-eggs-deleted-scenes-more-with-until-dawn-director-david-sandberg-maxime-alexandre-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>because in interviews</u></a>, Sandberg insists his film takes place after the game's timeline—but Blackwood's reveal suggests it's not a sequel, but a prequel. Inconsequentiality plagues Sandberg's film in a way that makes you wonder why it's even tied to Until Dawn (*cough* intellectual property reasons *cough*), which only causes Blackwood's tease to be even more spoonfed and underwhelming. For so long, Until Dawn (the movie) bears no resemblance to Until Dawn (the game)—why pivot back toward the game at the last minute?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Until Dawn: Movie Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason is simple: to appease us fans. There are choice moments that attempt to help us relive the game, but they're crammed in like afterthoughts. Ji-young Yoo's spiritualist character Megan has everyone hold hands in silence, mimicking the game's quiet "hold your breath" Quicktime events. There's a shot bathed in red lighting where a wendigo is right by a frightened Clover, and that's a direct reference to the "Don't Move" instructions. But the game's cinematic nature doesn't yield many other level-based opportunities to recreate, nor does the film try. The adaptation’s biggest issue is it never fully comprehends how best to honor Supermassive's inspiration while telling a fresh horror tale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What else might you recognize? The wendigo audio files are plucked from the game, reusing the same noises. There's also Abe's first death of being chopped in half, which could be respect paid to Josh's fake death in the game, or maybe that's just a lucky coincidence. Are the werewolf sketches in the witch's cabin a possible reference to The Quarry? Is the radio in the basement the same radio in the game where characters find out they must survive until dawn? Chances are yes, but these Easter eggs feel forced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look, I'm all for a "spiritual successor." But to do so, there has to be some resemblance to the thing you are named after. While I don't think Until Dawn is a terrible movie, it's a bad Until Dawn movie. It's a far cry from the urgency and invasive dread that Supermassive so easily conjures, speaking to what makes the playable horror movie such a blast to complete (over and over). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As is, the Until Dawn movie doesn't make much sense in context. The events of Glore Valley are a grab bag of ideas from other horror movies that would be nothing but a clip show without Dr. Hill's inclusion. But even with Stormare's reprised role, it's only Until Dawn at face value, nothing deeper. I get the interpretation of the gang's choices forcing them to keep restarting, but it's still too far off-base to consider this adaptation anything more than unfaithful. In the end, Until Dawn is a missed opportunity to bring Supermassive's smash-hit game to life.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-death-guard-poxwrought-vector-review-so-sick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nurgle, the chaos god of rot and decay (and, some would say, rebirth) is back in a big way with the release of a brand new box set of miniatures for the Death Guard Chaos Space Marines army! This week, overall, is a great week for Chaos (check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-world-eaters-gorestorm-slaughterpack-review-gory-goodness" rel="nofollow">our review of the other new Chaos Battleforce, the Gorestorm Slaughterpack</a>), so follow along as we hold our noses and get into the funk with the Poxwrought Vector Battleforce box, up for preorder now!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce Contents:</h2>

<p>The Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;contains the following miniatures:</p>

<ul><li>1x Lord of Poxes</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Foetid Bloat-drone</li>
	<li>1x Myphitic Blight-hauler</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Plagueburst Crawler</li>
	<li>5x Blightlord Terminators</li>
	<li>7x&nbsp;Plague Marines</li>
</ul><h3>Reappearing Ability: Nurgle's Gift [Aura]</h3>

<p>Many of the units in this box come with the Nurgle's Gift [Aura] special ability, so I think it's worth explaining that here before we dive into individual unit profiles! With a contagion range emanating out from each unit unit (range grows in the first three rounds), and while an enemy unit is within that range, that unit is Afflicted with one of three abilities you choose at the Declare Battle Formations step:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>Each enemy unit that is Afflicted has 1 toughness subtracted.</li>
	<li><b>Option 1 - Skullsquirm Blight:&nbsp;</b>Each time a model in this (afflicted) unit makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 2 - Rattlejoint Ague:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1.</li>
	<li><strong>Option 3 - Scabrous Soulrot:&nbsp;</strong>Worsen the Move, Leadership, and Objective Control characteristics of models in this unit by 1 (this rule can only worsen a model's OC characteristic to a minimum of 1).</li>
</ul><p>Now that we understand how Nurgle's Gift works, let's dive into the individual units!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- NEW UNIT:&nbsp;<b>Lord of Poxes</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-lord-of-poxes.jpg?itok=O3Fe8ZcB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-lord-of-poxes.jpg?itok=ADujXL09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This brand new unit emanates a cloud of spore-thick plague smog - sounds nasty, right? It is!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Lord of Poxes Stats: </b>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ (4+ invuln.) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 1</p>

<p><b>Lord of Poxes Ranged Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plasma Pistol (standard):&nbsp;</b>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 7 / AP: -2 / Damage: 1</li>
	<li><strong>Plasma Pistol (supercharged) (pistol/hazardous):&nbsp;</strong>Range: 12" / Attacks: 1 / BS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -3 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul><p><b>Lord of Poxes Melee Weapons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Great plague blade (devastating wounds, lethal hits): </b>Attacks: 6 / WS: 2+ / Strength: 8 / AP: -2 / Damage: 2</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Lord of Poxes Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Gift of Poxes:&nbsp;</strong>Add 3" to the range of this model's Contagion Range.</li>
	<li><strong>Shroud of Disease:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit cannot be targeted by ranged attacks unless the attacking model is within 18".</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Lord of Poxes:</h3>

<p>This unit can lead as an attachment to a unit of Plague Marines, and that's the best way to get him in there. Though not incredible on his own, by attaching him you're shielding your Marines from long-range weaponry with his Shroud of Disease ability. And extending out the Contagion Range turns an ordinary unit of Plague Marines into a walking, festering cloud of de-buffs.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Unit: Plague Marines</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Plague Marines Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 5” / Toughness: 6 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 2 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 2</p>

<p><strong>Plague Marines Ranged Weapon Options:</strong></p>

<ul><li><b>Bolt Gun (standard), Blight Launcher, Bolt Pistol, Meltagun, Plague Belcher, Plague Spewer, Plasma Gun, Plasma Pistol</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Plague Marines Melee Weapon Options:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Plague Knives (standard), Bubotic Weapons, Heavy Plague Weapon, Power Fist</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Plague Marines Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Infused with the Blessings of Nurgle:</strong>&nbsp;In your Shooting phase, each time this unit is selected to shoot, after this unit has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until the start of your next turn, that enemy unit is Afflicted (<em>see Nurgle's Gift</em>&nbsp;<em>above for more info on Afflicted)</em></li>
	<li><strong>Icon of Despair (Aura):&nbsp;</strong>This Wargear Ability states that when an enemy unit is within 6" of the bearer, worsen the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plague Marines:</h3>

<p>When paired with the Lord of Poxes, these Plague Marines should really be run as a tough, shoot-y unit that's out there sitting on an objective and spraying around the Afflicted condition on enemies that try to get close-in.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Unit: Blightlord Terminators</h2>

<p><strong>Blightlord Terminators Ranged Weapon Options:</strong></p>

<ul><li><b>Combi-bolter (standard), Blight Launcher, Combi-weapon, Plague Spewer, Reaper Autocannon</b></li>
</ul><p><b>Plague Marines Melee Weapon Options:</b></p>

<ul><li><b>Bubotic Blade (standard), Close Combat Weapon, Flail of Corruption</b></li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3>Blightlord Terminators Key Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift (Aura):</strong> See Above</li>
	<li><strong>Blistering Fusillade:</strong>&nbsp;If this unit has a Starting Strength of 5 or more, or if a Character is leading this unit, then each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack that targets an Afflicted unit, improve the Strength and Armor Penetration characteristics of that attack by 1.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Blightlord Terminators:</h3>

<p>There's nothing quite like slowly stomping toward your opponents (or unloading from a transport vehicle!) with a unit of Terminators, hunkering down with your 2+ save, and blasting them to bits. Add in the benefit you get from targeting Afflicted units, and it's about to get stanky in here!</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Myphitic Blight-Hauler</h2>

	<li><strong>Tank Hunters:&nbsp;</strong>In your Shooting phase, each time a model in this unit makes an attack that targets a Monster or Vehicle unit, add 1 to the Hit roll and 1 to the Wound roll.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Myphitic Blight-Hauler:</h3>

<p>There's a nice mobility here you don't find in on-foot units from this slow-as-sludge army, but unless you're expecting a lot of tanks in the meta you're up against, this might spend most of its time lobbing missiles and bile from a distance, hoping to score a few odd hits.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Plagueburst Crawler</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-plagueburst-crawler.jpg?itok=i-DHm7Qd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-plagueburst-crawler.jpg?itok=p5ub1hfT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This heavily armored tank is here to rain down destruction in the form of a punishing volley of artillery, including the deadly Plagueburst mortar.</p>

<h3><b>Plagueburst Crawler Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Spore-laced Shock Waves:&nbsp;</strong>In your shooting phase, each time you select a target for this model's Plagueburst mortar, roll one D6 for the target unit and every other enemy unit within 3" of the target unit, adding 1 to that roll if the unit being rolled for is Afflicted. On a 6+, the unit being rolled for is struck by spores; after resolving all of this model's attacks against the target unit, each unit struck by spores suffers D3 mortal wounds.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running Plagueburst Crawler:</h3>

<p>This is one of those units where the flavor of the weaponry at hand really shines through&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;helps guide you toward a play style. You want to send out shock-waves of spores into the thick of battle, so position your Plagueburst Crawler in just the right spot, launch that 48" ranged Mortar at your enemies, and laugh in that hacking cough way you do as the spores rain down destruction.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector&nbsp;- Foetid Bloat-Drone</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-guard-foetid-bloat-drone.jpg?itok=T9un4PKM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-guard-foetid-bloat-drone.jpg?itok=mDA06BbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Floating above the fray, moseying over to enemy units to chop them up into bits, this unit is great and causing mass chaos on the battlefield. Though the standard build is with the powerful Fleshmower, you can replace that with two plaguespitters if you want a more ranged approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Stats: </b>Move: 10” / Toughness: 9 / Save: 3+ (5+ invuln.) / Wounds: 10 / Leadership: 6+ / OC: 3</p>

<ul><li><b>Fleshmower (lethal hits): </b>Attacks: 10&nbsp;/ WS: 3+ / Strength: 7&nbsp;/ AP: -1&nbsp;/ Damage: 2</li>
	<li><strong>Plague Probe (lethal hits):&nbsp;</strong>Attacks: 3 / WS: 3+ / Strength: 6 / AP: -1 / Damage: 1</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h3><b>Foetid Bloat-Drone Key Abilities At A Glance:</b></h3>

<ul><li><strong>Nurgle's Gift:&nbsp;</strong>(see above)</li>
	<li><strong>Hovering Death:&nbsp;</strong>This unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in which it Fell Back.</li>
</ul><h3>Play Tips For Running The Foetid Bloat-Drone:</h3>

<p>How you want to build this unit is up to you, as I think there's an argument to be made either to have two auto-hitting plaguespitters equipped, or the 10 (!!) hits on the Fleshmower. Either way, this unit is meant to get into the action, belt out wounds, and next turn fall back thanks to its Hovering Death ability.</p>

<h2>Poxwrought Vector Battleforce - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Now&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;is what a Battleforce should look like, in my opinion. With six different types of units included, this vehicle-heavy box set is a really fun way to get a new army onto the tabletop in a way that feels very different from other boxes. I think, generally speaking, the design of the Death Guard is some of the best in Warhammer 40K, and this box shows how that Nurgle rot manifests across so many different types of units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656284/bionic-bay-review-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Wandering through <em>Bionic Bay</em>’s dark alien world is unsettling and awe-inspiring. There are massive structures with no clear purpose and autonomous factories filled with whirring saw blades and devastating lasers. It’s grim and unforgiving, with little light and harsh shadows that give everything a sinister tone. But then you step on a bomb and your character bounces off of walls like a pinball, and you realize it’s a game of contrasts.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is a curious blend of two very different genres. On the one hand, it’s an atmospheric side-scrolling adventure in the mold of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a> and <em>Limbo</em>, filled with disturbingly stunning environments to explore. At the same time, it’s a hard-as-nails platformer like <em>Super Meat Boy</em>, with elaborate physics that will have you dying repeatedly while trying to find the best route through deadly obstacles. Somehow, the disparate vibes come together surprisingly well.</p><p>What first drew me to <em>Bionic Bay</em> was that dark world. It’s mysterious to the point that I still don’t actually know what it is you’re doing or why. But that mystery is a large part of the appeal. As you make your way through its levels, you’re subject to some incredible and intimidating environments, and it’s largely up to you to figure out what story the world is trying to tell. There are fiery factories, green areas where organic life merges with technology and architecture in disturbing ways, and dank sewers lit up by dripping bioluminescent goo. All of these spaces make you feel minuscule in comparison. It’s the kind of game where almost every moment makes for a great screenshot.</p><p>In order to see it all, though, you have to deal with a very tough game. While there is some relatively simple platforming at first, you’re soon presented with seemingly insurmountable tasks, like a series of spinning saw blades that require exacting jumps to get through. But it’s not as precise as it may seem. One of the more unique elements of <em>Bionic Bay</em> is its physics; the little guy you control is very sturdy and can survive being bounced around, so you can sometimes flop your way through trickier areas.</p><p><em>Bionic Bay</em> is also something of a puzzle game. You have access to multiple powers, like the ability to swap places with an inanimate object or slow down time (though you can only actively be using one). Combine these tools with the floppy physics and there are a lot of creative ways to get through the game.</p><p>Key to this is that <em>Bionic Bay</em> encourages experimentation. You will die a lot, but because the game has such a forgiving checkpoint system, there’s rarely much punishment for failure. Being able to quickly retry a jump keeps the game from being too frustrating while also making it easier to find a route that actually works. And if you have a wild idea about, say, riding on the back of a rocket to avoid killer laser beams, there’s no harm in trying.</p><p>The game isn’t easy. I’ve found myself stuck on a few occasions. And while I wish the game focused a little more on exploration, the weird and unforgiving world is also what helped me persevere through the trickier challenges. I just had to see what was next.</p><p>If you’re a fan of sci-fi works like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/19/15663380/blame-netflix-anime-tsutomu-nihei"><em>Blame!</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086957/dune-part-two-movie-review"><em>Dune</em></a>, with their impressive sense of scale, <em>Bionic Bay</em> offers something very similar. You just have to work hard to see it all.</p><p><sub>Bionic Bay <em>is out now on the PS5 and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

People struggling to place orders on sites like Walmart’s and Target’s encountered all kinds of errors, confusion, and sometimes even cancelation of orders they thought they’d successfully placed.</p><p>Elsewhere, Bethesda finally released <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>after years of rumors and speculation, and <em>Marvel Rivals </em>support players are going on strike.

          <p>For many gamers, this week's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">release of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a> has provided a good excuse to revisit a well-remembered RPG classic from years past. For others, it's provided a good excuse to catch up on a well-regarded game that they haven't gotten around to playing in the nearly two decades since its release.</p>
<p>I'm in that second group. While I've played a fair amount of <em>Skyrim</em> (on platforms ranging from the Xbox 360 to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/the-world-of-skyrim-is-thrilling-and-flawed-in-vr/">VR headsets</a>) and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-impressions-putting-the-vast-back-in-vast-cosmos/"><em>Starfield</em></a>, I've never taken the time to go back to the earlier Bethesda Game Studios RPGs. As such, my impressions of <em>Oblivion</em> before this <em>Remaster</em> have been guided by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2006/03/oblivion/">old critical reactions</a> and the <a href="https://trismegistus.tech/apps/the-cheddar-scrolls/en.html">many</a> <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/this-beloved-oblivion-meme-got-remade-7-years-later-proving-oblivion-remastered-preserves-the-timeless-comedy-of-the-original">memes</a> calling attention to the game's somewhat janky engine.</p>
<p>Playing through the first few hours of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>&nbsp;this week, without the benefit of nostalgia, I can definitely see why <em>Oblivion</em> made such an impact on RPG fans in 2006. But I also see all the ways that the game can feel a bit dated after nearly two decades of advancements in genre design.</p>
<h2>One chance at a first impression</h2>
<p>From the jump, I found myself struggling to suspend my disbelief enough to buy into the narrative conventions <em>Oblivion</em> throws at the beginner player. The fact that the doomed king and his armed guards need to escape through a secret passage that just so happens to cut through my jail cell seems a <em>little</em> too convenient for my brain to accept without warning sirens going off. I know it's just a contrivance to get my personal hero's journey story going, but it's a clunky way to dive into the world.</p>

<p>The same goes for the way the king dies just a few minutes into the tutorial, and his willingness to trust me with the coveted Amulet of Kings because the "Dragonblood" let him "see something" in me. Even allowing for some amount of necessary <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Chosen One trope-iness</a> in this kind of fantasy story, the sheer speed with which my character went from "condemned prisoner" to "the last hope of the dying king" made my head spin a bit. Following that pivotal scene with a dull "go kill some goblins and rats in the sewer" escape sequence also felt a little anticlimactic given the epic responsibility with which I was just entrusted.</p>

<p>To be sure, Patrick Stewart's regal delivery in the early game helps paper over a lot of potential weaknesses with the initial narrative. And even beyond Stewart's excellent performance, I appreciated how the writing is concise and to the point, without the kind of drawn-out, pause-laden delivery that characterizes many games of the time.</p>
<h2>The wide world of <em>Oblivion</em></h2>
<p>Once I escaped out into the broader world of <em>Oblivion</em> for the first time, I was a bit shocked to open my map and see that I could fast travel to a wide range of critical locations immediately, without any need to discover them for myself first. I felt a bit like a guilty cheater warping myself to the location of my next quest waypoint rather than hoofing through the massive forest that I'm sure hundreds of artists spent countless months meticulously constructing (and, more recently, remastering).</p>

<p>I felt less guilty after accidentally stealing a horse, though. After a key quest giver urged me to go take a horse from a nearby stable, I was a bit shocked when I mounted the first horse I saw and heard two heavily armed guards nearby calling me a thief and leaping into pursuit (I guess I should have noticed the red icon before making my mount). No matter, I thought; they're on foot and I'm now on a horse, so I can get away with my inadvertent theft quite easily.</p>
<p>Determined not to just fast-travel through the entire game, I found that galloping across a rain-drenched forest through the in-game night was almost too atmospheric. I ended up turning up the recommended brightness settings a few notches just so I could see the meticulously rendered trees and rocks around me.</p>
<p>After dismounting to rid a cave of some pesky vampires, I returned to the forest to find my stolen horse was nowhere to be found. At this point, I had trouble deciding if this was simply a realistic take on an unsecured, unmonitored horse wandering off or if I was the victim of a janky engine that couldn't keep track of my mount.</p>

<p>The jank was a bit clearer when I randomly stumbled across my first Oblivion gate while wandering through the woods. As I activated the gate to find a world engulfed in brilliant fire, I was surprised to find an armed guard had also appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and apparently still mad about my long-lost stolen horse!</p>
<p>When I deactivated the gate in another attempt to escape justice, I found myself immediately stuck chest deep in the game's scenery, utterly unable to move as that hapless guard tried his best to subdue me. I ended up having to restore an earlier save, losing a few minutes of progress to a game engine that still has its fair share of problems.</p>
<h2>What’s beneath the surface?</h2>
<p>So far, I'm of two minds about <em>Oblivion</em>'s overall world-building. When it comes to the civilized parts of the world, I'm relatively impressed. The towns seem relatively full during the daytime—both in terms of people and in terms of interesting buildings to explore or patronize. I especially enjoy the way every passerby seems to have a unique voice and greeting ready for me, even before I engage them directly. I even think it's kind of cute when these NPCs end a pleasant conversation with a terse "leave me alone!" or "stop talking to me!"</p>

<p>Even the NPCs that seem least relevant to the story seem to have their own deep backstory and motivations; I was especially tickled by an alchemist visiting from afar who asked if I knew the local fine for necrophilia. (It can't hurt to ask, right?) And discussing random rumors with everyone I meet has gone a long way toward establishing the social and political backstory of the world while also providing me with some engaging and far-flung side quests. There's a lot of depth apparent in these interactions, even if I haven't had the chance to come close to fully exploring it yet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the vast spaces in between the cities and towns seem like so much wasted space, at this point. I've quickly learned not to waste much time exploring caves or abandoned mines, which so far seem to house a few middling enemies guarding some relatively useless trinkets in treasure chests. The same goes for going out of my way to activate the various wayshrines and Ayelid Wells that dot the landscape, which have hardly seemed worth the trip (thus far, at least).</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that I've found <em>Oblivion</em>'s early combat almost wholly unengaging so far. Even at a low level, my warrior-mage has been able to make easy work of every random enemy I've faced with a combination of long-range flare spells and close-range sword swings. It definitely doesn't help that I have yet to fight more than two enemies at once, or find a foe that seems to have two strategic brain cells to rub together. Compared to the engaging, tactical group combat of modern action RPGs like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/elden-ring-review-come-see-the-softer-side-of-punishing-difficulty/"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/avowed-review-wait-are-we-the-baddies/"><em>Avowed</em></a>, the battles here feel downright archaic.</p>

<p>I found this was true even as I worked my way through closing my first Oblivion gate, which had recently left the citizens of Kvask as sympathetic refugees huddling on the outskirts of town. Here, I thought, would be some battles that required crafty tactics, powerful items, or at least some level grinding to become more powerful. Instead, amid blood-soaked corridors that wouldn't feel out of place in a <em>Doom</em> game, I found the most challenging speedbumps were mages that sponged up a moderate amount of damage while blindly charging right at me.</p>
<p>While I'm still decidedly in the early part of a game that can easily consume over 100 hours for a completionist, so far I'm having trouble getting past the most dated bits of <em>Oblivion</em>'s design. Character design and vocal production that probably felt revolutionary two decades ago now feel practically standard for the genre, while technical problems and dull combat seem best left in the past. Despite a new coat of paint, this was one <em>Remaster</em> I found difficult to fully connect with so long after its initial release.</p>

Somehow 2006’s trip to Tamriel, known for its weird, potato-faced characters and smeary stretches of low-res verdant grasslands, is now the best-looking Elder Scrolls game ever made. A long history of HD overhauls has conditioned me to expect underwhelming results from remasters – Mass Effect Legendary Edition and Dark Souls Remastered are barely indistinguishable from their Xbox 360 parents, for instance – and so to see the Imperial City that I explored nearly 20 years ago rendered in Unreal Engine 5 with ray tracing was momentarily unbelievable. Not only that, but the game has been enhanced with upgrades to combat, RPG systems, and a multitude of other details. All that considered, I wondered if Bethesda and the project’s developer, Virtuos, had got the title wrong. Surely this is Oblivion <em>Remake</em>, not remastered? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out I wasn’t alone in that thinking. Numerous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">fans have declared it a remake</a>, and even Bruce Nesmith, the senior game designer on the original Oblivion project, has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-designer-says-bethesdas-remaster-is-so-impressive-it-could-be-called-oblivion-20">“I’m not sure [the word] remaster actually does it justice.”</a> But while I doubted Bethesda and Virtuos’ remaster claim at first, after playing several hours it’s actually pretty clear – Oblivion Remastered may look like a remake but it plays like a remaster.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of reasons why Oblivion looks like a remake and they can be easily summed up: Virtuos has done a huge amount of work, with "every single asset redesigned from scratch." In terms of what you physically see on screen, it is all brand new. Every tree, every sword, every crumbling castle. This means Oblivion lives up to modern graphical expectations. Not only is it beautifully textured, it also has gorgeous lighting and a whole new physics system that ensures every arrow and weapon strike affects the world realistically. And while all who you meet in the game are recognisably the same folks you crossed paths with back in 2006, every single NPC model is a brand new creation. It’s a hugely impressive overhaul that rejects the idea of making something that “looks like you remember” and instead aims for something that’s great by 2025 standards. It’s the best a Bethesda Game Studios RPG has ever looked, and if I had seen it before the remaster rumours began I’d probably have believed that it was The Elder Scrolls 6.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just visuals, though. Combat has been overhauled, and so swinging a longsword no longer feels like fencing with a balloon. The third person camera is now actually functional thanks to the addition of a reticule. Every menu, from the quest journal to dialogue to the lockpicking and persuasion minigames, have all had refreshed interfaces. The original, horrific levelling system has been replaced with a much more logical hybrid of Oblivion and Skyrim’s approaches. And <em>finally </em>you can sprint. With so many visual and gameplay upgrades, surely we are firmly in remake territory? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I had seen Oblivion Remastered before the rumours began I’d probably have believed that it was The Elder Scrolls 6.   </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The big issue here is not so much one of technology, game changes, or project scope, but semantics. There are no industry-defined parameters for remakes and remasters, and publishers recklessly throw the terms around. Rockstar’s “Definitive Edition” remasters of the Grand Theft Auto trilogy are unmistakably blocky PlayStation 2-era games with upscaled textures and modern lighting effects. But the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, also branded a remaster, sports all-new graphical assets and looks like a game from the modern era. Things are even muddier when we get to remakes: Bluepoint’s Shadow of the Colossus and Demon’s Souls both rebuild their respective games from the ground up, but are faithful, 1:1 recreations of the original experiences. Resident Evil 2, meanwhile, sticks more-or-less to the original blueprint in terms of structure, but completely redesigns the way you interact with the survival horror icon. And then we have Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth, which radically overhaul the design, script, and even story beats of the original games. All five of these examples are considered remakes, but there’s very little shared philosophy between them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At one point in time, the general consensus seemed to be that if the game had been rebuilt from scratch in a modern engine, it was considered a remake. Remasters, meanwhile, were more limited upgrades performed within the scope of the game’s original technology. Such a definition is clearly becoming fast outdated, though. Today, it seems more fitting to say that a remaster is a graphical overhaul that preserves the design of the original game (bar a few quality of life gameplay upgrades), while a remake redesigns a game from scratch. Such a definition would “downgrade” Demon’s Souls and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid: Delta to remasters, and ensure the remake term only applies to games that genuinely feel like new takes on old ideas. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/25/oblivion-remastered-1745587732759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New lighting, fur, and metallic effects are just the tip of the iceburg of Oblivion Remastered's changes. Image credit: Bethesda / Virtuos</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So if we accept these proposed definitions, is this new version of Oblivion a remake or a remaster? As anyone who’s played even just an hour of it can plainly see, Oblivion Remastered absolutely has the correct name. Yes, those new assets and Unreal Engine 5 ray tracing effects make it look brand new, but beneath that glowing skin is a collection of 20-year-old bones, organs, and muscles, all roughly stapled and taped together in that unmistakably Bethesda way. As the studio explained, “We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it. But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hallmarks of that previous era are everywhere. It's in the loading screens that hide behind almost every single door. It’s in the baffling persuasion minigame that still, despite the interface upgrade, barely makes sense and feels utterly disconnected to your conversations. It’s in the design of the cities, which have the simplistic design of theatre stage sets rather than the complex, knotty arrangements of authentic population centres. It’s in the NPCs, who wander like awkward automatons and talk with all the grace of an AI trained on a “how to be society” manual. It’s in the combat, which even after a significant upgrade still feels detached and unwieldy. And it's in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">long list of bugs and glitches</a> that still remain, reverently preserved in the name of upkeeping the original’s quirky charm. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The granular details of Oblivion are clearly grey and long in the tooth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a couple of months ago we were treated to Obsidian’s Avowed, which offered a vision of the future for some of The Elder Scrolls’ key building blocks. Its kinetic combat is practically space-age compared to Oblivion Remastered’s, while its approach to rewarding exploration makes the rolling hills and grotty caves of Cyrodiil feel very much a relic of yesteryear. Such modern systems help put Oblivion Remastered into context. That’s not to say that this revised classic has nothing to offer in 2025 – far from it. The magic of its world still sparkles brightly, its Rohan-like open fields filled with dozens of mysteries and oddities. Much of its ambition remains intact even two generations later, such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-unpredictable-goblin-wars-of-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-i-introduced-controlled-chaos-whenever-i-could" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dynamic goblin wars</a> that wage between its NPC clans, or the narratively-satisfying questing structure that remains head-and-shoulders above Skyrim’s many “visit a draugr-filled dungeon” missions. Many of its old-school ideas around player freedom feel refreshing in an age where we now reject the hand-holding nature of games from the 2010s. But the granular details of Oblivion are clearly grey and long in the tooth. There’s no finesse in its dialogue, nor elegance in the way its systems interconnect. And the level design, be it cave, castle, or the cursed lands of Oblivion itself, feels positively ancient. A remake’s job would be to update all those ideas, but this project is all about reliving the old. As such: Oblivion <em>Remastered</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Video games have historically leant on terminology from other mediums. In the world of movies, remakes are brand new productions with fresh casts, crews, scripts, and sets. Remasters are existing films that are enhanced as far as possible to match modern picture quality standards. But an old film is still an old film; the 4K restorations of Jaws and The Godfather look incredible, but they are clearly products of the 1970s. You can see it in the direction, the delivery, the effects work. It’s in the texture of the film grain. Oblivion is like those blu-ray restorations of classic films. It pushes visual quality as far as it possibly can, which thanks to the more malleable medium of video games means recreating the project’s “exterior” in a brand new engine. But beneath that shell, Oblivion is unmistakably a product of the 2000s. Alex Murphy, executive producer at Virtuos, had the perfect analogy during the reveal stream: "We think of the Oblivion game engine as the brain and Unreal 5 as the body. The brain drives all the world logic and gameplay and the body brings to life the experience that players have loved for almost 20 years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered is exactly what it says it is, and that shouldn’t be seen as downplaying its achievements. Instead of insisting that it's a remake, we should actually be using it as the quality bar by which we judge remasters from other titan-scale AAA companies. This is what Mass Effect Legendary Edition should have been, rather than a cleaned-up re-release. This is what Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy should have been rather than an incredibly cynical-feeling cash grab. Because there’s nothing cynical about Oblivion Remastered. It looks like a remake crafted by passionate hands but plays like a remaster preserved by loving fans, and that’s exactly how it should be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A few hours ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1915889058024222801/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered has surpassed 4 million players in its first four days since <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its launch on April 22</a>. It's undoubtedly an excellent early result, albeit not an unexpected one. Oblivion was, after all, already a very popular game in its time, selling three million units in less than a year. Of course, this remaster has the advantage of being included with Game Pass, where PC and Xbox users with an active subscription can access it without paying an additional fee.</p>
<p>The marketing strategy might have worked in its favor, too. While Bethesda kept absolute silence <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until April 21</a>, when they told fans to connect the following day to watch the full unveiling, there had been leaks and rumors since early 2025, and a few insiders had already correctly anticipated that it would be shadowdropped at some point in April. By the time the game launched on Tuesday, there was already intense anticipation among Elder Scrolls fans, essentially without any effort from Bethesda.</p>
<p>Elder Scrolls games have always had very long legs, thanks to the official support of Bethesda and the unofficial support of the legion of modders who still work hard on games like Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. Oblivion Remastered likely won't get any more official content (though a few performance patches would definitely be welcome to improve the open world stuttering). Still, despite some limitations, the modding community is already hard at work, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are already hundreds of mods on Nexus</a>.</p>
<p>The game is unique because its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, and its game logic is on the original Gamebryo engine. This makes it a bit more challenging to mod than the original game, as explained <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Nexus website</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The core data for the game is still loaded from the plugin files, as with the original games; however, each game object (record) in the plugins is mapped from Oblivion Engine to Unreal Engine using JSON. This means that the traditional methods of detecting conflicts may not work anymore. </em></li>
<li><em>When adding new content to the game, the JSON data for this content would need to be inserted. </em></li>
<li><em>The JSON structures for many game objects include additional values that did not exist in the original game, and the purpose of them is currently unclear. </em></li>
<li><em>Any text that is added to the game via plugins seems to show up with an "[NL]" prefix, which is currently thought to mean "Not Localised". Investigations are ongoing to work out how to make mods that don't have this prefix. </em></li>
<li><em>The new Unreal Engine versions of the textures, models, particles and animation files appear to still be linked to the original version in some cases. </em></li>
<li><em>The Level of Detail (LOD) for this game appears to use a completely new system, most likely heavily controlled by the Unreal Engine side of the game. </em></li>
<li><em>The game uses several scripting languages across different systems, including an updated version of OBScript, Unreal Engine Code, and Unreal Engine Blueprints.</em></li>
<li><em>Concerning a possible script extender for the game (equivalent to xOBSE), there is a challenge of the Creation Engine script extender devs being unfamiliar with Unreal Engine and Unreal Engine modding being unfamiliar with Creation Engine script extenders.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, these challenges aren't nearly enough to deter modders. Some of them have already paused their ongoing work on Skyrim to tinker with Oblivion Remastered. A lot of reverse engineering will have to be done, but the Bethesda modding community has already achieved the impossible with Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, extending their feature sets well beyond the original games' scope. We'll keep an eye on any noteworthy developments within the scene.</p>
