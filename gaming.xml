            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/sony-confirm-the-55-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-for-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the full list of games that will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced when the mid-generation high-powered console launches later this week. While many were already known, it’s now fully confirmed that 55 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> games will take advantage of the PS5 Pro hardware.</p>
<p>What Sony has not detailed is the specific enhancements that each game is using. The PS5 Pro can be used in a number of ways, with Sony talking up the ability to combine the commonly seen 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes on PS5, giving Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates. Alternatively, developers could lean in on using the beefier GPU to push ray traced graphics. And across the board, games can use PSSR for hardware upscaling that’s of a higher quality than FSR 2.</p>


<p>But again, all of this will be on a game-by-game basis and used in different ways by different developers.</p>
<p>Here’s the 55 games that will be enhanced on day one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-1-6-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing.1026888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for Lords of the Fallen is launching today, thanks to creators CI Games and HEXWORKS. With this update comes a brand new tutorial, updates to the Umbral system, and some gameplay balancing to provide a smoother experience for those who are getting stuck into the game. In addition, Update 1.6 for Lords of the Fallen adds the PS5 Pro enhancement update, which provides a ton of graphical improvements for those who plan on picking up the game. One of the most critical parts of the update, other than the graphical improvements, is the enhanced onboarding and tutorial experience, which is provided to newcomers after they receive feedback from veteran players.</p>
<p>With the gameplay and performance enhancements for the PS5 Pro, it adds a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode that means the game will run at 4K60 based on 1440p, and the Quality Mode will run at a native 4K30. The nitty-gritty of these enhancements was already covered prior and you can read all of that info on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate this major update, the standard version of Lords of the Fallen will be on a 50% discount on Steam from 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT through to November 11, costing $29.99. As stated above, the onboarding system is now a lot more gradual and kinder to allow players to get used to the ebb and flow of Lords of the Fallen. This includes the Umbral Lamp capabilities, as well as better navigation through the tutorial area, which previously was tripping players up and made it difficult to get to grips with the traversal system.</p>
<p>One of the most highly requested features for this update was to give players more time to thoroughly explore Umbral, the second realm that you could hop into and explore, which ran alongside the core world. There have been some changes to Umbral to make it a bit more accessible overall, which includes making the soundscapes subtler, as well as adjustments to the enemy spawn curve to improve the overall pacing of the secondary realm and a reduced vignette effect, which was previously quite significant and could smother some of the details of the Umbral Realm.</p>
<p>This update for Lords of the Fallen is available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 and will be available for the PS5 Pro as of November 7, with the all-new graphical enhancements as listed in their announcement.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the patch notes' nitty-gritty and what else was changed besides these significant factors, they have uploaded the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch notes</a>, which tell you what you can expect from Lords of the Fallen now in update 1.6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/discussing-queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-standalone-expansion-new-princesses<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess"><em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>, a deckbuilding card game from designer Kyle Shire and publisher Darrington Press, they’re back again for a standalone that doubles as an expansion; <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02324209-a2e3-4a29-9940-d2c9418e30b1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems"><em>Queen By Midnight: Quarter Past</em></a>. Last week we got to sit down with Shire and Alex Uboldi, Game Production Manager at Darrington Press, to talk about the new expansion including the new playable Princesses, how they balanced each character, and whether any more ideas are bouncing around in Shire’s Head.</p>

<p>Before hopping into the interview it’s important to explain that <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is a deckbuilding game where players take on the role of Princesses fighting for a chance to become Queen. Spend Clout to purchase cards from your character deck, or the shared bazaar, to build up your strength and defeat all of the other princesses before the clock strikes midnight.</p>

<h2>The Inception And Collaboration Behind <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></h2>

<p>To begin our interview Shire introduced himself and the history of development for<em> Queen By Midnight.</em> “The TLDR is wayback in the day I had this weird idea for a card game that I had kicking around for a very long time. I was working full time for a company that rhymes with shmeshminima and didn’t really think anything was going to come from [<em>Queen By Midnight]</em> and when shmeshminima went shmesmwaway I had a bunch of time on my hands and I needed to fill it with something to do. This game became my reason to get out of bed in the morning for the longest time.”</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//y8Vj_uhNKPA"></iframe></p>

<p>After some time, and returning to work, Shire explained that he had continued to work on it behind the scenes until the creation of Darrington Press as the game publishing arm of Critical Role was created. “Darrington Press came along I pitched it to Ivan and thank got someone as talented and wonderful as Alex Uboldi came along and managed to fish all of the good threads out of my tangled mess and managed to make a really great game, and now another one.”</p>

<p>Uboldi hopped in to offer his side of this meeting “When I started at Darrington Press one of the first projects that was handed to me was the original <em>Queen By Midnight</em>. I took it and I played it with a bunch of different groups and every group I played it with loved the game”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every group I played it with loved the game so I’m like ‘Ok, there’s something special here’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was a lot of my job to basically help develop the art, the graphic design, go through all of the cards and make sure there was consistency,” Alex spoke further on his input to the creation of the finished product that we know today. “Basically it was bringing Kyle’s vision to life in the most beautiful way possible.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=ouBHUQCt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=sIy4lBGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Quarter Past</em> sitting next to the base game of <em>Queen By Midnight</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Reception Worthy Of A Queen</h2>

<p>I asked Shire what it was like having that game, that he was working on in the backburner become such a success, he said “It’s been a dream come true. Any single time I am able to go into a game store and see my game, and talk to game store owners and people playing it, and get their feedback there’s no greater feeling.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love hearing all the stories of people saying ‘I won with this character, and I really want to try these other characters’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shire and Uboldi shared a common appreciation of hearing peoples stories of winning the game. Whether it be a slow burn through the game, taking out specific Princesses immediately, or using an ability to steal everyone’s Clout etc.</p>

<p>Uboldi admitted “Those stories of people playing the game, that’s why I really do this.”</p>

<h2>How To Build A Princess</h2>

<p>When Shire brought the game to Uboldi and the Darrington Press team he already had a lot of ideas for the Princesses, how they would perform uniquely, and what kind of personality they would have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=M0jQriZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=VjnhS9aK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Azil With A Z is a new Princess for <em>Quarter Past</em></figcaption></figure><p>“We did a lot of working together to make sure the Princesses felt like they were their identities, they developed in cool and interesting ways. Neither of us expected as we were bouncing ideas off each other that these Princesses would develop into fully fledged characters that both of us are happy with.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the expansion Uboldi explained that the process was very similar “We wanted to make the expansion for this game because we love this world and we want to see more from it. Kyle laid out all of the design for the four new pricesses.” At that time Shire already had ideas for the vibes of each of these new Princesses as well as their mechanics to make them a unique play experience at the table.</p>



<p>Four new Princesses have been added as part of <em>Quarter Past</em>; Elise LeKraken, Azil With A Z, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar.</p>

<p>Talking on the inspirations for these characters Shire explained that "if Ursula is to Devine, then you will have Elise LeKraken to Monet X Change. Dialing back to the original conceit behind Ursula and making that the focal point for our mermaid princess is just absolutely inspired."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more on the mechanics and gameplay style for each of these new Princesses you can check out our full review of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Azil With A Z is our wonderful nod to Alice in Wonderland. Our absurdist and surreal princess. Her whole vibe is that she's the only princess who has access to all three classes. I always tell people that she's the chaos character, if you're not interested in winning but want to cause a bunch of chaos you've got to play Azil."</p>

<p>Uboldi continued describing the characters talking about Qasima Al-Basar "who is our Princess Jasmine meeds Aladdin analog. By day she's a princess and by night she's a vigilante who protects her kingdom personally. We wanted to create a character who felt like she hed a lot of tools for espionage, but if she needs to she doles out great damage."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=4FAHv1II 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=tEXcy-me 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Princess has their own unique deck and playstyle</figcaption></figure><p>The last of the new characters is Kahurere Skyfisher who doesn't want to be Queen, but she wants to bring the whole system down. "She is Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia meets Moana. Because she doesn't have this grand kingdom she has to use more covert means. Her mechanic is laying traps for all the other Princesses. They can either keep the traps in their hand to be a dead card or play the trap to draw another card, but the trap will do something to help Skyfisher"</p>

<p>This deck is all about the other players making choices to have benefits together, or working against one another. Uboldi explained that what drew him to liking this character was that it's very "Interactive. It lets you talk to the whole table and it involves everyone and that's where the game is it's most fun"</p>

<p>While all four of these characters have their own unique mechanics Shire did explain that they designed each to be a far more aggressive character, making big moves quickly.</p>

<h2>There Might Be Two Lost Princesses?</h2>

<p>Interestingly when talking about how he came up with the original concepts for the Princesses that the first game would have twelve Princesses. "So I had cooked up rough ideas for 12 princesses, eventually I thought it was madness and cut it down to six that I felt like were the six most well baked out of them."</p>

<p>From the other six they were included in Shire's original draft of the first game for potential expansions and four of those are what we can now play. When asked if we would see these two final Princesses Shire said "I don't know, we'll have to figure that out, I have an idea but we'll see…" as Uboldi shrugged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=h3MVrdxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=yACaCTQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the full clocktower <em>Quarter Past</em> tracks the game with this more portable alternative</figcaption></figure><h2>Creating Balance Across The Lands</h2>

<p>As each Princess has their own unique deck and you can now play with up to ten Princesses I was curious to understand how they approached balancing so many characters. Having already created the prior six helped them have a good baseline. Uboldi explained that "We looked at the original princesses and the baseline power level. We scaled everything to match that power level, but because we were making these changes to the core deck it changes the dynamic of these princesses to be much more aggressive."</p>

<p>By not having the ability to block an attack, it allowed them to design the pricesses to be more aggressive knowing that they're also more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>"Against each other they felt very balanced, but against the Core Set Princesses there was interesting gameplay for the Princesses who are holding off an assault and trying to go over the top or Princesses who are trying to race down their opponents."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=vni-9QJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=6ECpO2BL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This expansion also contains errata cards for the base version so you can play it in it's 'best' form</figcaption></figure><h2>Expansion As Well As Standalone</h2>

<p>Many board games when expanding a roster of playable characters would simply release a character expansion and move on. For <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> I was impressed that not only was this four new playable characters that interact with one another but that it came with all that that you need to play it on it's own.</p>

<p>Uboldi explained that for Darrington Press they understood that the base game retailing at $70 that was a high price point for something you might not like. "We designed <em>Quarter Past</em> as a great entry place for newer players"</p>

<p>"We really wanted it to work well on it's own, we even designed the Princesses and Bazaar cards to be simpler but mechanically deep to make this as approachable for a new entry player as possible."</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/twitch-introduces-mandatory-politics-and-sensitive-social-issues-label-just-in-time-for-the-us-election</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-introduce-mandatory-politics-and-sensitive-social-issues-label-just-in-time-for-the-us-election.1026873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/twitch-introduces-mandatory-politics-and-sensitive-social-issues-label-just-in-time-for-the-us-election<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>It "could bring new advertisers to our service"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Twitch have <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">introduced</a> a new "Politics and Sensitive Social Issues" label for streams that "focus" on topics like "elections, civic integrity, and war or military conflict". As with the streaming giant's existing labels for M-rated material, sexual themes or depictions of gambling, the idea is that viewers can filter out such streams in advance by altering their settings.</p>
<p>Advertisers, similarly, can "make better choices about the content they want to advertise next to" - in other words, pull their ads from a whole swathe of material if they don't want to be associated with anything controversial. Twitch's hope is that "the labels will allow advertisers to have more context to inform which types of streams they show their ads alongside, which we expect to increase brands’ confidence in running ads on Twitch, and could bring new advertisers to our service."</p> <!--more-->
<p>Streamers who fail to use the label appropriately will receive email warnings and eventually, have their accounts suspended. Twitch may also intervene to apply labels without the streamer's say-so.
</p>
<p>
The measures were <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Update-on-CCL-for-Politics-and-Sensitive-Social-Issues?language=en_US">announced on 1st November</a>, and seem obviously timed to control the circulation of polemics during the US presidential elections on 5th November. The post above links to <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">a longer but far from complete breakdown of the new content category</a> - here are some examples of streams that will need the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label in future:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies
</p>
<p>
Live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes
</p>
<p>
Livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies
</p>
<p>
Discussing military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters
</p>
<p>
Discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion
</p>
<p>
Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As for what doesn't require a label, Twitch are fine with "streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate. For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote." They're also OK with "intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues".
</p><p>
As many Twitch users have <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1852370050335887512">pointed out on social media</a>, all these designations are quite blurry and therefore, <a href="https://x.com/MoonlightBVT/status/1852856903875100985">easy to twist and weaponise</a> against vulnerable groups. What does "intermittent" mean, exactly, as a proportion of total streaming time? Does "sharing knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner" become "advocacy" when the facts presented lead to certain conclusions? 
</p>
<p>
The ambiguity leaves the new category open to bad-faith reporting. The requirement to categorise "political" streams so people and advertisers can avoid them might also have a chilling effect on discussion of political narratives and themes in video games. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, for example, makes diversity a cornerstone of its writing, but a streamer discussing that would presumably risk having their streams labelled political and so, losing access to a chunk of potential viewers and ad revenue.

<p>In my review of Black Ops 6, I said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From a long and entertaining campaign to a stacked and solid multiplayer platform that feels refreshingly modern and well-built, to the round-based Zombies offering and the promise of a decent roadmap, there’s nothing about Black Ops 6 that turns me off. If I had to put a number against this Black Ops 6 review, it would be a 9 out of 10.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been more than a week since Black Ops 6 was released, and it has proven to be the most successful Call of Duty launch in history. Have you played it yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Taking part in a deckbuilding battle royale where the victor walks away the titular Queen By Midnight this game showed off unique mechanics and a gorgeous cardboard craft clock that serves not only as an impressive setpiece but manages core game mechanics. Now with the standalone expansion, Queen By Midnight Quarter Past, four new Princesses join the fray.</p>



<p>Contained within the box of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> you'll find complete instructions for how to play the game (including boxes that specify what's new in this edition), a flat clock for turn tracking, boards and tokens for each of the four Princesses, specific decks for each Princess, and a deck of Bazaar cards broken up into three time segments.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=Zq-p2lpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=oPzJKEbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you have played <em>Queen By Midnight</em>, then setting up and playing the game will come as no surprise. Players each pick which of the Princesses they wish to play as, gathering up the relevant character board and deck. Then, the clock is laid out and set up with Bazaar cards. Once everyone is ready you roll the dice to see who goes first and begin playing your cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in the original game the clock was a massive structure that doubled as a dice tower that you would build and place on a spinning platform the clock included in Quarter Past is a flat clock. While less intricate it does promote the idea of Quarter Past functioning as a 'travel' version of the game, while the larger box can stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A quick gameplay overview</h2>

<p>Working to develop their decks players will use cards to increase their Clout, the primary currency in the game, and purchase new cards. Cards can be purchased from a Princesses specific Vault, which will contain abilities unique to the Princess, or they can be purchased from the Bazaar which offers a more generic, but useful nonetheless, variety of abilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Each newly purchased card is sent to the Archive, this game's equivalent of a graveyard, when it will be shuffled back into their deck to then be used against other Princesses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=64-l8yI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=kMf9E-a6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a constant balance of spending and regaining Clout, as your deck grows in size you'll quickly learn you can't just be spending Clout freely as your ability to regain it will return less and less frequently. Alternatively, leaving too much Clout on your board does leave it in a place where it can get stolen by another's card effects.</p>

<p>The deckbuilding alone is a lot of fun but after each player has completed a turn the clock will increment by one. At certain key times, like 5 o'clock or 8 O'Clock important events can happen such as the Bazaar cards being swapped out for a deck filled with more powerful abilities, or the hand size limit is increased.</p>

<p>The game ultimately ends after the clock reaches 12, or if only one competing Princess remains. This does a good job to keep a cap on the events of the game and to limit just how much power creep can occur.</p>

<h2>Drawing At The Start Slows The Game Down</h2>

<p>One of the largest issues that I've found with <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is that as long as you have clout you can be activating cards, in most scenarios, especially in the early game you'll be spending down your entire hand before the end of your turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=QXDKF-Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=KrnB9LHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at the table with nothing in your hand isn't anything I have an issue with, but not knowing what I'm going to draw next will mean I have no clue what any of my options are for next turn.</p>

<p>At the start of each player's turn momentum always slows. A fresh hand of cards are drawn, effects are read, Clout is increased, and the six purchasable cards may be reviewed.</p>

<p>This will mean that unless you're playing with a group that knows their Princesses' abilities inside and out that you are limited in how much time you can be strategizing, or you leave the table waiting on you for your move (while they too have no clue what they're going to do next).</p>

<h2>The new Princesses and their abilities</h2>

<p>As the name implies <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> sees four new Princesses joining. This expansion includes Azil With-A-Z, Elise LaKraken, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar. Each comes with their own unique mechanics and playstyle that let you mix and match against other players for strange situations.</p>

<p>Azil With-A-Z is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, with the ability to Shrink and Grow. By changing her size she also alters one of her Classes between Brawler and Schemer. Her abilities are incredibly strong, but as you can only perform certain abilities when a certain class you can also end up being stuck unable to deal damage.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing with Azil, there's an important aspect of needing to plan your moves as far out as you can. If an ability would deal damage, but then cause you to shrink, what can you then do in that state? Do you have a way to grow again? It was very satisfying when everything fell into place.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=RsOFrZ3q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-mechanic.jpg?itok=kEjbZ7hI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Elise LeKraken is a Schemer/Caster character whose core mechanic is to banish her own cards. This would all be a power play to then unleash ultimate abilities near the end of the game to flip the game in her favour.</p>

<p>It was interesting that LeKraken worked almost as a sleeper character, but knowing her mechanics and targeting her early could also be an easy downfall depending on the number of players and how dedicated they were to knocking competition out of the game.</p>

<p>Kahurere Skyfisher is a Brawler/Schemer whose mechanic is in traps. She has a variety of cards that can be placed in other players Archives. When activated those cards might gain a benefit to the Princess, such as getting to draw a card, but it will also provide a boon to Skyfisher.</p>

<p>Whether it be ways to steal Clout or also be able to draw a card there's a lot of good that can be done for Skyfisher on another player's turn, not to mention the inclusion of a card like this is their deck might mean it takes them longer to draw a card they're actually interested in getting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=LXzowDwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks.jpg?itok=hy1Clj8u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Strangely the card we saw the most from the Skyfisher was to be able to steal 4 Clout. This is a large amount of Clout to be able to freely obtain, but when early turns comprise of gaining a lot of Clout and then spending it down to zero we most often ended up in situations where there wasn't any Clout to steal effectively rendering that card useless.</p>

<p>If Elise LeKraken is a sleeper the opposite of that is Qasima Al-Basar, the Brawler/Caster. This character doesn't start extremely strong but with some smart purchases will not only be dealing consistent damage, but will also grant themselves permanent damage boosts. A hit of three or four damage might not be much early on, but when the pace doesn't even stop but she's now hitting with eight damage you're going to be in trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have a narrower range of effectiveness the engine that is driving each of these decks is wildly different and a lot of fun. Further fleshing out the availability from the previously released Princesses the idea of "there's a playstyle for any kind of deckbuilding player" is even more true than before.</p>

<p>I think one of the best compliments I can give for the game is that it feels like getting to play Magic The Gathering, without the need to build a deck and strategy from the ground up. That being said there's still a lot of building as you weigh up purchasing cards from the Vault and Bazaar.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=MCDxU0T3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock.jpg?itok=fj-TT5O7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Is <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past </em>Standalone or an Expansion?</h2>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Everything included in the box allows you to play <em>Queen By Midnight</em> from start to finish with four players. As an expansion though all of the Princesses available in this box can be played with any of the six previously available Princesses.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have issues when facing off against Azil, it might be that there's another Princess that she has a definite advantage against.</p>

<p>To add further to this being an expansion Errata Cards for the base game have also been included in this update. These cards should be swapped out with cards that appear in the base game to better balance the experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=1eMfS_EL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards.jpg?itok=ddiZcdNm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I genuinely enjoyed the original game when I played it so I was excited to hear that there would be an expansion. The triple versatility allowing it to add more characters for fans of the base game, be a smaller entry point for new players, and even serve as a way to send updated cards allows it to achieve it's goal perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the four new Princesses I'm a little iffy on Skyfisher, but had a blast seeing what the other three were able to accomplish.</p>

<p>If you were a fan of the original game then this expansion is a no brainer, and if you don't know the original but are looking for a fun and deep deckbuilder where the game naturally scales as time goes on then I'd highly recommend checking this out.</p>

<p>Redditor Dale Robinson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/i_solved_the_sh2_remake_photos_secret/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a lengthy post yesterday</a> detailing all the steps he took to solve the puzzle. I don't wish to spoil the steps just in case you want to discover it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you'll need a healthy dose of lateral thinking if you do.</p>

<p>Robinson's efforts were <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lauded on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>director Mateusz Lenart, who said he "knew it wouldn't stay hidden for long" and congratulated Robinson for solving the brain-teaser, suggesting that the "timing couldn't be better". Again, that post contains puzzle spoilers, so click at your peril.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unaware, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is, believe it or not, a reimagined version of the original 2002 survival horror classic. While the original game was created by Konami, this one's been developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team, with Konami serving as publisher.</p>

<p>The game hews fairly closely to the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s story, but it features a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, as well as extra story elements and quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>The game proved popular with both critics and fans, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m">a million copies within its first three days</a> on sale, although that didn't stop <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked">Wikipedia trolls from trying to edit the game's page</a> to suggest it had received much lower scores than it actually did.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-goes-all-in-on-generative-ai-for-gaming-appoints-dedicated-vp.1026825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has appointed a VP (vice president) of generative AI within its gaming division, indicating that the tech giant is serious about the controversial technology when it comes to video games.</p>

<p>The VP in question is none other than Mike Verdu, who confirmed the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via his LinkedIn page</a>. Verdu says his new role at Netflix is to drive "a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI".</p>

<p>Previously, Verdu worked as Netflix's overall games VP, but that role will now be filled by Alain Tascan, who Verdu says is "already in the process of taking Netflix Games in exciting new directions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=pPu8zuXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=cjQSaYPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix has appointed a VP to handle generative AI for its gaming division.</figcaption></figure><p>Verdu says that generative AI represents a return to "seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innvoation" in gaming, expressing excitement he says he hasn't felt "since the 90s".</p>

<p>He also exhorts readers to "pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media" about recent changes to Netflix Games, presumably referring to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report">reported closure</a> of Netflix's in-house AAA development studio, codenamed Team Blue.</p>

<p>According to Verdu, everything that's happened within Netflix Games in the last several months "was actually a planned transition", suggesting that the closure of Team Blue wasn't a kneejerk response but a carefully-considered decision.</p>

<p>The vision for generative AI at Netflix, according to Verdu, is one that "puts creative talent at the center", uses AI as "a catalyst and an accelerant", and enables big development teams to "move much faster".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=hcGzR3dw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=IiC-FpfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, like Ubisoft, are also leaning into generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>The topic of generative AI is a controversial one in the gaming world (and, indeed, the rest of the world) right now.</p>

<p>Proponents like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation">Nihon Falcom</a>, and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>&nbsp;tout the potential benefits of the technology and seem enthusiastic about the ways in which they believe it could change the gaming landscape, but there are certainly no shortage of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans">ambivalent</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai">skeptical voices</a> in the industry on this front.</p>

<p>In any case, we don't know exactly how Verdu and Netflix intend to use generative AI, so we'll likely have to wait until a major project from the company is announced in order to learn more. Stay tuned!</p>

In these early days, the most popular on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a> revolve around performance improvements on PC and various character presets, and there’s even one that strips the purple from the game to make it look more like a dark fantasy RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the latter. Vktrfly’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/11" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Fantasy Look-Up Table</a> (LUT) mod is a reshade that aims to remove the purple/magenta elements from the game and give it “a darker, more atmospheric look.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-before-1730725760094.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Age: The Veilguard in original form.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-after-1730726241106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vktrfly’s Dark Fantasy LUT mod enabled.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since BioWare unveiled The Veilguard gameplay, fans have debated its art style, with some lamenting the developer’s decision to go for a heavily stylized, almost cartoony look compared to the more gritty, realistic prior games in the series. The Veilguard, with its smooth, purple-hued visuals, is certainly at the opposite end of the Dragon Age art style spectrum, with 2009’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a> heavy on mud and blood-drenched medieval fantasy, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a> occupying a place somewhere in-between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the most popular mod so far is ChemBoy1’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anti-Stutter - Performance Enhancer - High CPU and Disk Priority - DATV mod</a>, which enables high CPU and disk priority for the Dragon Age: The Veilguard executable. This can help with performance on weaker CPUs and slower disks, and helps reduce stuttering on all CPU and disks, ChemBoy1 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also high on the most downloaded mods list is Nyctaginae’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonagetheveilguard/mods/12" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preset and sliders for their Rook</a> (Veilguard’s customizable main character), Ayse de Riva, a female mage and elf Antivan Crow (“Based on my OC of 15+ years, hope you like her!”).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/04/da-again-1730725905246.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nyctaginae’s Ayse de Riva mod for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect more elaborate mods to release as modders get to grips with The Veilguard. We’ve seen the likes of Larian and CD Projekt release official mod tools for Baldur’s Gate 3 and The Witcher 3 respectively, which have unlocked an explosion in each game’s modding scene. Perhaps at some point down the line, BioWare will do the same for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that might be important in keeping the game alive, given BioWare has indicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">it has no plans to release DLC for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, with the developer now turning its attention to Mass Effect 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, fans are busy digging into BioWare's latest RPG after Dragon Age's release on Thursday, propelling it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam"><u>new highs for an EA game on Steam</u></a>. They have plenty to find even without DLC — estimates on <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/82090" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN sister site HowLongToBeat</u></a> suggest that it can take upwards of 88 hours to complete the main story while doing sidequests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Major_Choices_and_Consequences"><u>major choices in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> as well as our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Romance_Guide"><u>complete romance guide</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>Further performance and gameplay enhancements, PlayStation 5 Pro support, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > CI Games [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ci-games">CI Games</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Hexworks [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ci-games/hexworks">Hexworks</a> have released the version 1.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Lords of the Fallen (2023) [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2023">Lords of the Fallen</a></em>, which delivers an enhanced onboarding and tutorial experience based on feedback from experienced players, as well as <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,303 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> Pro support. <span id="more-925760"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via CI Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Version 1.6 Patch Notes</strong></p><p><strong>Gameplay Improvements</strong></p><p>We’ve implemented further gameplay adjustments informed by community feedback and extensive playtesting. It’s rewarding to see our Steam “Recent Review” score rising, reflecting the positive impact of these ongoing improvements, and we’re committed to continuing this journey with your valuable input.</p><p>Highlights include:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Mob Density</strong> – Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed via NG+ modifiers.)</li><li><strong>Ranged Enemies</strong> – We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li><li>Jumping – Platforming in Pilgrim’s Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li><li><strong>Player-Versus-Player Scaling</strong> – To elevate skill-based play in player-versus-player, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics, particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply exclusively to player-versus-player, so player-versus-environment players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li><li><strong>Attack Displacement</strong> – Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and supporting your playstyle.</li></ul><p><strong><a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Tutorialisation, Onboarding, and Start-Up <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong></p><p>We’ve taken steps to further enrich the onboarding experience for new players in <em>Lords of the Fallen</em>, building on feedback from our veteran Lampbearers. We want every new player to feel empowered on their journey, and we understand that some early tutorials may have presented a steep learning curve. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul><li><strong>Improved Lighting in the Defiled Sepulchre</strong> – Enhanced lighting and visual adjustments make this initial tutorial area clearer and easier to navigate.</li><li><strong>Gradual Umbral Tutorialization</strong> – Core abilities like “soulflay” and “syphoning” now have dedicated tutorial spaces later in Redcopse, allowing new players to engage with each feature more gradually.</li><li><strong>Simplified First Jump Tutorial</strong> – We’ve refined the jump tutorial to be more accessible (hands up in the comments if you cleared it on the first attempt!).</li><li><strong>Lightreaper Boss Adjustment in NG0</strong> – To clarify the intentional design of this encounter, we’ve removed the Lightreaper boss fight from the tutorial area for NG0 players. Rest assured: the Lightreaper still lurks within Mournstead and will make a return as a surprise in NG+.</li></ul><p><strong>A More Immersive Umbral Realm for Explorers</strong></p><p>Umbral, the parallel realm intertwined with the living world of Axiom, is accessible at any point in the game, offering an expansive world of alternate pathways, hidden treasures, and secrets. We know how much you enjoy exploring Mournstead, and many of you have asked for a more exploration-friendly Umbral realm. Embracing this idea, we’ve made some tweaks to enhance its immersive vibe while preserving its mysterious, challenging nature.</p><p>While Umbral remains intentionally hostile, we’ve made adjustments to its sounds, visuals, and enemy spawn curve. Now, the threads (Umbral natives) are slower to detect your presence, allowing you some precious time to explore before the realm’s haunting intensifies. Eventually, the Scarlet Shadow will appear, forcing you to decide: escape or engage in an epic showdown.</p><p>These changes make Umbral better suited for exploration while preserving its eerie intensity and challenging atmosphere:</p><ul><li><strong>Dynamic Ambient Sound</strong> – Initial entry into Umbral is now accompanied by subtler soundscapes, building in intensity as you remain longer, reaching a crescendo before you must find an exit, or risk facing the <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>son Reaper.</li><li><strong>Adjusted Enemy Spawn Curve</strong> – Enemy appearances are now better paced to create a smoother, gradual build-up of tension.</li><li><strong>Increased Delay for Scarlet Shadow</strong> – You’ll now have more time to explore before the Scarlet Shadow emerges, enhancing the suspense.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vignette Effect</strong> – Based on player feedback, the vignette effect has been softened to improve visibility while exploring Umbral.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>rer Umbral Eggs</strong> – We’ve added a special VFX to eggs set to spawn Umbral natives, as we noticed some players had difficulty distinguishing between active and inactive ones.</li></ul><p>These updates create a richer exploration experience within Umbral, preserving its dark allure and escalating tension for daring <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,849 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs.</p><p><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p>We’ve implemented additional performance enhancements across several of the game’s more graphically demanding areas, optimizing the experience for players with lower-spec computers.</p><p><strong>New Challengers Incoming!</strong></p><p>With <em>Lords of the Fallen</em> now fully harnessing the power of the PlayStation 5 Pro (with an enhanced Performance Mode running at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second based on 1440p, and Quality Mode running at a native 4K resolution and 30 frames per second), prepare for a fresh wave of cross-players venturing into Mournstead! Be sure to welcome them—whether with a warm salute in cooperative play or the cold edge of your blade in player-versus-player.</p></blockquote><p><em>Lords of the Fallen</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,346 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,625 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/The_Lords_of_the_Fallen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/lords-of-the-fallen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The early years of Assassin's Creed saw players explore both the past and the modern day through its protagonist Desmond Miles, and while recent games have focused less on the person inside the Animus, Ubisoft plans to address that in the future.</p><p>In a recent interview, Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté reflected on how recent games struggled to create a meaningful connection between the past and the future. In the context of Assassin's Creed, ancient history is recreated through the Animus, a virtual-reality machine that taps into a subject's DNA and allows them to experience the genetically inherited memories of an ancestor. At the center of this idea was Desmond Miles, who entered the Animus and became a narrative anchor point for the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Real History of Assassin's Creed | The Real Assassin's Order</p>
      </div>
<p>"Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern-day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artifacts--Pieces of Eden--that could change the course of history," Coté said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. "Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."</p><p>To address this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will lay the groundwork for the future of the series, as it'll be integrated inside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-everything-we-know-about-ubisoft-game-hub/1100-6503702/" data-ref-id="1100-6503702">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, a hub presented as an in-universe Animus that will host the ongoing modern-day narrative. Coté explained that this will allow the contemporary storyline to "enhance" rather than overshadow the historical journey, creating a "meaningful contrast between past and present" that will focus on how the past shapes the present and themes of freedom versus control.</p><p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come," Coté said.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to February 14, 2025</a>. Ubisoft said at the time that the delay was made to give the developers more time to polish the game, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-assassins-creed-shadows-early-access/1100-6527307/" data-ref-id="1100-6527307">Assassin's Creed Shadows' early access has also been canceled</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer Hexworks has shared details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>'s PS5 Pro update.</p>
<p>As with games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>, Lords of the Fallen will benefit from that 'Enhanced' label on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro's release this week</a>.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen's case, this will see a 40 percent increase in pixel density. In addition, it will boast an enhanced Performance Mode, which means 1440p at 60fps (Upscaled to 4k). Quality Mode, meanwhile, will offer players 30fps at 4k.</p>

<p>As well as getting its game ready for the PS5 Pro, Hexworks has also released a patch for the base game. Patch 1.6 - as it is known - will include gameplay adjustments, steps to "further enrich the onboarding experience for new players" and a "more immersive" Umbral Realm, to name a few.</p>
<p>Hexworks specifically highlighted the below improvements, which arrive with Patch 1.6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mob Density: </strong>Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a  smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from  stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few  fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed  via NG+ modifiers.)</li>
<li><strong>Ranged Enemies: </strong>We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct  instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>Jumping: </strong>Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making  jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li>
<li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics,  particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply  exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Displacement: </strong>Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce  displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and  supporting your playstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the team has said performance will be improved in some of Lords of the Fallen's more graphically challenging areas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a> criticised the game for its poor performance, but the developer has been steadily offering improvements on this.</p><p>Today's patch will leave players feeling more "empowered" on their journey, Hexworks said. Full notes can be found via <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements">Steam</a>. Lords of the Fallen is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTFv1.6&amp;utm_id=Lords+of+the+Fallen+v1.6">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lords-of-the-fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a> from this Thursday.</p>

<p>As for the further future, earlier this year, it was revealed that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-now-in-full-development">follow-up to Lords of the Fallen is fully underway</a>. The sequel is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-set-for-2026">targeting a 2026 release</a>.</p></div>

Alien abductions are still taking place in Los Santos, and you're going want to be among the abductees if you'd like to get a cool weapon. But players are going to need to act fast, because these visitors from another world won't be hanging around forever.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3335k2ok38135/escape-alien-abduction-in-gta-online-this-halloween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Games</a> announced the alien abduction for this year's Halloween events, and it's going on through November 6. That means the skies are still strange, and players who make it out alive can earn The Shocker, a non-lethal alien weapon that acts like a stun baton. The hard part, however, might be getting captured in the first place.</p><p>The first thing that you need to know is that the aliens only come out at night from 10 PM to 4 AM in the game world, and given GTA Online's fast movement of time, this means that there's only a 12-minute window to find a UFO ship and get under it. Another complication is that your vehicles will fail if they get too close to the UFOs, so plan accordingly.</p><p>If you've successfully pulled off the abduction, the next step is escape. Players will find themselves locked in a room under Fort Zancudo. That's where The Shocker can be found, but players still have to get out with their lives in order to keep it. Opening the exit requires some close examinations of the clues in the chamber. Fortunately, The Gaming Gorilla has shared a video that breaks down how to get out of the room before a lethal gas makes this a one-way trip.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44cHCm6FM08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44cHCm6FM08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you miss your opportunity to get abducted this year, it's likely that Rockstar will revisit the idea in time for Halloween 2025. But for now, you only have until Wednesday, November 6 to pull off what may be the spookiest mission in the game to date.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slitterhead-review.1026747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/slitterhead-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Slitterhead immediately grabbed headlines when it was first announced, in part thanks to the pedigree of the team at Bokeh Games. Headed up by Keiichiro Toyama, a legit legend of Japanese gaming having created not only Silent Hill but also the Siren and Gravity Rush series, and with Silent Hill stalwart Akira Yamaoka alongside for composition, you jad a survival horror dream team scenario. Details have been relatively sparse over the years, so I started my time with the game with a mixture of excitement and uncertainty. What even is Slitterhead? After finishing the game I’m still left with that question.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slitterhead - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EENlMq23sE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first thing that stands out is the game’s presentation. Slitterhead looks fantastic at times and offers up a neon-drenched and grubby analogue for Hong Kong that gave me flashbacks to the underrated Sleeping Dogs. However, it’s clear that this isn’t a big budget AAA game, and there’s some noticeable shortcuts. The most obvious is the vast number of doppelgangers running around Kow Long, making it feel like there’s only a handful of different NPCs. It gives the game an uncanny feeling that actually sort of works. Cutscenes are of a much higher standard, which leads to the kind of jarring transitions back to gameplay that characterised the Xbox 360 era. The game is accompanied by an interesting and varied soundtrack, with some unsettling drone and jazzy moments that stand out but do not overshadow the game itself.</p>


<p>The storyline is obscure and confusing in a deliberate way that perhaps speaks to the title’s ambition, but is left behind by its execution. You play as a mysterious spirit – the Hyoki – stranded in the game world with no memories (so far so generic). To survive you have to possess the bodies of those around you, controlling them through their blood. Such control is limited, and you are fragile and cumbersome. As you work through the early parts of the game you move from body to body before finding a Rarity – a human who can fully bond with you and unleash their full potential – with eight different</p>
<p>By the end of the game you’ll find up to eight different Rarities with unique skill sets and personalities. You find your first Rarity bleeding out after being attacked by the titular Slitterheads – grotesque monstrosities that also possess human bodies but burst out of their heads in varied horrific forms.</p>


<p>As the narrative develops you may find yourself asking a lot of questions about what is happening and why – I certainly was – but Slitterhead is not a game that offers easy answers. Much of the backstory is hidden behind collectable memory fragments and it later develops into a time hopping mechanic that makes following events even more confusing. This aspect is fine as it really feeds into the unsettling nature of the world and I enjoyed trying to piece things together. The ending of the game, however, proves to be perhaps the most headscratching part of all, but I’ll leave that for you to ponder on, if you give the game a try.</p>
<p>Equally puzzling is how the game plays. Slitterhead is much more like a fusion of&nbsp;visual novel and mission based action combat game than the survival horror title many were anticipating. Each of the Rarities has unique weapons and skills based on their personality and powered by their own blood. The end result of this is actually a more traditional set of character archetypes, but one that feels more original given the striking presentation and setting.</p>
<p>The first of your Rarities, Julee, is a healer, whilst the second, Alex, is more of a DPS warrior type. Once you have multiple Rarities available, you can take two into each mission, a move that opens up a range of choices and strategies to customise to your preferences. As well as the Rarities, you can still possess regular citizens in combat and juggling between the characters and maintaining their blood levels can lead to enjoyably frantic fights, at least for a while.</p>

<p>Between the static text conversation parts (for which there is a very disappointing lack of voice acting for 90% of the game) and arena fight set pieces you’ll be ‘exploring’ the city. This exploration is incredibly limited though and you’ll find yourself frustrated by the invisible walls and boundaries. Given that each mission has hidden collectables to find it is very counter-intuitive that the world is so restrictive with your character often refusing to leave the main path. These collectables are also only revealed after you complete the mission, so you don’t know whether you have found everything until you go back to the mission select screen. These decisions are echoes of gaming mechanics that I had hoped were left in the past.</p>
<p>Most annoying of all is the fact that several of the game’s Rarities are hidden throughout the missions and progress is locked until you find them. As you don’t know this is the case until you finish a mission in most cases, and the levels themselves are often linear paths that don’t really facilitate backtracking, you’re forced to replay missions until you find the Rarity and then unlock more boring, obtuse conversation trees.</p>
<p>The end result is one of frustration rather than excitement and I often rushed through missions the first time in the knowledge that I’d have to replay them again anyway knowing what I was looking for. Replaying missions doesn’t reward you with skill points to upgrade your character, which are only awarded the first time you finish a level, so you can’t even use these replays to grind. Even the creature design falls flat once you realise that there are only a handful of grotesque types endlessly repeated. Once you’ve fought off a few hundred anthropomorphic penises you start to lose interest…</p>

<p>Keiichiro Toyama has been open about the challenges of developing this game through engine choice to the effects of the Covid pandemic and I’m sensitive to the difficulties facing new studios, even when made up of superstar figures, but Slitterhead is a difficult game to fully recommend in its current form. It feels too much like the spirit of a game forced to possess a range of different types whilst trying to find itself.</p>

			<p>A stunning Unreal Engine 5.4 demo that is available for download for free shows how the engine can deliver some impressive realistic visuals.</p>
<p>The Rome demo by <a href="https://www.scansfactory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scans Factory</a>, which can be downloaded by going&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q6AxF2kcqoWwoWztzQ3Jpg0bmL96R51J/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is an incredible ultra-realistic recreation of the capital of Italy, complete with rain effects that allowed the team to create some impressive reflections with puddles. Despite not being an exact recreation of the city, having been to Rome over a dozen times, I can say that the demo does an excellent job depicting the city's unique vibe, possibly even enhancing it by removing the crowds and the confusion that often populate its streets. In case you cannot run the demo, you can check it out in action in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams.</a></p>

<p>Since the launch of the very first version of the engine back in 2022, Unreal Engine 5 has made some impressive strides that have improved it considerably. However, it has not addressed some of the biggest concerns, such as the stuttering issues that plague the vast majority of the games powered by Epic's latest engine, although version 5.4 did bring<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> significant CPU performance improvements.</a></p>
<p>While Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest public version of the engine, version 5.5 is in the works and already available in preview. This version of the engine introduces MegaLights, which allows developers to have a massive number of movable dynamic lights with realistic area shadows and more. More information on this version of the engine can be found <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/unreal-engine-5-5-preview/2048423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

			<p>With only three days to go before the launch of the PS5 Pro console, Sony is understandably ramping up the marketing. Their most recent video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnyzLf7cddE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows</a> Insomniac Games (in particular, the team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-purpose-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>) talking about what's most exciting about the new hardware. The highlighted feature is, once again, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marcus Smith (Creative Director):</strong> As a developer, Insomniac Games is always trying to do the biggest and the best and bring the deepest experiences to players. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson (Animation Lead):</strong> Knowing that gamers have to choose between the two modes of Performance or Fidelity is a little frustrating because we want our players to have the best experience possible.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson (Principal Engine Programmer):</strong> What excites me the most about the PS5 Pro is that you're basically getting both Performance and Fidelity in one package. There's no fear of missing out on something by choosing one or the other; it's really a game-changer. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Marcus Smit</em></strong><em><strong>h:</strong> Our players no longer have to choose and that means they're seeing the true vision of the game that we're trying to create. They're able to have a much more emotional experience as they explore our graphically intense worlds and at an extremely high fluid frame rate. </em><em>It really has opened up our ability to create worlds much truer to the vision that we had originally. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> PSSR is really exciting because it's this game-changer for bringing our visual fidelity up to the next level.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> There's so much that we put into this game, so many details and exciting little surprises. The player should be able to have the best experience while getting to see all of those things. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Jahrain Jackson:</strong> Being able to deliver all that we have to offer from that game is going to be phenomenal. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Lindsay Thompson:</strong> I think we have endless possibilities, and this new experience is going to be the best player experience possible.</em></p>
<p>Insomniac Games was not the first developer to single out PSSR as the main PS5 Pro advancement. We recently heard the same from <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-key-feature-could-be-pssr-says-dying-light-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techland</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-achieves-significant-performance-improvements-says-dev-the-most-impressive-aspect-is-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexon</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In other news, over the weekend, we got the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full specs leak</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-teardown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first teardown video</a> ahead of the official launch scheduled for this Thursday.</p>

            <p>When nightmarish sci-fi extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> launched into early access in September it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">somewhat messy</a>. Bugs and maddening enemy spawns diminished the tension of being a fleshy human scavenger in a mech battlefield. But one feature annoyed some players much more - fresh water. See, you need to keep your headquarters stocked with water, as it gets steadily used by your settlement's inhabitants. The catch being that this water diminishes even while you're not playing the game. If it runs out completely, then everything you've collected gets wiped. The developers have listened to complaints about this most Farmville of mechanics, and they've answered in an interesting way. Water thieves! Now, on top of the usual downward trickle, burglars will come to steal your H2O as well.</p>
<p>It's not as bad as it sounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Far from making things more difficult, the water thieves are really a way to give players who run out of water one last chance to scrape back from the loot wipe. They'll show up in your headquarters when you have basically no water left, and if you can manage to kill them and defend your home you'll get some water from their corpses and stave off the hideous thirstwipe for the time being. Fail to kill the home invaders and you'll suffer the usual consequences. </p>

<p>The water thieves are just one addition in the game's recent October update, which is mainly a bunch of bug fixes, a new map, and a frightening new mech boss called "the Rat King". You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4455841997094125639?snr=1_5_9_">the full patch notes here</a> but it basically seems to be the biggest update to the game so far, featuring more quests, a means of "AI buddy control" and some "AI pathing and combat improvements." Hopefully that means the enemies won't act quite as unpredictably as I've previously witnessed. </p><p>Meanwhile, the water system tweaks are not over, the developers say, as it's still a source of both confusion and annoyance for some folks. There are those who hate the way it gnaws at you even when you're not playing, and there are those who think it's not a big deal at all, insisting it's easy to find sufficient water in the battlefield to stay stocked up for a long time. I just feel it's the least of the game's design difficulties. Maybe picking up items should be less fiddly first? Maybe enemy sightlines should be more reliably knowable? Maybe tanks shouldn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U-ktTg7ACeI">fly into orbit</a>? There are a lot of things that make the moment-to-moment antics in these captivating death zones feel janky. Taken altogether, I'd say that's a bigger issue than one dwindling resource. </p>
<p>If you want to get a feel for the game without buying it, there's also now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/4542536020217823369?snr=1_5_9_">a demo</a>, in which you can only play alongside other demo users. It only has one map to enlootify - the Ashen Mesa. It's one of the better battle zones of the game from what I've played. But you can also see what the player headquarters looks like. All my quibbles with the game's rough state aside, it has some very good-looking environments. It's worth playing the demo just to indulge in a bit of mech war tourism. If you find any water, let me know. I won't steal it. Promise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
