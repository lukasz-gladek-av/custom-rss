            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-as-2024s-cod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This year’s COD has been confirmed to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as Activision follow up on a teaser site and leaked newspaper advertising with a formal announcement. The game will debut during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-and-a-redacted-direct-confirmed-for-june-9th/">Xbox Showcase on 9th June</a> with a Black Ops 6 Direct to follow immediately afterwards.</p>
<p><iframe title="wake up (rushmore) #thetruthlies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The advertising came with copies of USA Today in a promotional supplement that show’s the game’s logo, title and some in-universe news stories. In particular there’s the defacing of Mount Rushmore, which also appeared on <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 teaser website</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>That teaser site features an analogue TV which you can scroll through six channels, some of which give static, but the first of which shows Mount Rushmore’s defacement, and the sixth of which tunes in to News 6, with faux reporting of monuments around the world also being defaced.</p>
<p>Activision are building up to the full reveal of this year’s Call of Duty at the Xbox showcase at Summer Games Fest on 9th June. That showcase will be followed by a deep-dive into a game, secretively called ‘Redacted Direct’, but now rebranded as Black Ops 6 Direct.</p>

<p>2024 will be a huge year for Call of Duty. This will be the first game in the series released after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, and it will also come after a relative down year for the franchise, the back-to-back development of Modern Warfare III not exactly being a high-point. Returning to the popular Black Ops setting could be the boost that company execs want to see.</p>
<p>However, there’s also reports that Microsoft will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/report-call-of-duty-2024-will-come-to-xbox-game-pass-on-day-one/">throwing Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 straight into Xbox Game Pass</a>, potentially undermining the strong yearly sales of the game in an attempt to boost subscriber counts. This could also see Microsoft shake up the Game Pass price structure for the first time since Game Pass Ultimate was introduced.</p>

            <p>
More than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year across the video game industry.
</p>
<p>
That's according to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">archive tallying layoffs across the industry</a>, which has now hit an estimated total of 10,100 people.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning almost as many have been impacted so far in 2024 in less than half the time.

<p>

The archive lists layoffs by individual studio, publisher, or company, with Activision Blizzard having the most layoffs at 1900. This is followed by Unity with 1800, PlayStation Studios with 900, EA with 670, and Take Two with 600 (some of these numbers are approximate).
</p>
<p>
Some companies are listed but with an unknown number of people affected, while others are not yet included - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">Square Enix, for instance, has reportedly been impacted by an unknown number of layoffs</a> across its US and European offices.

</p>
<p>
Grouping together by parent company also reveals Microsoft has laid off at least 2150 people across its studios - the most of any company listed.
</p>
<p>
Coupled with 2023, over 20,000 people have lost their jobs in the video game industry in less than 18 months - an incredibly sobering statistic and indictment of the state of the industry.
</p>
<p>
Have layoffs reached an apex? It's impossible to say what the future holds, although you would expect the situation to settle for the foreseeable.
</p>
<p>
At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">Embracer</a> - one of the biggest contributors to layoffs from 2023-2024 - has now "successfully finalised" its restructuring programme. Its headcount has dropped by 4532 in the past 12 months.

</p>
<p>
"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.

</p>
<p>
"With so many people out of work, and so few jobs out there, you might expect to see new studios form. We will get a few, but with investors being increasingly conservative, the reality is that a lot of these artists, programmers, designers, producers, writers, and others will have to leave the games business to find work. I'm writing this article from a cold business point-of-view, but there's no denying the horrible human cost of this 'correction'. The anger towards executives, shareholders, and capitalism in general, is more than understandable."

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari-acquires-intellivision-burying-a-45-year-old-hatchet.879405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-intellivision-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has announced that it has acquired the Intellivision brand and game library, putting to rest a 45-year-old rivalry between the two classic gaming companies.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://atari.com/blogs/newsroom/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Atari website, the company says it's bought the brand and "certain games" from Intellivision Entertainment LLC, whose name might still be in your recent memory thanks to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaked-intellivision-amico-documents-paint-grim-picture">disastrous Amico debacle</a>.</p>

<p>That debacle may well be set to continue, though, because Atari says it hasn't acquired that aspect of the business. Instead, Intellivision Entertainment will apparently rebrand and continue distributing the Amico. Atari is also granting the company a license to distribute newer versions of Intellivision games on the Amico. Ow, my head.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-intellivision-purchase-amico.jpg?itok=zHF7ELYO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-intellivision-purchase-amico.jpg?itok=rP-RrC1X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This thing isn't included in Atari's purchase of Intellivision, and I'm sure Atari is relieved.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Atari, the legendary retro gaming company will "seek to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games", and new games under the brand name might also be on the cards.</p>

<p>Atari also says that the console war between itself and its (now-former) rival is "arguably...the first console war of consequence" and "the longest-running console war in history", although I'm not sure either participant was particularly interested in fighting towards the end.</p>

<p>More than 200 Intellivision properties, along with the Intellivision trademark itself, are included in this purchase, but Atari doesn't specify what those 200 properties actually are.</p>

<p>Still, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-problems-cause-significant-staff-layoffs">disastrous</a> history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intellivision-amico-future-in-doubt-as-creators-admit-massive-debt">the Amico</a> and the reputation of its "visionary" Tommy Tallarico, it's arguable Atari has bought the best parts of Intellivision and left the most toxic ones behind.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atari-50-intellivision.jpg?itok=XaXrFoqW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atari-50-intellivision.jpg?itok=Rzow9f16 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could an Intellivision retrospective collection akin to <em>Atari 50&nbsp;</em>be on the cards?</figcaption></figure><p>Atari CEO Wade Rosen, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-ceo-offers-to-buy-atari-after-rough-year">purchased the company back in late 2022</a>, describes the Intellivision purchase as "a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors" and bring together retro gaming fans of all stripes.</p>

<p>Intellivision Entertainment head Phil Adam, meanwhile, says he's confident Atari will be a "responsible steward of the storied Intellivision brand".</p>

<p>It's not yet clear what kind of games or projects this purchase will yield, but expect Atari to dig deep into the Intellivision vaults to see what it can salvage. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Embracer Group said that the Alone in the Dark reboot failed to meet expectations after its March 2024 release. The announcement came as part of <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Embracer-Group-publishes-Interim-Report-Q4-January-March-2024-Adjusted-EBIT-increased-by-56-to-SEK-1426-million-240523.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s latest earnings report</a> released on Thursday.</p>



<p>The company says that the reboot of the 1990s classic franchise had a “softer-than-expected performance”. They added that despite seeing a “positive reception from users”, the game, along with Outcast: A New Beginning, had a “mixed reception from critics and ultimately performed below management expectations.”</p>



<p>This performance that Embracer viewed as negative could be viewed as what led to developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-lays-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pieces Interactive having layoffs</a> just a month after its launch. As of writing, Embracer Group had yet to publicly comment on the layoffs. However, the studio did announce around the same time as the layoffs that it was set to split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three different companies</a>.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of the game</a>, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that he didn’t feel like he could “reliably advocate for buying Alone in the Dark at full price.”</p>



<p>He added: “It’s not&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong>, but there’s just something lacking that doesn’t allow the player to experience satisfaction at any point throughout the story.”</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/upcoming-patch-content.1681104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on the Paradox forum, an upcoming update for Cities Skylines 2 will rework the economy system. </p>



<p>The update will improve management, challenges, and clarification for the consequences of player actions. The developers clarify that the update is still “currently being polished,” and it “will not address everything.” </p>



<p>At this time, the team is aiming to release the patch somewhere between June 3 and 19, 2024. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to the Cities Skylines 2 economy, Paradox’s new forum post also gives fans an update on the console builds. The devs state that they “still hope we can keep the timeline for an October release.” </p>



<p>However, they also warned fans that “it might have to be delayed further.” This follows the results of various stability tests on a Beta build delivery last April. </p>



<p>Cities Skylines 2 has faced a variety of issues, including the launch of its recent DLC. Paradox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-apologizes-again-after-even-more-cities-skylines-2-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even apologized</a> over the state of the game last April. </p>



<p>So, it may be particularly wise for the team to spend enough time to roll out smooth console builds. Fortunately, the devs did work to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-is-finally-getting-mod-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduce mod support</a> in March, a highly requested feature from longtime fans.</p>



<p>Paradox just recently slowed down Life By You, retracting its Early Access release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-pulls-life-by-you-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this week</a>. Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja simply explained that “additional development time is needed” for Life By You.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-review-in-progress.879393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Almost two years after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-review-open-beta"><u>my open beta review</u></a> and about a year since it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-fans-react-to-game-shutting-down-until-2024"><u>put on hiatus</u></a> and taken offline, MultiVersus is finally coming back. Last week, I was given early access to this new and improved version for a handful of days, which included cool new fighters, interesting new stages, and even a brand-new single-player mode. Those additions are mostly great, but some changes to the pace of matches and some prevalent network troubles did make my return to Warner Bros. Games’ free-to-play fighter a little bittersweet. My minimal time with it means I’ll need to play lots more after its full release next week before I can make a final judgment, but so far MultiVersus is still a fun time with deep combat for those who want to work through its many progression systems.</p><p>Let’s start with what hasn’t changed: MultiVersus remains a platform fighter with a general focus on 2v2 team battles, filling out its roster with characters from the Warner Bros. portfolio, be that Bugs Bunny or Batman. True to the genre, dealing damage to your opponents increases the knockback they’ll suffer from big hits, and you score kills by knocking a character off the edge of the stage rather than reducing a health bar to zero. That familiar base was very well executed in MultiVersus’ first outing, and it’s still just as much fun here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>MultiVersus Characters</h3></div></output><p>Each character takes on the role of either Bruiser, Mage, Assassin, Tank, or Support, which acts as a suitable guideline when choosing your fighter. Bruisers like Scooby Doo’s best friend Shaggy are typically more straightforward to play as, while Mages such as The Joker or Assassins like Stripe from Gremlins tend to have more tricks up their sleeve. Team-centric moves are still a cool wrinkle to consider as well, like Wonder Woman’s partner shield buff or Bugs Bunny’s ability to dig a quick-traveling tunnel. However, I couldn't immediately determine the cooperative capabilities of new characters like Banana Guard, a newbie-friendly spear-wielder, or Jason Voorhees, a teleporting and grappling terror – granted, a majority of my online matches so far have been 1v1. When MultiVersus goes live properly, I’ll be interested to see whether team battles are actually still its priority, or if they’re just a cute remnant of the past.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The roster has gotten a visual overhaul that looks great.</p></div><p>For its re-debut, developer Player First Games has given the MultiVersus roster a visual overhaul, providing each character with extra detail to their models and animations that look great. Characters are now physically larger, too, and combat has been slowed down overall compared to the blistering pace of the beta. Getting across the map takes noticeably longer, attacks are slower to execute, and jumps feel floatier. It’s all to make the action more readable, and while I was a fan of the previous speed of MultiVersus, it’s a change I appreciate for some fighters. Speedy Assassin characters like Arya Stark have been toned down a smidge but can still appropriately run circles around the rest of the cast, while burly Tanks such as Iron Giant are expected to be lumbering and slow, so the change isn’t even quite as noticeable. However, my issue with this new battle tempo lies with the average-sized bruisers like Shaggy, who had me checking my network connection for abnormalities because it felt like I was struggling to move through a vat of molasses. I didn’t get a chance to play as the entire cast yet, so maybe it’s not a blanket problem for the mid-size brawlers, but I’ll be keeping a keen eye on it going forward.</p><p>One of my concerns with MultiVersus during its beta period was a severe lack of activities outside of its bare-bones online matches – the focus was solely on competition rather than goofy fights with wacky conditions that are present in other games in the genre. Luckily, a new PvE mode called Rifts is a step in the right direction, even if my initial impression wasn’t entirely glowing. Rifts let you take on a series of fights and other challenges that often add fun Mutators to the match. One granted infinite jumps, letting me soar through the stage unfettered, while others will have you avoiding explosives raining from the sky. Rifts also throw you into other activities like makeshift shooting galleries and target-breaking challenges. These new mission types aren’t always enjoyable and feel chintzy at times, but they manage to break up the monotony of regular battles enough that I’m looking forward to seeing more in the future. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The long-term fun of Rifts will rely on the potential of its wild scenarios.</p></div><p>Taking down each event in a Rift rewards you with random cosmetics and a new type of item called Gems. Not to be confused with the character perks you earn and equip in online PvP matches, Gems are exclusive to Rifts and, when equipped, provide balance-breaking abilities that would only fly in this PvE mode. Some early Gems I encountered granted a chance to auto-dodge attacks while giving a significant boost to defense, made my character electrified when a condition is met paired with increased attack power, or allowed a character to have a third jump for extra mobility. My hope is these enhancements will have increasingly cool effects that aim to break the game in more fun and playstyle-changing ways. I enjoyed what I’ve seen of Rifts so far, but its long-term fun will rely on the potential of the wild scenarios Mutators create and how you’re able to mitigate their challenge with Gems.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While the early look I got of MultiVersus wasn’t entirely the full experience we’ll get at launch, some concerns did arise during my time with it. For much of one day, the servers were in duress, causing outages in gameplay, lag in games, and errors when attempting to find matches online. What’s worse, I was struggling to get into Rifts, which, while playable solo, very much relies on a network connection. Will MultiVersus be completely unplayable if your network drops out or WB Games’ servers are down? That seems like the case, and that’s an awful feeling when trying to practice or grind through a PvE mode. </p><p>That said, my connection in many matches felt great outside of that handful of network hiccups, almost as if I were playing in the same room as my opponent. Of course, I still need to play a lot more and on live servers to determine whether the online netcode will ultimately hold up in this newest iteration. </p><p>There’s still a ton for me to check out when MultiVersus launches next week. What does the grind for purchasing new characters look like? How much is there to do on a given day to complete the various battle passes, events, and character-specific progression paths? What does the free-to-play economy look like two years later? As a fan of the beta, this brief window has left me optimistic, so I’m stoked to check out more of MultiVersus when it's freed from the Warner Bros. Water Tower for good – and I’ll have a final scored review shortly after I do.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog's next game "could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming" according to studio head Neil Druckmann.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a> with Naughty Dog and PlayStation owner Sony, Druckmann was asked to share his personal vision or dream project that he hopes to see realised in the future. Having held co-directing and lead writing roles for both The Last of Us and Uncharted franchises, Druckmann said he's worked on several dream projects already but is still looking forward to the next one.</p><p>"[I] am currently excited about a new one, which is perhaps the most thrilling yet," Druckmann said. Nothing is known about Naughty Dog's next game externally but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dog-has-chosen-its-next-game-but-doesnt-confirm-the-last-of-us-part-3">the studio confirmed in March 2023 it had decided on a project</a>.</p><p>Druckmann offered a brief tease of what that game looks to achieve. "There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up," he began. "This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers.</p><p>"The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p><p>This is all very conceptual, of course, but it sounds as though Naughty Dog plans to make a bigger leap than ever before with its next game. Outside of remasters, remakes, and collections, it last released The Last of Us: Part 2 in 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review">Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</a> in 2017, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</a> in 2016.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-review">Our review of its latest returned a 10/10</a>. "The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way," we said.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Activision has officially announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 through a teaser video. It's rumored to release this October across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Microsoft now owns Activision and the Call of Duty franchise, but new releases--like Black Ops 6--will continue to launch as multiplatform releases.</p><p>Basically nothing is known about Black Ops 6 as of yet, but the teaser video describes it as a "dark new chapter" of the Black Ops series. The game's worldwide reveal will take place on June 9 as part of the Xbox Games Showcase event. </p><p dir="ltr">The story for Black Ops 6 is rumored to take place, at least in part, during the Gulf War. Call of Duty games are known to be globetrotting affairs that travel through numerous locations--and time periods. So if the Gulf War is part of the game's story, it could be just one element of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors have suggested the new game has been in the works for a long time and will be the first game in franchise history to have been <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1782123698893279545">developed over a four-year period</a>. This lies in stark contrast to 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/">reportedly made in just 18 months.</a></p><p dir="ltr">This is the sixth entry in the series since it debuted in 2010. The Black Ops franchise within Call of Duty has become one of the most popular of all, and lucrative, too. Dave Anthony, the director of the first two Black Ops games, recently discussed how he made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-boss-lists-bel-air-mansion-for-astronomical-price-see-inside/1100-6523192/">"incredible amounts of money"</a> during his career.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4307233-screenshot2024-05-23at9.54.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4307233" data-ratio="0.55871559633028" data-width="2180" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4307233-screenshot2024-05-23at9.54.07am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4307233"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 is on the way</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4307233-screenshot2024-05-23at9.54.07am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In terms of returning characters, it's rumored that Adler is coming back, but that's all we know so far. The Black Ops series is known for featuring real-life people, like Ronald Reagan (Black Ops Cold War) and Robert McNamara (Black Ops 1), so it wouldn't be surprising to see real-life military and political leaders from the Gulf War era appear in the new game.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-gulf-war-campaign-open-world/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> said Raven Software is developing the game's campaign, with Treyarch--the creator of the Black Ops series--handling multiplayer and Zombies. Treyarch and Raven seemingly confirmed their involvement in the game in social media posts. Activision is known to recruit teams from across its entire network of Call of Duty studios to contribute to each year's new release in some fashion, and that formula is expected to continue this year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about the next Call of Duty. </a>Black Ops 6 will join Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, and Call of Duty: Mobile on the market at the same time.</p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-sunken-treasures-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunken Treasures dig event</a> is live from May 23 to May 26, with 16 reward tiers to claim. Finishing every level requires obtaining pickaxes and digging through the event’s treasure grid. Here’s every way you can get more pickaxes during the Sunken Treasures event.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-sunken-treasures-pickaxes-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">How to get more Sunken Treasures pickaxes in Monopoly GO</h2> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">Below are the three main ways to get more pickaxes during <em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Sunken Treasures dig event:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false"> <li>Participate in banner events and tournaments</li> <li>Complete daily quick wins</li> <li>Redeem free shop gifts</li> </ul> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true">Events and tournaments are your bread and butter during the dig event, as they can give you hundreds of pickaxes. Daily wins usually provide around 12 pickaxes daily, while shop gifts give three per box. In other words, while daily wins and store gifts can reward you with the few extra pickaxes you may need for the next level, you’ll need to finish several tiers of ongoing tournaments to finish the entire dig event.</p>
 <h3 id="h-banner-events-and-tournaments" data-injectable="false">Banner events and tournaments</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true">Your main method of obtaining more pickaxes is participating in events such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-all-map-of-fortunes-rewards-and-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Map of Fortunes</a>. Banner events give well over 100 pickaxes during their duration, making it a fantastic opportunity to get some pickaxes and fly through Sunken Treasures’ levels. </p>
 <h3 id="h-daily-quick-wins" data-injectable="false">Daily Quick Wins</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">Another method to obtaining free pickaxes during <em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Sunken Treasures event is to complete your three daily quick-win objectives. You can get 12 pickaxes by finishing them, allowing you to get 36 extra pickaxes during Sunken Treasures’ three-day duration.</p>
 <h3 id="h-free-store-gifts" data-injectable="false">Free store gifts</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">The last way to get Sunken Treasures pickaxes is to redeem free store gifts every eight hours. Each gift gives around three pickaxes, allowing you to get around a dozen during the event’s duration. Although you’ll need more to get through later levels, it can make a massive difference between finishing the event or being a few pickaxes away, especially if you miss a few banner event tiers.</p>
 <h2 id="h-are-there-any-free-pickaxe-links-in-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">Are there any free pickaxe links in&nbsp;<em>Monopoly GO</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Scopely typically doesn’t release free pickaxe links during dig events, including the Sunken Treasures event. Although free dice links are common, with the occasional sticker pack or Partners event token mixed in, they typically don’t include pickaxes. You’ll have to rely on the above methods to get more pickaxes.</p> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="false">However, Scopely does surprise us often, so some could appear over the next three days. We’ll update this page with the latest pickaxe links if they appear, so stay tuned for more details.</p>

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Atari announced today that they have acquired the brand of one of their formal rivals, Intellivision, as well as certain games. I know what you’re thinking, but the beleaguered Amico wasn’t part of the deal. That legacy lives on.</p> <p data-characters="616" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">Let grandma tell you a story (this is actually before my time, as well, whippersnapper.) While it’s generally remembered that the Atari 2600 dominated the early days of consoles, it wasn’t the only one on the market (or the first). During its heyday, it went up against a few competing consoles like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/looking-back-on-fairchild-channel-f-45th-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairchild Channel F</a> and Magnavox Odyssey 2. But none came closer to threatening its dominance like Mattel’s Intellivision. Things were looking good for Mattel Electronics when the bottom fell out of the video game market in the Crash of 1983. Things were so dire that Mattel sold the Intellivision brand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Then, in 2018, the rights were picked up by Tommy Tallarico to create the new console, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/intellivisions-new-console-will-release-next-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Intellivision Amico</a>. It was a catastrophe and it isn’t even technically out yet. You can still pre-order it if you, for some reason, want to. Maybe the money from the Atari deal will finally be what gets it out the door.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">The Amico will remain with its parent company (currently Intellivision Entertainment), but both company and hardware will be renamed to remove the Intellivision branding. It will also include “a license from Atari to continue to distribute new versions of the Intellivision games on the Amico console.”</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">Atari will get the rights to use the Intellivision name, as well as over 200 titles that belonged to the company.</p> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">This is an interesting but somewhat unsurprising move by Atari. The company is pushing with a retro-first strategy, releasing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-atari-2600-plus-retro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new versions</a> of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-the400-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classic hardware</a> and bringing in remaster studios <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/atari-enters-agreement-to-purchase-nightdive-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Nightdive</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/atari-is-set-to-acquire-legendary-game-preservationists-digital-eclipse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Eclipse</a>. They’ve been using the licenses in their portfolio to create new low-budget titles like Sneakybox’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-berzerk-recharged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Recharged</em> series</a>. Buying the Intellivision rights gives them more options for both hardware and software.</p>
 <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="127" data-injectable="false">Atari has also <a href="https://atari.com/products/intellivision-tee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released T-shirts</a> to celebrate the occasion, because merchandising is another piece of the company’s strategy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-creator-packs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox and Colossal Order have revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>economy rework patch is almost ready, but as a result, the game's upcoming Creator Packs have been delayed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/upcoming-patch-and-content" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on its official website</a>, Paradox says that the economy patch is currently set for release somewhere between June 3rd and June 19th. The patch "will not address everything", but internal and beta testing suggests the studios are "heading in the right direction".</p>

<p>Sadly, it's going to be a little longer before you can get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>'s Creator Packs. That's down to the extra feedback and adjustment the patch will need, as well as Sweden and Finland's "summer lock" system, which gives employees the right to four consecutive vacation weeks in summer.</p>

<p>As regards the&nbsp;game's console release, which has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay">delayed</a> more <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">than once</a> since its initial announcement, Paradox says internal testing has shown the studio is "not hitting the stability and performance targets" it wants to hit for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>As a result, Paradox says it's hoping to keep to the October release window for the console versions, but that they "might have to be delayed further" to allow for more technical tweaking.</p>

<p>Released in October last year,&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>suffered from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-gets-first-of-several-patches-to-improve-performance-following-flawed">technical issues on release</a>, leading Paradox and Colossal Order to promise that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-paid-dlc-performance">no paid DLC would be released for the game</a> until those issues were fixed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, players didn't feel the studios had kept that promise when the "Beach Properties" DLC pack launched earlier this year, and the resulting outcry led Paradox to pull the pack from sale and incorporate its content into the base game instead.</p>

<p>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>are still coming; back in April, the game received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-update-dlss-super-resolution">DLSS support and a ton of bug fixes</a>, and the next patch is set to introduce a major rework for the game's economic systems.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>. It's also available via PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anthology-of-the-killer">Anthology of the Killer</a> you do not exit the game using a pause menu. You exit it by walking down a back alley into the quavering arms of two hungry bears. This is just one of many laughs your diaphragm will endure as you navigate "the escalating adventures of a girl trying to make zines in a town of giallo-style masked serial murderers". The horror comedy already won its creators the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/venba-wins-igf-grand-prize-for-2024">Nuovo Award at the Independent Games Festival</a> this year, recognition that has been a long time coming for prolific creator Stephen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/thecatamites">"thecatamites"</a> Gillmurphy. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you can get acquainted next week, when Anthology of the Killer gets its <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer/devlog/735392/releases-28th-may">full release on Itch.io</a> on May 28th.  At which point you can explore its unsettling urban hell of shady corporations and cops who think they're cool. There's a trailer below.</p>

<p>In the first of the nine-part series, protagonist BB is an employee of a life insurance call centre were everyone wears sheets over their head. When you sit at BB's desk to work, the usual office chatter slows to a haunting warble, like listening to a cassette tape submerged in a bathtub of jam. A TV in the break room is set to a news channel reporting that 1000 bodies have been found somewhere ("Same news as always," remarks BB.) In the printer room a sign yells: "Remember! We don't pay out if the corpse is unidentifiable!" When you walk into the complaints department, the doors lock behind you. What follows is... well, I'll let you figure it out.</p>
<p>Many point to the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> as examples of excellent writing in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure games</a>.  I will point to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/thecatamites">the entire body of work by thecatamites</a>.  As ever, it's the combination of DIY MS Paint visuals and a surreal comic voice that draws me in. The sea's breathy waves are caused by geology, "the baleful science". When our zine-printing heroine is nabbed by the cops she reflects that "Rule #1 of making a zine is never talk to the police." She lives in an apartment block with metal shutters that clamp closed at night which is "far beneath today's superior anti-murderer technology". I could basically pick any dialogue box that appears in any of these games and it would have something worth smiling at, or frowning at, or feeling <em>something</em> at.</p>

<p>Thecatamites has been making short games for over a decade now. At this stage I have lost count. Many of us at RPS have been fans of his work. After a period of tinkering away he tends to compile a bunch of his games together, as with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/10-beautiful-postcards-is-some-new-craic-from-thecatamites">10 Beautiful Postcards</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thecatamites-commercial-collection-50-short-games">50 Short Games</a>. In the same vein (blood joke) Anthology of the Killer compiles a bunch of games he's made in the last few years. This time it's a clear serial format though, the story continuing its bloody theme with each new installment: Hands of the Killer, Face of the Killer, Drool of the Killer. You might have already been playing through BB's story as each episode was released, but if not, this collection handily puts them all in one place, all complimented by <a href="http://harmonyzone.org/press/html/ad/face.jpg">poster art by A. Degen</a>. </p>
<p>In today's tempest of game releases, small games sometimes slip past our ever-watchful eyes. So it's a good thing Gillmurphy got in touch with RPS to let us know the murder mystery compilation was due out soon. </p>
<p>"I believe the concept of 'death' will be a big hit with the readership," he said, "as why else would they be playing video games."</p>
<p>A valid observation. I am interested in this innovative approach. </p>

</figure>
<p>Gillmurphy calls the murderthon a "comparatively straight narrative", somewhat underselling his skill as one of the homegrown scene's most creative storytellers. Playing through thecatamites work after a long time of consuming clinically polished "story rich" blockbusters is like having the language centers of your brain treated with a batch of medicinal maggots. It looks horrible! But once the maggots roll away, holy shit, what a sparkling temporal lobe you've got. It is writing as a controlled explosion, but the detonator is one of those fake Pringles cans with a spring snake inside. Text as the rediscovery of a forgotten species that doesn't quite match the other amphibians, but yes, is (probably?) still a frog. It's worth reading his musings on <a href="https://myfriendpokey.tumblr.com/post/705461201521573889/personal-aesthetics">art as a lucky bag</a>, if nothing else.  </p>

<p>One might say I am exaggerating, or that thecatamites' writing is an acquired taste, but you may easily acquire it in any of the following methods: </p>
<ul>
<li>suffering the Irish psyche</li>
<li>subsisting for years on an auditory diet of avant-garde music</li>
<li>playing his games</li>
</ul>
<p>That last method is easy. You can start next week with <a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer">Anthology of the Killer</a>. Or else...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Concord, the upcoming sci-fi&nbsp;PVP multiplayer FPS from PlayStation's Firewalk Studios, is expected to receive a gameplay reveal soon.</p>
<p>At least, that's what reputable deals leaker 'Billbil-kun' has said. In a <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-nouveau-a-propos-de-concord-la-prochaine-exclusivite-de-playstation-51320" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new article</a> on French deals website Dealabs, the leaker writes that a second announcement for the game is expected to be made within 15 days from now. Although the exact date isn't sure, the leaker writes that new details will be shared during either the rumored PlayStation showcase or the Summer Game Fest 2024 on June 7. "This announcement is expected to feature at least some of the playable characters&nbsp;in the game with a preview of&nbsp;the gameplay", 'Billbil-kun' writes on Dealabs. "Let's also remember that we had stated that the game was inspired by the universe of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, following the first elements we had in our possession."</p>
<p>Concord from Firewalk was first announced back in May of last year. Interestingly enough, 'Billbil-kun' already suggested <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-january-31st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that Sony would be showing off the game during the State of Play broadcast back in January of this year</a>. "The ad was even ready to be presented during State of Play which took place last January", the leaker writes. "However, this announcement did not take place&nbsp;for reasons that we do not yet know although&nbsp;we believe it was because of some problems encountered on the PC version."</p>
<p>Sony has yet to confirm a new PlayStation showcase, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-is-planned-for-this-month-jeff-grubb-reiterates-could-happen-at-any-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent rumors suggest that the event will take place later this month</a>. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about either Concord or the rumored PlayStation event.</p>
<p>Concord has yet to receive an official release date, but according to Firewalk Studios, the game is coming to both PS5 and PC later this year. We've included the teaser trailer for Concord, as revealed last year, below:</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24162612/multiversus-pve-rifts-batman-kevin-conroy-death</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus%E2%80%99-batman-is-still-kevin-conroy-%E2%80%98for-the-foreseeable-future%E2%80%99.879348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162612/multiversus-pve-rifts-batman-kevin-conroy-death<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fMligV">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/9/13/23345074/multiversus-opinion-dodge-cooldown-meter-ui-player-first-games"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> developer Player First Games announced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158526/multiversus-pve-mode-rifts-video">a new PvE mode</a> for its fighting game. That mode, called Rifts, will feature unique battle scenarios and minigames, as well as cinematics and story elements, the developer says. It will be updated seasonally with new content.</p>
<p id="YaO4bB">We’ll see characters interact in mode-specific ways in Rifts, and Player First promises to keep adding to the PvE mode season to season. With a fully voiced cast featuring the talents of John Dimaggio, Matthew Lillard, Tara Strong, and others, the game will bring a long list of beloved characters together for some first-of-their-kind interactions.</p>
<p id="nyjsXO">One notable issue the developers face is the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23453290/batman-kevin-conroy-actor-obituary">death of Kevin Conroy</a>, the iconic voice of Batman and Bruce Wayne in animated features and video games. In <em>MultiVersus</em>, Conroy is reunited with fellow <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> actor <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">Mark Hamill, the famous voice of the Joker</a>. In an interview with Player First Games co-founder and <em>MultiVersus</em> game director Tony Huynh, I asked him how the studio plans to approach future content featuring Batman in the wake of Conroy’s passing.</p>
<p id="V5CvNy">“Kevin Conroy was a big part of my childhood,” Huynh told me before addressing the issue, “and Batman is my favorite fictional character, period. Kevin’s passing really affected me personally. And I think that the pairing of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy in our game is special.</p>
<p id="hBdNgI">“I actually don’t know what we’re gonna do going forward. We have to figure that out. No matter what though, we want to be respectful of Kevin and the legacy that he left behind. A big reason why, I think, Mark Hamill is in the game is because Kevin is as well. So Kevin is extremely important to our game, and the work that he’s done for our game will persist. Going forward, I don’t know fully what we’re going to be doing. We do plan on updating the game regularly and have to come up with plan for that, but that isn’t finalized yet.”</p>
<p id="1rd69b">A representative for Warner Bros. Games added that “there was a lot of voiceover work that was done” by Conroy, “so, for the foreseeable future, that’s who Batman will be in <em>MultiVersus</em>.”</p>
<p id="PCBaaa"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros"><em>MultiVersus</em> will return, with many new additions, on May 28</a>. The free-to-play game will be available once again on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.</p>

The Ultra Space Wonders event is now underway, introducing the Fireworks Pokemon Blacephalon and two other Ultra Beasts to the game.

                <p dir="ltr">Player First Games and Warner Bros. made a risky decision last year by deciding to put its platform fighter MultiVersus on hiatus and pull it from digital stores--especially when some players had spent real-world money on characters and cosmetics. With MultiVersus set to return next week, Player First has revealed what returning players can expect to see when they log in to the game for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with GameSpot during a recent preview session, Huynh confirmed that "all characters and cosmetics players purchased before May 28 will still be there when [players] come back to the game." That's not all, however, as Huynh also confirmed some new content will be offered free of charge to those who choose to return.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Also, any players who return within the first two weeks of the game's relaunch--from May 28 to June 11--will also receive the first battle pass and its 70 levels of cosmetics, currency, and characters for no additional charge. That includes an instant unlock of the pass's level one perk: Jason Voorhees as a playable character.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, if they unlocked the entire roster during the open beta period, any returning players who log into the game before June 11 will only have to unlock one character, Joker, once they're in the game. All previously unlocked characters, as well as two brand-new characters, will be available on day one. "We understand how players would feel," Huynh said when asked about this "welcome back" package, "and we're trying to make good on that."</p><p dir="ltr">During our preview session, we got to try out Joker, Jason, and Banana Guard, as well as run through a few challenges in Rifts, MultiVersus's new PvE mode. We also spoke to Huynh about the risks in going on a long hiatus, how development has changed in the year since the game was removed, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">MultiVersus returns to digital storefronts May 28 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

        <p>"We all agreed that our hearts could not let Mohammed Fahmi's vision go to waste"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The difficulties of game development means it's not uncommon for the original creator to depart from the project before it's finished, for one reason or another. It's not often as tragic as is the case of Afterlove EP.</p>
<p>The music-centric narrative game was first announced in December 2021 on Nintendo's Indie World showcase. Just a few months later, the game's creative director <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/coffee-talk-creator-fahmi-dies-at-32">Mohammed Fahmi passed away</a>.</p>
<p>His sudden passing felt like a huge loss, especially as his breakout game Coffee Talk had made him a beacon for Indonesia's growing indie scene, while Pikselnesia, the studio he assembled for Afterlove EP, was also a remote team with people from across the country. It could have then been all too easy for it to all collapse afterwards but if anything, it was a catalyst for the surviving members to finish what Fahmi had started.</p>
<p>"We stopped work to grieve for three months and then we all agreed that our hearts could not let his vision go to waste and we had to finish the game, no matter what," says game director and programmer Dany.</p>
<p>After going under relative radio silence, Afterlove EP recently re-emerged at this year's LudoNarraCon with a free Steam demo, and a release window for Q3 2024. It would have nonetheless felt very raw given that the game's premise is also about grief and trying to move on after a loved one's untimely passing.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In everything we've done [on Afterlove EP], we hold Fahmi close to our hearts and think about what he would say if he was here"</p>
<cite>Dany, Pikselnesia</cite></blockquote>
<p>The cause of Fahmi's death had never been publicly confirmed, although Coffee Talk publisher Toge Productions had said he had been suffering from asthma. When Afterlove EP starts and players get a glimpse of protagonist's Rama relationship with Cinta, who also has signs of respiratory problems, followed by urgent messages on his phone that he receives too late, it's hard not to draw eerie parallels with what the team would have personally experienced.</p>
<p>"With Fahmi's passing, we were all experiencing the feeling that Rama feels and we understand what he is going through very intimately," says Dany. "It's hard to point to any specific elements where it has changed but in everything we've done, we hold Fahmi close to our hearts and think about what he would say if he was here."</p>
<p>But even with Fahmi's passing early in Afterlove EP's development, it wasn't as if the team was at a complete loss.</p>
<p>"One thing I like from working with Fahmi is that he doesn't leave anything in a grey area – either it's black or white," game producer Ivor Dwitomo explains. "He knew what he wanted for sure. The story outline was well documented before he passed away and the big direction decisions for Afterlove EP from start to end were very clear."</p>
<p>There was still a big task for that narrative to be broken down into scenes and dialogue, with writing totally over 100,000 words. "There are always changes as you go from planning to actually writing, and seeing it in the game then rewriting and so on, so we could not keep everything set in stone," Dwitomo adds.</p>

</figure>
<p>Fortunately, Fahmi was not Afterlove EP's only writer at the time, having also worked closely with Sasha Ariana, who was also a writer on his previous game What Comes After as well as A Space for the Unbound. She naturally stepped in to be the game's narrative lead.</p>
<p>"She is the keeper of the vision for the story and has helped guide the new writers to ensure we maintain Fahmi's vision for the story," Dwitomo says. "Whilst being open to feedback and making changes to some of the details to help the game achieve that vision and be as good as possible."</p>
<p>Another team member that really aided in pooling the team's knowledge from working with Fahmi was lead programmer Giri Prahasta Iruma. "He's like a human database," says Dany. "If we have questions about direction on something he can always find links to old chats with Fahmi discussing it, and Fahmi's answers even then were so clear – the why, the direction, the target experience. So it's been both Fahmi's outlines and vision and Giri's knowledge to help us never get off track."</p>
<p>Pikselnesia's personal experiences won't mean there is an authored version of how Rama processes his grief. This is still a choice-based narrative game where there will be different outcomes on how he will move on or not, whether he can find new love, or keep his band together. Those choices in what you can do are also under the constraint of a Persona-inspired calendar structure as the story takes place over a 30-day period.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We don't know what will happen in the future but I have the feeling the team will meet again to make something"</p>
<cite>Ivor Dwitomo, Pikselnesia</cite></blockquote>
<p>More importantly, Afterlove EP's not about wallowing in grief. There's even a light touch to it given that Rama's basically hearing and talking to the cheery voice of his deceased girlfriend inside his head, leading to some awkward but humorous moments with his friends.</p>
<p>"Sadness and grief will not dominate in the story – all emotional aspects will be there," says Dwitomo. "This is more about Rama's future than his past. The game starts one year after Cinta's passing and Rama is just starting to come out of his shell and become open to the world again. He wants to move forward but he's nervous and scared and not sure how to – does he want to try to make music seriously? What sort of relationships and friendships does he want to have? Can he love again? How can he honour Cinta's memory and do these things at the same time?"</p>
<p>One of Fahmi's key goals was for Afterlove EP to also help put Indonesia's capital of Jakarta, the setting of the game, on the map. That's still very much the case where players will primarily be exploring areas in the city's W Bloc, based on Jakarta's real life M Bloc as both a thriving space for shopping and nightlife.</p>
<p>Also giving an authentic flavour of the local culture, the game also includes songs from Jakarta-based band L'alphalpha, who are also a key plot point in the story. We're told that four of the tracks contributed had also been recorded after Fahmi's passing, with one song dedicated to him specifically.</p>
<p>"That song is called Mimpi, and the lyrics are very much dedicated to Fahmi. The lyrics hit us very hard," Dany adds.</p>
<p>But if finishing Afterlove EP is fulfilling Fahmi's last wish, then what comes after? While Pikselnesia was his studio and legacy, it's most likely that the team will disband once the game is complete.</p>
<p>"Before Fahmi passed away, I had a discussion with him about the next project for Pikselnesia," Dwitomo explains, though those ideas were never shared. Hopefully its members will be able to move on once the game is released and in turn have new stories to tell.</p>
<p>"We don't know what will happen in the future but I have the feeling the team will meet again to make something."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It was an odd and almost unheard of situation when Warner Bros. Games closed off free-to-play platform fighter MultiVersus last year. What was a seemingly live and active online fighting game with two seasons of content released was taken away from players less than a year after its initial release. Sure, it was technically branded as an “open beta” thoughout, but it was baffling to see it go offline with a promised relaunch for 2024. Why shut the game down for that long?&nbsp;It didn’t seem to be in crisis, since there was an active playerbase and even plans for community tournaments. Fans of the mashup brawler weren’t sure what big revamps or additions necessitated the year of complete lack of access to the game. After spending some time with the new version of MultiVersus that’s set to launch on 28th May, I’m still not sure I understand the logic behind this.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Launch Trailer &quot;Stars Collide. Pies Fly.&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qX5AUVIAg_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re a returning player from the initial version of the game, everything that was there is back – all 23 playable characters, every stage, and even any cosmetics or items you unlocked and purchased. Of course there’s also new additions, with a Mark Hamill voiced Joker, Agent Smith from The Matrix, a hockey masked Jason, and more naturally on the way.</p>


<p>Back when MultiVersus was first online, it featured a loaded cash shop, and multiple premium battle passes stuffed with cosmetics and currency, and none of this has changed in the new version of MultiVersus – well, <a href="http://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">they’ve rejigged the currency names and what they do a bit</a>. If you’re a fan of collecting daily rewards, multiple currencies, and hundreds of tiered Battle Pass unlocks, the system at play here won’t bother you one bit. If you’re someone who’s a little exhausted by every game being turned into a job, though, it feels weird to boot up this big new relaunch of MultiVersus after a year and be greeted by the same slightly overwhelming seasonal objectives and mission lists that were there last time.</p>


<p>Some aspects of the experience are harder for me to directly compare to the open beta version of MultiVersus – a year out from the shut down of that version, and I don’t really remember the nuances of how combat felt or how the netcode performed, nor do I have any way to quickly revisit that version of the game for reference. Here’s what I came away from this new version of MultiVersus with, though: this game is now slow.</p>
<p>Combat, according to developer blog posts, has been reworked significantly to take the focus away from a constant flow of attack inputs and make everything much more deliberate, readable and possible to react to. The result is a platform fighter with next to no momentum. Every attack animation has a slow, winding start that completely cancels out the visual momentum of the move that came before it. Instead of stringing together a combo of basic and special attacks as Wonder Woman, I’m waiting and watching her perform a neutral attack, then waiting and watching her perform a neutral side attack, and then waiting some more as she busts out the Up Special I feel like I input hours ago.</p>

<p>This shift in speed and stilted animation momentum don’t necessarily make the game easier, but rather a lot less exciting. On harder difficulties and in full 2v2 matches against AI, I still found myself sweating to dodge projectiles and maintain control over the platform edges, but I wasn’t having fun anymore. I remember MultiVersus originally being entertaining to pick up and play with friends for the simple yet consistently breezy chaos of each match. That feeling hasn’t returned with this reworked version of the game.</p>
<p>One big change that adds a bit of depth to the game is a new PvE Rift mode. Instead of queuing up for standard battles, you’re given thematic Chapters with webs of individual encounters to dive into, each with their own unique modifiers, hazards, and more. It’s a lot like the Spirit mode of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, giving you dozens of uniquely modified parameters under which to fight the various characters. Some battles have minor yet entertaining changes, like equipping you with infinite-jump Angel Wings or rendering the entire screen in Matrix-style green and black wireframe. Other stages throw entirely unique minigames at you, like getting in a jumprope competition or fending off a giant boss mech.</p>

<p>It’s paired with a new Gem system – beat Nodes in this mode to unlock and upgrade Gems of different categories that grant you a variety of minor combat buffs or ability changes. Some are basic boosts like a chance at receiving a 10% attack damage buff before battle, while others let you customize your character kit a bit by activating the powers of other characters. Early on I found a gem that triggered Black Adam’s lightning whenever I dodged with a full meter, adding some interesting new utility to that move. As far as I could tell, there wasn’t a mode available to take your Gem-equipped character into battle against other players – but even with this locked away in a singleplayer mode, it’s a pretty solid way to spend time with the game and get some experience with the systems and characters before you try to head online.</p>
<p>While the new singleplayer mode is a pretty significant addition for the game, MultiVersus ultimately doesn’t feel much better off from where it was just over a year ago. In some ways it actually feels worse – with combat feeling far more sluggish and lethargic than I ever remembered it being in the open beta version of the game. Hopefully these combat reworks aren’t set in stone, and the team can take on board feedback and readjust when this new and not-entirely-improved version of MultiVersus goes live on 28th May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-70-projects<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has released its financial statement for both the last fiscal year and the final quarter of said year, and it includes a tease for the impressive amount of projects the group currently has in its pipeline.</p>

<p>According to an Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, the group has more than 70 projects in the works across its many subsidiaries right now, and that number includes "at least three important unannounced titles".</p>

<p>Those projects are slated to be released across the next financial year, which ends in March 2025. The lineup includes games like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">was announced recently</a>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=2VCPE5D_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=MDFZBbV8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is just one of the 70-plus games Embracer Group is planning to release this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer says that across the year, it saw a 12% increase in sales, driven largely by its tabletop and entertainment sectors (although its gaming sectors also returned modest sales increases).</p>

<p>In gaming terms, those increases were driven by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered</em></a>, which Embracer says "performed above management expectations", as well as&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em>, which sold well despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">controversy surrounding its release</a>.</p>

<p>Another big earner for Embracer was&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>, with the&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp;</em>spinoff outperforming management's expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not all sunshine and roses, though. Some of the games released during this period underperformed, according to Embracer, including survival horror reboot&nbsp;<em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Outcast: A New Beginning</em>, a sequel to the 1999 cult classic open-world adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outcast-a-new-beginning-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=H2dhbAQA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outcast-a-new-beginning-embracer-group-financials.jpg?itok=sxwaoeN6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Outcast: A New Beginning&nbsp;</em>wasn't the success Embracer Group and THQ Nordic hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, Embracer announced its intention to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three separate entities</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends, and Asmodee (the latter of which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">inherit a pretty hefty euro debt</a> as a result).</p>

<p>Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says he's "confident" that this decision will unleash "significant untapped potential" within Embracer, and according to the latest report, the group's shareholders largely agree.</p>

<p>That untapped potential includes projects outside of the gaming space, including an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series that forms part of the brand's continuing expansion into streaming and film.</p>

<p>In gaming, Embracer's upcoming slate includes the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-develop-and-globally-publish-tomb-raider-game"><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game</a> currently being developed in conjunction with Amazon, as well as a new&nbsp;<em>Painkiller&nbsp;</em>title, the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition"><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake</a>, and <em>Metro Awakening</em>.</p>

<p>Affected studios include Gearbox, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in">sold to Take-Two in March</a>, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-saber-interactive"><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>publisher Saber Interactive</a>&nbsp;and more. Studios closed down by Embracer include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition"><em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer Volition</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>TimeSplitters&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/probable-images-of-free-radicals-timesplitters-game-revealed-after-studio-closure-by">Free Radical</a>.</p>

<p>Embracer acknowledges these closures and layoffs in its financial report, calling them "necessary but difficult decisions" and emphasizing the "compassion, respect and integrity" with which the layoffs and closures were apparently carried out.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA announced the new games added this week to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. The library now has over 1,900 games, including Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, which launched just a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Priority tier can enable NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution or NVIDIA DLAA as well as NVIDIA Reflex. GeForce NOW users subscribed to the Ultimate tier can also enable DLSS Frame Generation to get the best performance in the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In my review of the game</a>, I wrote:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<p>● Synergy (New release on Steam, May 21)<br>
● Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 21)<br>
● Crown Wars: The Black Prince (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Serum (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Ships at Sea (New release on Steam, May 23)<br>
● Exo One (Steam)<br>
● Phantom Brigade (Steam)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/paper-app-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever sat on a long journey, and thought, I wish I was roleplaying right now? Or gone camping or hiking and not wanted to take a huge board game or tons of RPG books? Lucy Duck Games and Tom Brinton have your back, with <em>Paper App Dungeon</em>, the travel roleplaying, dungeon exploring notebook.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-2.jpg?itok=u5wCEk_u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-2.jpg?itok=2nNUthll 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> box comes with a notebook and a special P6 pencil.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Do You Get With Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon</em> comes with a unique dungeon notebook, which are procedurally generated so that no two notebooks are the same, and a special P6 pencil. The P6 acts as your writing implement, and your dice, with 1 through 6 printed on the sides of it, which you roll to move during the game. The only issue is that the pencil can roll forever, especially if you're traveling. The idea of it is awesome, and it keeps the whole experience simple and portable, but I found myself using my own six-sided dice (D6) so that I didn't have to chase the pencil around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-3.jpg?itok=cVZkAUuF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-3.jpg?itok=RTrlgzC5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>notebook comes with 45 maps to play through.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>comes with the rules printed on the first three pages of the notebook, but a much more robust and easier-to-understand rulebook is available <a href="https://kind-jackson-99b826.netlify.app/files/Paper-Apps-DUNGEON-Guide.pdf">here</a>. For each map, you find the starting space and roll the P6. If you get 1, 3, or 5, you can move diagonally, 2, 4, or 6 and you move&nbsp;orthogonally. You have to move your complete distance rolled in a straight line, marking on the map as you go, and if you hit a wall, you can change directions.</p>

<p>On your travels, you will come across enemies, who take away your hit points, and treasure in the form of coins and chests. As you take damage or gain coins, you total them at the bottom of the page, and once you reach the exit, you total both up. If you have a negative health number, you start the next page with 10 health and 0 coins, but if you have a positive health number, you carry it over, along with your coins.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you can also come across stores, where you can increase your starting health, and also buy potions to use during maps. The final page in the book has a tally for your deaths and your final HP and Coin total, so you can compare them against your next <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> journey.</p>

<p>The challenge in <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> is predicting the dice rolls, and trying to avoid putting yourself in a position where you will move through enemies regardless of the roll. Sometimes calculated risks pay off, or if you know that between you and the exit are limited enemies (in our Floor 1 image below, you can see we headed straight through the enemy at the top of the map because it was a straight line to the exit after). T</p>

<p>There doesn't feel like a big payoff for taking risks for coins, because if you end up on negative health points at the end, you lose all of your coins, and even putting yourself on low health going into the next map makes that map even harder. You can play however you want, but I found that taking the simple routes, with calculated risks and minimal coins to keep my death tally down was the way I played through the maps.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-4.jpg?itok=n_sGSVcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-4.jpg?itok=GsYxwWZY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our first&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>adventure was very straightforward. Fought an enemy, got some loot, and made for the exit.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Long Is Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>includes 45 maps total to play through. Each one can take as little as a few minutes (if you roll well), or much longer if the dice are against you and you end up bouncing around tight rooms on the map. Because each map is procedurally generated, some can be very easy, and some have particularly testing moments, but that's the nature of adventuring, and nothing is fair in the gloom of the dungeon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-6.jpg?itok=7gEgqUPh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-app-dungeon-6.jpg?itok=Y2ibVX1y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The final page of the&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>notebook includes a tally tracker for deaths, along with your final health and gold total.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p><em>Paper App Dungeon </em>is a fun little game and incredible for travel adventures, or for introducing younger players to tabletop games. The P6 while a great concept, isn't great for travel, and can roll forever, so we ended up using a standard 6-sided dice. The rulebook, while well condensed into 3 pages at the front of the notebook, is much easier to understand in the full format we linked to above. Once understood, you won't require it again, but that initial read of the condensed 3 pages can be confusing. It's a fun little package though overall, and I will be picking up another next time I travel.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Paper App Dungeon?</h2>

<p>If you want a quick pick-up-and-play game for travel, or to introduce younger players, then <em>Paper App Dungeon</em> is perfect in terms of size, portability, fun, and ease of use (take your own dice with you on travel though). If you're looking for a roleplaying game or dungeon exploring board game with depth or character development, then&nbsp;<em>Paper App Dungeon </em>isn't that.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24162522/multiversus-relaunch-banana-guard-agent-smith-jason-vorhees</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162522/multiversus-relaunch-banana-guard-agent-smith-jason-vorhees<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0LQCJU">Warner Bros.’ fighting game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/9/13/23345074/multiversus-opinion-dodge-cooldown-meter-ui-player-first-games"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> returns on Tuesday, May 28 with its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23933735/multiversus-announcement-relaunch-release-date-warner-bros">long-awaited relaunch</a>. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789132/multiversus-warner-bros-dc-game-of-thrones-bugs-bunny">Super Smash Bros.-inspired platform fighter</a> is getting a big overhaul next week, with an expanded roster, new visuals, and improved netcode, which developer Player First Games designed to make online multiplayer matches feel just like local, four-folks-on-the-same-couch matches.</p>
<p id="saFRQT">There’s a long list of changes coming with the official launch of <em>MultiVersus</em> — the previous version was labeled an open beta, you see — and we’ll break down what’s new below.</p>
<h2 id="a0hbSW"><strong>New fighters</strong></h2>
<p id="48SUpV">Four new characters are confirmed for <em>MultiVersus</em> in season 1, which kicks off May 28. They are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155348/multiversus-joker-gameplay-mark-hamill-powerpuff-girls">DC’s Joker</a> (once again voiced by Mark Hamill), <em>Adventure Time</em>’s Banana Guard, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160800/multiversus-trailer-matrix-agent-smith-jason-voorhees"><em>Friday the 13th</em>’s Jason Voorhees, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s Agent Smith</a>.</p>
<p id="jvfzn2">Tony Huynh, Player First Games co-founder and game director on <em>MultiVersus</em>, told Polygon in a video interview that Joker is “full of gadgets” and steeped in references to the long history of the character. “We’re realizing that character in a way that I think fans of the Joker will be extremely happy with,” Huynh said. Joker is a mage-type fighter, a class that is currently “not really well-represented in <em>MultiVersus</em>,” Huynh said, “and so [he] also pushes our diversity of the player experience pretty far.”</p>
<div id="N2fV7H"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sT1zXiYqcfA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="sEueKJ">Banana Guard may be the most unexpected new addition to <em>MultiVersus</em>, given that <em>Adventure Time</em> is already represented in the game by Finn the Human and Jake the Dog. Huynh said that Banana Guard’s addition to the roster came from “an individual on our team that was very passionate about [the character],” and shows that “anything’s possible” in <em>MultiVersus</em>. “We aren’t just going to do the expected,” Huynh said. </p>
<p id="GWieaN">Banana Guard will be free at launch for players who complete the game’s new tutorial. A Lady Banana Guard variant will also be free to unlock.</p>
<p id="Mvqe3F">Jason Voorhees brings a new tank-class character to the <em>MultiVersus</em> roster. Jason will be big, and more importantly <em>heavy</em>, dwarfed only by the Iron Giant. “The big challenge there is, if you understand [the fighting game] genre, is that large characters are typically not viable, but [we] looked at it from that experience, like, ‘How <em>do</em> we make a viable large character in the game?’” Huynh said. “And I think we’ve done a really good job of that.”</p>
<p id="N7H2iw">Jason will be available through the game’s season 1 premium battle pass.</p>
<p id="s0Zwhv">Details on Agent Smith are still forthcoming. The recurring villain of The Matrix franchise is due to arrive sometime during season 1 of <em>MultiVersus</em>.</p>
<h2 id="gMMDfu"><strong>New visuals and new netcode</strong></h2>
<div id="byQ4zu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1Yx-Cz0l9U?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="bR2DMf">Player First Games says it has rebuilt <em>MultiVersus</em> from the ground up. That includes a tech upgrade, moving from Epic Games’ Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. Expect better-looking, larger characters and improved lighting.</p>
<p id="PJXqxg">More important, from a competitive standpoint, is <em>MultiVersus</em>’ new multiplayer netcode. That means the fighting game community’s tech solution of choice: rollback netcode. Here’s how Player First Games explains it:</p>
<blockquote><p id="RPMgIZ">Simply put, rollback netcode still sends player inputs back and forth, but each button press is accompanied by a precise timestamp, marking the exact moment of activation. This allows the client to reconstruct what would have happened had it received the input at the intended time. By leaping backward, then instantaneously simulating back to where you were, the game delivers an experience that feels smooth and enjoyable. With rollback netcode you’re seeing exactly the same thing as your opponent, meaning that their position and frames of animation are always updated to the most accurate position which continues to be predicted from there.</p></blockquote>
<p id="wrUshn">Huynh told Polygon that the game’s open beta period “really was about us learning as much as possible,” and that the dev team did learn a lot. “Now we have absolute world-class netcode,” he said, “so that players can play with their friends all across the country, and have just an amazing experience that almost feels offline.” Based on my hands-on with a pre-release version of <em>MultiVersus</em>’ new netcode, Player First has delivered. Even intercontinental matches felt surprisingly smooth and lag-free.</p>
<h2 id="RC0wXt"><strong>Rifts, a new PvE mode</strong></h2>
<div id="WA8Yn3"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3h4Zex58TLo?rel=0&amp;start=93" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="YsdzhE">For players just getting their feet wet in <em>MultiVersus</em> (and those who may want some less-heated competition) there’s something new: rifts, aka battles against computer-controlled opponents. Rifts will provide seasonal challenges and bits of narrative for the game’s ongoing story. Here’s how Player First explains the new PvE mode:</p>
<blockquote><p id="gp8jDO">Each Rift will have a sequence of battles or challenges around a particular theme, whether it’s The Joker infiltrating the Batcave or Batman and Velma teaming up to decide who’s the best detective. These themes will be organized around seasonal “Attunements,” such as Chaos<em>,</em> for the Clown Prince of Crime that is joining our cast in season 1. The same way every <em>MultiVersus</em> battle is bubbling with character interactions, we wanted to make each Rift “uniquely <em>MultiVersus,</em>” every season.    </p></blockquote>
<p id="E29chx">Rifts will have built-in cinematics and story elements, with “characters interacting with each other, tons of minigames, [for] a really diverse kind of experience,” Huynh said. “I think it does a really good job of teaching players how to play the game as well, but also has a lot of novel kind of experiences.”</p>
<p id="Q9VX2y">Player First promises to keep developing and expanding Rifts: “Anything that we can imagine, we can build, and deliver that [...] to players,” Huynh said. He added that, thanks to the game’s new netcode, <em>MultiVersus</em> Rifts can be played in their entirety cooperatively with friends.</p>

<p id="s3SmRc">Players who spent real money on <em>MultiVersus</em>’ premium currency, Gleamium, during the game’s open beta will keep that currency, which can be spent on character unlocks and future premium battle passes. Players will also retain character tokens and battle pass tokens earned during the open beta, but Player First and Warner Bros. will no longer offer those currencies.</p>
<p id="g5k0yT">With <em>MultiVersus</em>’ relaunch, in addition to Gleamium, there will be three new currencies:</p>
<ul>
<li id="WPANyb">
<strong>Fighter currency</strong>, which can be earned in-game and used to obtain fighters</li>
<li id="01Acix">
<strong>Perk currency</strong>, which can be earned in-game and be spent on perks, power-ups that players can attach to characters to give them buffs during combat</li>
<li id="tDEkuI">
<strong>Prestige currency</strong>, which rewards players for all of the items and cosmetics they collect for their favorite fighters. “Each cosmetic item you acquire awards its own Prestige currency value based on type and rarity,” <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-welcome-back-rewards-battle-pass-and-economy-changes">Player First wrote in a blog post</a>. “Eventually, you’ll use your Prestige currency to unlock Prestige cosmetics, which represent the rarest cosmetics in the game. These items can only be unlocked using Prestige currency.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mCgLTR"><strong>Will MultiVersus still be free to play when it relaunches?</strong></h2>
<p id="B4iAb1">Yes. The <em>MultiVersus</em> relaunch will be a free download on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. The game will be monetized through premium battle pass purchases and through direct purchases of Gleamium.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/atari/status/1793616648890470410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, Atari announced that it has officially acquired the Intellivision “brand and game library.” </p>



<p>Atari CEO Wade Rosen added that the acquisition is a “rare opportunity to unite former competitors.” Rosen also says it can “bring together fans of the golden age of gaming.” Intellivision will rebrand, but it will still continue distributing the Amico console.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/23/2887219/0/en/Atari-Acquires-Intellivision-Brand.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wide press release</a>, Atari elaborated on the acquisition. Atari plans to “expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games” and “potentially create new games.” </p>



<p>Fans will likely recognize Intellivision for its classic arcade titles, such as the home port of BurgerTime. Notably, Atari only purchased “certain games,” and did not identify the titles involved. </p>



<p>Atari will surely reveal more soon, since the purchase included rights to over 200 titles. It is also already selling merchandise with Intellivision T-shirts.</p>



<p>In today’s press release, Atari also confirmed it will “explore brand and licensing opportunities.” </p>



<p>Intellivision Entertainment CEO Phil Adam expressed trust in Atari regarding its brand. Adam also said that Intellivision looks forward to an “expanded collaboration,” including “a broad array of new Atari and Intellivision titles.”</p>



<p>Late last April, Atari also decided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revive Infogrames</a> as a publishing label. The move intends to gain IP and publish games outside of Atari’s core portfolio of games. Accordingly, Infogrames even purchased Totally Reliable Delivery Services from tinyBuild.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog co-president Neil Druckmann has teased the company's next game and discussed how he believes artificial intelligence can help shape the future of video game development.</p><p>In an<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> interview on Sony's website</a>, Druckmann said he's working on potentially the "most thrilling" game he's ever been part of. He didn't share specifics, but he said he believes it could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming." He didn't elaborate on that point specifically, but he did highlight how the success of HBO's The Last of US TV show demonstrates that there is a growing fondness for gaming that "transcends all age groups," which is a marked contrast from when Druckmann was growing up.</p><p>"This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers. This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us," he said.</p><p>Naughty Dog is working on multiple games currently, and they have been described as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">ambitious" and "brand-new."</a> These will be single-player games. Naughty Dog previously planned to expand into multiplayer in a big way with its The Last of Us multiplayer game, but it was ultimately canceled.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann spoke optimistically--as many have before him--about the prospects for how AI can potentially positively impact video game development in the future.</p><p>"AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address," he said. "With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles."</p><p>He added: "AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities. However, it's crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><p>Naughty Dog's new games have not been announced yet, and there is no word on when they might be. Many believe there could be another PlayStation Showcase event on tap soon, but Sony has yet to confirm anything on that front. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>As for the HBO series, The Last of Us Season 2 is filming now and is expected to release in 2025.</p>

You’ll do this by taking requests from customers in the store, helping them solve their problems with the artifacts you’ve procured so far, and uncovering as much information as you can about the local town, Undermere. </p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true">There are books to leaf through in search of clues, information, and references you can use as you explore Undermere to help the locals in any way you can. The visuals make the game look like a cozy shop simulator, and I’m looking forward to seeing and feeling how the juxtaposition with cosmic horror elements pays off in action. I didn’t expect fishing and cosmic horror to go together so well in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dredge-indie-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-s-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dredge</a>,</em> so I’m hopeful this game will suck me right in. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">The game is a sequel to <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, taking place years after its story came to a close. However, <em>Stange Antiquities</em> is designed to be a standalone experience, so you don’t need to have played the first game to enjoy it. However, it’s probably worth doing so just to see how the town has evolved. </p> <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">With almost 10,000 positive reviews on Steam and over 500,000 copies sold, Bad Viking considers <em>Stange Horticulture</em> a massive success for an independent game developer. It hopes to live up to the reputation it built with that game and deliver yet another title that fans of the first will enjoy, but also welcome newcomers into its strange, cosmic horror-inspired world. </p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false">There is no release date for the game at the time of writing, but you can wishlist it on Steam to keep up to date with all the news and hear about any release windows as they are announced. </p>

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are lots of side quests in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and because you are likely to run into the Hero of the Leap quest at a random point, you might be very, very confused as you try to complete it. </p> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="170" data-injectable="false">One of the steps in the quest is to use the sensor to find the optimal route, but you might not even have the sensor yet. If this has happened to you, I can help you out.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-use-the-sensor-for-the-optimal-route-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to use the sensor for the optimal route in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">You can find the <strong>Hero of the Leap quest</strong> in the center of Jinzhou. A young man by the name of Dashbon can be found near the pools in the town, and he will tell you about great heroes who used to jump from roof to roof in the city. He will then give you the chance to follow in their footsteps and take on the Overdash challenge.</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">If you agree, you will be teleported to the top of a building and will need to make your way across the rooftops of the city. If you touch the ground at all, then it will restart. At this point, you can use the sensor to see the optimal route, but only if you actually have the sensor.</p> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="855" data-injectable="true">If you don’t have the sensor yet, you need to continue through the main quest and do the <strong>Echoing Marche quest</strong>. As you play through this quest, you will meet a young guard at a small base outside Jinzhou. He will ask you to keep an eye out for a missing person, and this is when you get the sensor. You will be able to switch to the center by bringing up your Utility Wheel by using the Tab key on the keyboard or the left D-Pad button. Make sure it is set to Utility and not Function. In this wheel, you will find the Sensor, which will look like a small eye icon.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="863" data-injectable="false">Select it, and it will then map to your controls the same way the grapple hook does. you can hold the left should button on the controller and then hit the Y button to use it. This will reveal the optimal route to you when you are performing the challenge in the Hero of the Leap quest and make your life much easier. Remember, you only need to have the grapple equipped to be able to use it for anything other than a prompted spot. If you have the sensor on, you can still grapple to the top of buildings and lamps with ease as long as you hover over the prompt.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-dlss-3-fsr-3-fixes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut post-launch patch is now live on PC, introducing stability improvements and fixes for some NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/4160841636412305229?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1053.0.0522.1042 patch</a> focuses on improving stability and fixing some NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 issues. Specifically, the patch fixes visual bugs that could show when transitioning from cutscenes to gameplay with DLSS 3 Frame Generation enabled, and fixed other visual issues that could show when combining AMD FSR 3 upscaling with Dynamic Resolution Scaling.</p>
<p>This Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is only going the first one, as Nixxes and Sucker Punch confirmed they are working hard on future patches that will address issues raised by the community and further improve stability on specific hardware configurations for both the single-player campaign and the Legends multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Despite some users having stability issues, Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut managed to become the most successful PlayStation launch on Steam, setting a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sets-new-concurrent-player-peak-record-for-sonys-single-player-games-on-steam/">concurrent player peak record for Sony's single-player games on Steam</a>, soundly beating the previous record holder, God of War. With Helldivers II also doing incredibly well, it's clear that Sony is finding more success with its PC releases, hopefully convincing the company to release their former PlayStation exclusives on PC sooner than it has been doing these past few years.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4.
