            <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year to some critical acclaim, and it has now made its way both west and onto PC. The PC version has a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2731870/announcements/detail/4554919920318276609">bunch of graphical upgrades</a> and keyboard support, but also - unlike predecessor Ys IX: Monstrum Nox which got co-op as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">a cheeky post-launch bonus on PC</a> - Ys X: Nordics has local co-op from day one.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ys X again stars pretty boy protagonist Adol, but this time is teamed-up with pirate Karja. Yes, that means there's ship-shaped exploration and combat. If you don't have a co-op buddy to play with, you can switch between both characters on the fly or control them together, and build their "Revenge Guage" to do combined attacks.

<p>The Ys series started all the way back in the '80, but it's been gaining in popularity in recent years, particularly on PC. Monstrum Nox was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/japanese-games-dominated-steams-july-top-sellers">a Steam best seller in July 2021</a>, and genre expert Nadia Oxford <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ys-ix-monstrum-nox-is-the-perfect-place-for-newcomers-to-take-a-vampiric-leap-into-the-series">thought it was the perfect entrypoint to the series</a>. 
</p><p>I am yet to make my own entrance into the Ys series, and I confess, I've never fought a naval battle I've enjoyed. If I want to slowly circle an enemy I do not understand while taking potshots at it, then I will write news posts about RPG series I've never played, thanks. I do wish I had time to experience its blue skies and grappling hooks, though. Maybe if I ever finish Ni no Kuni. 
</p>
<p>Ys X: Nordics is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2731870/Ys_X_Nordics/">available from Steam</a>. It's £55/€60/$60 and there's a demo where your save can carry over to the full game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> received its final piece of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-cities-skylines-expansion-adds-hotels-and-tourist-resorts">last May</a>, as developers Colossal Order shifted their focus to its sequel, Cities: Skylines 2. Eighteen months and the release of Cities: Skylines 2 later... Cities: Skylines 1 is getting new DLC again.
</p>
<p>The "Mountain Village" creator pack add 45 new buildings designed to help you construct quaint and picturesque destinations.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Many of Cities: Skylines DLCs were created by community members and that's the case here, but developers Colossal Order have also been hands-off when it comes to implementing the work in-game.
</p>
<p>"We want to reassure those of you that play Cities: Skylines II, that the development of this new content for Cities: Skylines is an entirely separate effort. The content you’ll find in this release for Cities: Skylines has been implemented by Tantalus, the studio who managed the console ports for Cities: Skylines," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651">the pack's announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines II for this - our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines II. This approach allows us to release some updates without compromising on either game."
</p><p>Cities: Skylines 2 launched in a rough state last year, beset by both bugs and performance issues. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">There have been improvements since</a>, but still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">the first DLC pack was so poorly received</a> that players were refunded and everybody had to apologise.
</p>
<p>For those reasons, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">Paradox's many other recent missteps</a>, I think it'd be easy to view a return to Cities: Skylines DLC as a kind of retreat. I actually think this is great, though. A lot of people own and love the first Cities: Skylines and many can't move to the sequel even if they wanted to, so why shouldn't a publisher continue to serve that audience. More folks should do the same.

<p>I spent much of my time in the late '90s and early '00s downloading user-made levels for first-person shooters like Half-Life and the Quakes. Sometimes from Fileplanet, sometimes directly from whatever random dedicated server I'd just selected from the browser. These levels almost always had an incomplete grasp of the affordances of the game - or even more charitably, were more interested in gimmicks than in balance.
</p><p>What-ifs, basically. What if the level was just a big room with sight lines divided by pillars? What if there were no weapons on the level except for crossbows? What if the players started at opposite ends of a corridor with a single weapon in between them, a shotgun, which both have to race towards? What if players could reach a raised platform via a teleporter, and that was the only way up there, and there was, like, respawning grenades? What if a level sort of looked like that curtain room from Twin Peaks?
</p>
<p>I'm talking about the brutal teenaged logic that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-legacy-of-fy_iceworld-counter-strikes-divisive-and-hugely-popular-custom-map">leads to fy_iceworld</a>. The answer to these questions is almost always: players will instantly find the unstoppable strategy, and the whole experience will become a race towards that unassailable position.
</p>
<p>Yet there remains an irresistible appeal to these levels. That's why they're gimmicks. 
</p>
<p>Straftat builds a framework around these sorts of levels that turns them effectively into Mario Party mini-games. Fights are always 1v1, two kills wins a round, and the first to five rounds wins the match. The levels are small and players are agile, able to perform bumslides, leans and mantling, meaning fights never last much longer than a minute. Being dominated in a fight? Don't worry, you'll be onto the next one in 90 seconds. Don't like a level? Don't worry, there are 70 of them and I'm yet to see the same one twice - and players can create playlists of their favourite maps.
</p><p>There's another experience from those halcyon days of server-hopping Straftat has recreated for me: that of making a single-server friend. I'm not going to lie, it takes some perseverence to find a Straftat match that doesn't immediately close when you join. (By which I mean, it takes a few minutes of clicking servers in the browser - and thus is still preferable to the oft-long queues of modern matchmaking.)
</p>
<p>When you do find someone to play with, I've often stayed with them for several matches in a row. There's proximity voice chat, but I'm yet to turn it on. Instead, when dumped into the post-match room in which a winner is declared, and in which music blares, every opponent and I have leaned and crouched at each other, in a celebratory manner I take to mean "Hello" and "Good game". 
</p>
<p>I've missed these dumb and oddly intimate moments with strangers, just as I've missed double-clicking on a server and excitedly wondering what daft .bsp world I was about to enter into. 
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">Straftat from Steam now</a>. It's completely free, although you can spend a few quid on a DLC that doubles the number of maps and adds some cosmetics.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Obbe Vermeij, former Rockstar developer and sharer of secrets, has revealed an intriguing tidbit about Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the game’s 20th anniversary. The developer – who still works in the industry today – is known far and wide across social media for his insights and behind-the-scenes glimpses at the development of many Grand Theft Auto games.</p>



<p>His latest factoid about San Andreas is pretty interesting, and it comes as the game celebrates a major milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-20-years-as-the-goat">20 Years as the GOAT</h2>



<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is considered one of the best games of all time. It’s a memorable, expansive adventure that took players across a series of cities that made up ‘San Andreas’. It was one of the games that defined a generation, and for Rockstar, it was a dizzying success that served as a benchmark for things to come.</p>



<p>Recently, Obbe Vermeij, who worked on GTA 3, GTA Vice City, San Andreas, and GTA IV, took to social media to reflect on twenty years of San Andreas history.</p>



<p>He wrote that the original plan was to have the game map split up into three separate portions, only reachable by inter-city travel made up of trains and planes. This would enable the team to circumvent ‘tight’ memory restrictions, and it would be easier to differentiate between separate assets needed to make each city feel unique.</p>



<p>In the end, an executive meeting at Rockstar North changed the path of history and settled on one huge map that was tougher to develop but much more impressive overall.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>20 years ago we released Grand Theft Auto – San Andreas.</p><p>The original plan was for the 3 cities to be on separate maps. The player would travel between the cities using trains and planes.<br>(Gta 1 and 2 also had three cities on separate maps)</p><p>Memory was very tight on the ps2 and… <a href="https://t.co/kUMxR9Kt96">pic.twitter.com/kUMxR9Kt96</a></p></div>— Obbe Vermeij (@ObbeVermeij) <a href="https://twitter.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1849940437596787037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Vermeij then went on to reminisce about midnight launches and how impressive it was that San Andreas pulled in such massive crowds before the internet and social media allowed developers and publishers to generate much of a buzz.</p>



<p>Back then, it would have been a couple of TV spots, a trailer or two, and perhaps an article here and there in a magazine or one of the few websites around at the time:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The internet was crap and apart from a couple of trailers, gamers didn’t know too much about the game. </p>



<p>I went to the biggest store near the R*North offices, which was HMV on Princess Street, Edinburgh. Even though it was a drizzly night, the line meandered all through the store and spilled out onto the street.</p>



<p>It was mind-blowing to see all those people so excited, going home to play the game all through the night.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GTA: San Andreas was my first ‘launch day game’ back in 2004, and I poured thousands of hours into it over the years that followed. It’s a masterpiece, and it’ll always have a place in my heart.</p>

            <p>YouTube has denied Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm's appeal to monetise his channel for a further 60 days.</p>
<p>Addressing his audience in a livestream in a clip shared to X/Twitter, Beahm revealed YouTube had deferred his appeal "for another 60 days" after which he'd be eligible to re-apply.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Beahm cannot draw any revenue from subscriptions or advertisements on his channel, which has 4.5m subscribers.</p>

<p>"Actually Champs - unfortunately, they pushed it back another 60 days," Beahm said. "Believe it or not, they waited 'til the very last second last night to tell us, uh, 'we're going to, uh, extend, just for another 60 days, and then you'll be eligible to re-apply, and we'll review the application'.</p>
<p>"But you know what, though, Champs? Okay. Then let's just wait another 60 days."</p>
<p>He then said he had something "something much, much bigger" in the works - "one of the biggest opportunity to date" - but didn't elaborate (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dr-disrespect-guy-beahm-twitch-youtube-streamer-appeal-request-video-monetisation-denied/">TheGamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Back in June, Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p><p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel… which we now know has been denied.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US Copyright Office has determined that it <strong>will not </strong>alter existing DMCA rules to allow for the preservation of video games in repositories and archives across the country. This news comes following a three-year battle by the Video Game History Foundation to desperately find a path to preservation for games that are in danger of being lost forever.</p>



<p>Previously, the organisation revealed that around 87% of all games released before 2010 are ‘virtually inaccessible’ owing to changes in technology, consumer habits, retail operating models, and the simple passing of time.</p>

<h2 id="h-remember-them">Remember Them</h2>



<p>Many gamers appreciate a blast from the past – it’s why some games do so well when they are remade, or when modern variants introduce elements from past releases.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG, I’m looking at you.</p>



<p>If we go beyond that and look at <strong>true </strong>nostalgia – retro gaming – we enter a vast world filled with consoles, games, and peripherals from yesteryear, all of which are steadily falling into an abyss due to a lack of <strong>official preservation practices</strong>. While books, movies, music, and the like are all preserved under DMCA law, video games have never fallen into a legitimate category.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-24563.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the retort</a> published by the US Copyright Office, which leant on comments made by the Entertainment Software Association, it was said that the petition from the VGHF was kicked because they:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… did not propose a clear requirement to know who the users are or why they want to access a game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier, the ESA said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Enabling widespread remote access to preserved games with minimal supervision would present a serious risk to an important market.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Video Game History Foundation insists it’s not finished with its crusade, but the rules are relatively black and white right now. In an ideal world, a digital repository of archived games would exist for users to check them out and access their contents through emulation platforms, but it admittedly becomes quite hard to police who is accessing them, and when, and <strong>where</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think video games need to be preserved in this way, or should the retro collector market be enough to suffice? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"Our biggest update of the 20th century arrives this December when Warframe: 1999 launches on all platforms!" the studio said, before inviting players to "get your account ready" for launch day… whenever that may be.</p>
<p>For anyone struggling to wait that long, don't forget that a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.warframe.com%2Fget-ready">playable demo</a> is still available.</p>
<p>"Get a feel for Arthur's Weaponry and turbo-charged Atomicycle as you battle Scaldra through the streets of Hӧllvania," DE teases. "December just can't come soon enough…"</p>
<p>As our resident Warframe expert Matt summarised for us recently, we've known 1999 was likely to be an "odd 'un" ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a>.</p>
<p>As TennoCon 2024 revealed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-1999-expansion-has-a-shopping-mall-romance-system-and-you-even-get-to-fight-a-boyband">it's really set in 1999 (New Year's Eve, to be exact)</a> and no, this isn't quite the Earth we know - but it's close enough, full of extremely familiar era-appropriate artefacts that feel gleefully incongruous within Warframe's wider world. And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s latest content update, and the terrible drop rate for god rolls on its hottest weapon, has some fans certain that there’s a statistical disadvantage for that drop to occur. The result is a compelling conspiracy theory about how loot drops actually work in <em>Destiny 2</em>, and given that the community has the statistics to back it up, Bungie is now conducting its own investigation.

<p>The Season One Battle Pass for Black Ops 6 is sure to be a momentous occasion, bringing with it a ton of exciting Operator Skins, Emblems, Calling Cards, and new Weapons. We’re here to take a look at the latest details on the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass and its potential release date.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is continuing on with the successful live-service, seasonal model of its predecessors. Battle Passes aren’t going anywhere anytime soon: They add to the longevity of each CoD season, give you more to grind for, and if you’re thorough and play enough to earn all the CoD Points, you can pretty much pay for your next pass—<em>for free</em>.</p>



<p>Details have already leaked regarding Black Ops and Warzone Season 1, so delve into Battle Pass talk.</p>

<p>Activision has yet to formally announce the Black Ops 6 Season 1 Battle Pass date; however, based on a Call of Duty and Caesers Pizza promotional crossover, <strong>Nov. 14</strong> looks to be the date Activision has penciled in for the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-one-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One date</a> was spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@BobBetworkUK_</a> on Oct. 21, and they provided a screenshot, with a caption saying, “<strong>Black Ops 6 x Warzone Season 1 starts November 14th</strong>.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Caesers Pizza has already proven to be a great partner for Call of Duty fans by offering players the chance to grab <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a>. Now, you can start planning for Nov. 14, and get some pizza in for the start of Season One.</p>



<p>Naturally, the Season One Battle Pass is expected to go live at the same time as the new seasonal content. Long-story short, brace yourselves for the likely debut of the Black Ops 6 Battle Pass on Nov. 14!</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-what-s-in-the-black-ops-6-season-one-battle-pass">Do we know what’s in the Black Ops 6 Season One Battle Pass?</h2>



<p>Due to there being no official release date for Black Ops 6, we don’t know any of the content Activison has in store for Season One.</p>



<p>We do know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown is coming to Black Ops 6</a>, <strong>but it won’t be part of the Season One content drop</strong>—the legendary map is returning on Nov. 1 to broaden the multiplayer’s large pool of maps.</p>



<p>For now, we anticipate the usual slew of contents usually seen in a mainline CoD content drop: New maps, new playlist game modes, new Operator Skins and cosmetics, new weapons, and of course, the Season One Battle Pass.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we’ll be sure to update you once Activision does finally announce the Season one roadmap for BLOPS 6 and Warzone Season One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than most genres, survival horror feels rooted in time. It started with the methodical <em>Resident Evil</em> on the original PlayStation and is defined in part by limitation — a slow pace, grimy visuals, and scant resources to help amplify the scares. Many of those elements stemmed from the early, awkward days of 3D gaming, whether it was <em>Resident Evil</em>’s clunky controls, which made zombie chases more terrifying, or <em>Silent Hill</em>’s fog, which lent an iconic atmosphere while also letting the developers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/playstation/24196061/silent-hill-crash-bandicoot-tech-limitations">get around technical limitations of the time</a>.</p><p>And a few decades later, developers are still finding ways to bring the most important elements of those games — namely, the mood and scares — to modern horror without feeling dated.</p><p>The most obvious way to do this is keeping the style and tone of classic survival horror while updating the gameplay to make it more approachable. The most recent example of this is <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>, the first release from horror movie studio Blumhouse’s new gaming label. Much like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox"><em>Crow Country</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23428239/signalis-review-ps4-xbox-switch-pc"><em>Signalis</em></a>, it’s a game that looks like it was ripped right out of 1998; the visuals are blocky, the textures low-res. It gives the experience a grimy feel, which is just the right note for horror.</p><div><figcaption><em>Fear the Spotlight.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Blumhouse Games</cite></p></div><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> — developed by the two-person team at Cozy Game Pals — starts out simple enough, with two friends breaking into their high school to perform a seance in the library. But, of course, things go bad, and they get pulled into a nightmare realm that connects both to their own pasts and a dark mystery the school has been hiding for decades. It’s part coming-of-age story, part romance, and part true crime. But it’s all rendered in the crunchy style of PlayStation-era horror, which lends it an uneasy edge.</p><p>The game also lets you really focus on the story by streamlining the gameplay. There’s <em>a lot</em> of puzzle-solving; much like in early <em>Resident Evil</em> games, you’ll be fixing all kinds of complex mechanical problems and dealing with arcane statues and locks. But there’s almost no actual combat. Instead, you have little choice but to run and hide when the terrifying monsters appear. Some of the scariest moments of the game have you huddled under a desk, waiting for the creatures — which have deadly spotlights for faces — to pass.</p><p>In some ways, removing combat makes the game even scarier since you have no way to fight back. These moments in <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> reminded me a bit of stowing away in a locker in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"><em>Alien: Isolation</em></a>, hoping the xenomorph couldn’t see me. The hazy, dirty visuals only amplify this feeling, as it’s often difficult to get a clear view of what’s ahead of you.</p><div><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Konami</cite></p></div><p>On the other side of the spectrum is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168204/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-date-ps5-steam">recent remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em></a>. Instead of creating a brand-new survival horror experience with modern sensibilities, it’s an attempt to take one of the genre’s most influential titles — a particularly idiosyncratic one at that — and reimagine it as a big-budget release in 2024. That has pros and cons. Like the remakes of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc">classic <em>Resident</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"><em>Evil</em> games</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23567481/dead-space-remake-ea-motive-ps5-xbox-pc-review">the original <em>Dead Space</em></a>, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> looks and plays like a modern release. The visuals are crisp and detailed, instead of hazy and disorienting. And it controls like a well-tuned third-person action game. It’s immensely satisfying to swing a bat, whether you’re smashing in windows or fending off a living mannequin.</p><p>There’s a shift in tone. The modern <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is still scary. The level of realism makes the squirming enemies and cramped hotel hallways feel incredibly unsettling, and there’s a level of immersion that can be panic-inducing. But now it plays and feels like a lot of other games and is, for lack of a better word, a lot cleaner than the original. It’s no longer as weird and distinct. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16978294/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-remaster-ps4-review">the 2018 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a>: a cover song that doesn’t replace the original but provides a different way of looking at it, one that’s welcoming for newcomers. (If only Konami made the original <em>Silent Hill 2</em> more accessible.)</p><p>The point is, these games show there is still plenty of room to do interesting things with survival horror. And they do it in a way that both connected to the genre’s history without being stifled by it. More importantly: they find new ways to scare.</p><p><small><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> and <em>Silent Hill 2</em> are both available now.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>After a year, Finnish studio Remedy Entertainment has opened the gates to a mysterious location in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the 2023 third-person horror hit <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, known as <em>The Lake House</em>. In this short DLC, released just in time for Halloween, players step into the shoes of Kiran Estevez, the long-suffering agent of the mysterious Federal Bureau of Control we meet in the main game, who allies with <em>Alan Wake 2’s</em> protagonists, Alan Wake and Saga Anderson. Set before the events of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>The Lake House</em> sees Kiran recounting a horrifying event at the titular location to Saga, yet the plot is almost firmly removed from the main game itself.</p><p>This is both a boon and a curse, depending on what you were looking for. But as a bridge to the continuation of Remedy’s grand connected universe narrative — which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">the supernatural thriller <em>Control</em></a> — it’s ideal. Instead of waving goodbye to Alan and Saga, Remedy is extending a hand to take us on its next weird journey.</p><p>Kiran is investigating a research station, where FBC researchers, doctors Jules and Diana Marmont and their teams, are looking into the effects of Cauldron Lake. In Remedy’s lore, there is a connection between the power of creating “art” and the power of otherworldly forces to misuse such gifts.</p><p>The Marmonts are experimenting on a painter, Rudolf Lane, who some might remember from the main game. Lane’s creativity has a tendency to illustrate — and possibly create — the future, much as Alan’s writing did. (God forbid those two ever make a comic book together.)&nbsp;I won’t spoil what the Marmonts did, save to say they were monsters long before any otherworldly forces came into the frame. Regardless, the Lake House is suddenly cut off and unresponsive to FBC HQ, resulting in Kiran investigating with a small team.&nbsp;</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>Remedy has been playing with a connected universe since <em>Control</em>, and the Lake House is a firm bridge backward and forward to that story. Of course, being an <em>Alan Wake</em> DLC, players can expect the solid third-person survival horror of the main game.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lake House, as a setting, is as unnerving as most of the spaces in A<em>lan Wake 2</em>. However, there’s more of a focus on the brutalist and office-space aesthetics from <em>Control</em>, without the outside or natural environments that dominated about half of the main game. In the eerily quiet office spaces, there are visual wonders like looping hallways and rooms of infinite typewriters, which have been programmed to “write” like Alan Wake.&nbsp;</p><p>That last quirk appears to be a clear jab by Remedy’s writers at AI slop, with a page of Alan’s real writing saying, “The art was not art. Just content for the experiment.” Indeed, the whole thesis of <em>The Lake House</em> is the misuse of art for the acquisition of some end product, rather than relishing in the beauty art can create. This is all the more obvious when you figure out who the villain is and who has created the new terrifying humanoid paint beasts that slither out of the walls. Remedy is not subtle in its disdain for the corporatization of creativity, the reconfiguration of art into a harvest field of bland capitalistic fervor. There’s no love lost and much hate gained in the <em>Lake House</em>’s story, outlining the interaction between artistic freedom and corporate control: a golden hand wrapped around imagination’s throat.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>To say too much about this already short game would spoil it, so I won’t go into detail about the clever set pieces that would feel right at home in <em>Control</em>. Let’s just say, light switches and motels make a welcome return, as does a familiar and powerful character.&nbsp;</p><p>Kiran, unfortunately, does not mechanically demonstrate any prowess fighting otherworldly beings, despite her years as an FBC agent. She plays no different to Saga or Alan Wake, once again using a flashlight to whittle down enemies’ shadowy armor before unloading a satisfying number of bullets into their bodies. There is also only one new enemy type: the aforementioned long-limbed painting creatures who can only be destroyed with a new weapon Kiran discovers late in the story.&nbsp;</p><p>I would’ve liked some new ability or mechanic that demonstrates her years of experience in dealing with the weird. Instead, this is relegated to her interactions with the odd object / entity, being able to quickly control her fear, and knowing how to deal with recurring “items” <em>Control</em> veterans like myself know all too well.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of the joy of the Lake House is discovering what occurred and experiencing the few floors for yourself. The DLC takes about two hours to complete. But in that short span of time, it made for not only a satisfying send-off of one of my favorite recent games but also a bridge back into the world of <em>Control</em>.</p><p>All signs seem to indicate Remedy will be taking the grand plot of this connected universe to an almost apocalyptic level. We can probably expect to see plenty of returning characters, including Kiran herself, as Remedy steers us through its creepy weird lake of stories.</p><p><small>The Lake House<em> expansion for </em>Alan Wake 2<em> is available now.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
