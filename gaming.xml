On Wednesday, CyberPowerPC <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041?s=20">announced that it plans</a> to adjust the pricing across all of its systems on December 7th, as <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/cyberpowerpc-is-latest-system-builder-to-hike-prices-over-soaring-dram">reported earlier by <em>PCMag</em></a>.</p><p>“Recently, global memory (RAM) prices have surged by 500% and SSD prices have risen by 100%,” CyberPowerPC says in a statement posted on X. “This has had a direct impact on the cost of building gaming PCs since 10/1/25.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Maingear is trying to stave off price increases for as long as it can. “I anticipate that the prices will continue to rise and then we will eventually have to increase our lead times as stock and allocation becomes constrained, but we are in constant communication with our vendors and will delay these increases for as long as we possibly can,” Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a>.</p><p>The price of RAM has fluctuated greatly over the past month as AI companies buy up more RAM and data storage for their sprawling data centers. Some physical stores have resorted to pricing the components at market prices, not unlike how seafood restaurants sell the catch-of-the-day. <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993431465150046577?s=20">CyberPowerPC </a>predicts that the “price increases will be temporary,” and will go back down “when market conditions change.”</p><p>Maingear CEO Wallace Santos <a href="https://wccftech.com/dont-wait-on-pc-upgrades-as-maingear-ceo-warns-memory-shortages-will-deepen/">tells <em>Wccftech</em></a> that customers might want to start “shopping now” if they need a memory or storage upgrade. Though this may seem like another way to boost sales for Black Friday, Santos appears to be genuinely warning of an increased shortage, and says the PCs he’s selling this Black Friday have been “sheltered from these price increases.”</p><p>Skytech Gaming, another company that specializes in prebuilt and custom PCs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/officialskytechgaming">said in a post on Facebook</a> that it’s “getting hit with RAM price increases too,” though it’s unclear whether these changes are impacting the prices listed on its website yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831032/cyberpowerpc-maingear-ram-price-increases-pc-gaming]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>… in space! That is what Young Suns, the latest game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goodbye-volcano-high">Goodbye Volcano High</a>, Depanneur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturne">Nocturne</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gnog">GNOG</a> developer KO_OP Mode, appears to be when put reductively. But let's not put it reductively, because while this is one of those cozy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">life-sims</a>, it does sound like it has something going on for it, particularly for the more revolutionary of you out there.
</p>
<p>
Young Suns is set right after a revolution has taken place on Jupiter, obviously far off in the future because I don't even know if you can actually stand on the orb famously known as the gas giant. Anyway, post-revolution, there is work to be done in order to make it a better place. So, you get given a ship, tasked with heading out to other planetoids, ruins, and stations, either by yourself or with up to three friends.

<p>
The Animal Crossingness of it all manifests in the ability to customize how your character, spaceship, and living quarters looks, with a lot of the UI and UX reminding me of the most recent entry, New Horizons, in particular. There's a very neat-looking character creator too, with options for things like prosthetic limbs and even being fat - as a bigger person myself, it's one of those forgotten aspects that I greatly appreciate, so kudos for highlighting it with a dedicated tummy slider section in the trailer. 
</p><p>
However, while Animal Crossing has its own cast of characters with stories happening in the background, narrative is brought to the foreground in Young Suns. There's a whole bunch of characters to interact with, 30 of 'em apparently, each with "unique looks, behaviors and over 2 months of unique daily chats."
</p>
<p>
The thing that I personally need Young Suns to deliver on is its understanding of the inherent flaws in the genre. Animal Crossing started out as a simple little game where you lived in a town where your neighbours kind of hate you (but in a funny way), and now it has morphed into a game where you must mine the resources of every single resource you come across in order to build and shape the land as you see fit.
</p>
<p>
It's a bit yucky, and I did notice in the trailer that there is some resource mining to be found in Young Suns too. What is a revolution good for if we uphold the systems that oppressed us? Guess I'll find out how KO_OP handle things whenever the game launches on Steam - you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4149610/Young_Suns/">here</a> in the meantime.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-sales-witcher-4-cdpr-2000647747</link>
            <guid>1365976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is keeping the lights on CD Projekt Red. The Polish studio confirmed the 2020 RPG is now its main source of revenue as the rags-to-riches blockbuster reaches 35 million sales before <em>The Witcher 3</em> did.</p> <p>CDPR revealed the new milestone in its latest earnings report. “That’s a better result than<em> The Witcher 3</em> was able to achieve in the same post-release time frame,” CFO Piotr Nielubowicz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ENiOGmcic">said</a>. That make it now the company’s “main source of income” as it staffs up on<a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-online-multiplayer-witcher-4-sequel-cdpr-2000627198"><em> Cyberpunk 2</em></a>, whose development is split between teams in Warsaw and Boston.</p> <p>While about half of the company remains focused on shipping <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR plans to have over 300 developers working on the sci-fi sequel by the end of 2027, suggesting that year will mark an inflexion point as the studio pivots to the full production on the latter. At least if everything goes according to plan.</p>

 <p>While Cyberpunk is still almost half short of The Witcher 3’s 60 million all-time sales, its new record is impressive for a game whose launch was one of the most high-profile disasters in recent gaming history. Despite praise for the PC version, the console port, especially on last-gen consoles, led to viral bug montages, fan revolts, and investor freakouts.</p>

 <p>It’s not every day a game that was once pulled off of PSN by Sony becomes a company’s main cash cow. Much of that turnaround is owed to a series of massive patches and 2023’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion</a>.</p> <p>It’s no doubt also helped by a great Switch 2 port that arrived back in June. The five-year-old game runs great on Nintendo’s new hardware and gives millions of new players a chance to experience V’s tour through heaven and hell in Night City for them selves. Or anyone who played it years ago but still needs to go back and get the good ending. Thanks god for cross-save!</p>

The plumber has had some of his best adventures ever across the two systems, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday</a>, you can save on select Mario games for a limited time. Nintendo rarely puts its games on sale, so now is the time to pick these Mario games up before deals run out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Black Friday Nintendo deals</a> have been very popular so far and have mostly sold out at Amazon. We've included the other retailers that still have the games in stock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Mario Switch Game on Sale for Black Friday 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, it's hard to beat <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a> for only $29.99. Mario's quest to stop Bowser from forcibly marrying Princess Peach sees him traversing various Kingdoms with a new friend named Cappy, a sentient hat creature and this game's central gimmick. Mario can throw Cappy to possess and take control of enemies, inanimate objects, and more. If there's one game from this list I cannot recommend enough, it's Super Mario Odyssey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fantastic Nintendo Switch game on sale is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/28/luigis-mansion-3-review">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>, starring Mario's ghost-hunting brother. This time, Luigi enters a giant hotel with Mario, Toad, and Princess Peach for vacation, but as always, things go horribly wrong. One of the great new features involves solving puzzles using a cloned Luigi, named Gooigi, who can walk on spikes and squeeze through bars to get to places Luigi otherwise can't reach. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-black-friday-deal-2025">Paper-Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> was one of the best Switch games of 2024, and this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-video-games-best-early-deals">Black Friday</a>, you can save 50% on the beloved remake. Originally released for GameCube, The Thousand-Year Door brings a fantastic story, great characters, and a satisfying turn-based RPG combat system. The Nintendo Switch remake added numerous quality-of-life features, like the Partner Ring to switch Partners on the fly, a fast travel system to cut down on backtracking, and more. And that's not to mention the overhauled graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> is on sale for $39.99 for Black Friday. Princess Peach must defend the stage in multiple plays against threats from a new group of enemies in this action-packed adventure. Each play brings a different outfit and ability set for Peach, opening up a completely new gameplay style. This is unlike any other Mario adventure, so if this one went under your radar last year, it's a great time and a worthy addition to your Nintendo Switch library.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Great Nintendo Switch Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren't any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-best-black-friday-deals-2025">Nintendo Switch 2 console deals available</a>, you can still get the bundles before Christmas if you buy now.

They excitedly heralded its entry into what we all know to be the long-dead "console war." The media <a href="https://www.polygon.com/microsoft-xbox-steam-machine-analysis/" rel="nofollow ">chimed in too</a>, opining about the timeliness of its return and whether or not it has the chance to significantly dent the crowded market it's entering into.</p><p dir="ltr">But I don't think the Steam Machine really needs to "fight" in the traditional sense to be competitive. That's because I don't believe it actually has to do anything in order to chip away at the already-crumbling console infrastructure to win hearts and minds. It just has to be there.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Steam Hardware Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The console market is arguably in the best place it's ever going to be for a large shakeup. Nintendo is, as always, doing its own thing with the Switch 2, which has proven itself to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weve-never-seen-anything-like-switch-2s-sales-before/1100-6536384/">phenomenon beyond </a>what we've seen before, and capable of filling the first Switch's intimidatingly large shoes and serving Nintendo's large niche.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the PlayStation 5 has emerged victorious over the Xbox Series X|S, though I'd argue it has failed to leverage that momentum and made itself gaming's premiere hub in large part due to strategic shifts that have complicated matters and muddied the waters. Notably, PlayStation's gambit to invest in live-service titles this console generation hasn't panned out and brought in players outside of its existing ecosystem all that much. At the end of the day, the most exciting prospects in games aren't emerging from PlayStation's camp.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite its missteps, PlayStation has dwarfed Xbox in terms of sales. That reality feels like it has more to do with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-an-increasingly-unstable-platform-for-anyone-to-invest-in/1100-6533717/">Microsoft's instability</a> and lack of concrete direction for its gaming division than PlayStation's own merits and successes.</p><p dir="ltr">In the case of PlayStation and Xbox, both have also increasingly ceded territory to PC gaming in the past several years. While it's a little slow to the process, Sony has ported most of its output this console generation over to PC storefronts. Since the very beginning of the generation, Xbox has been loud about its courtship of PC players, simultaneously launching marquee titles on both Xbox and PC in order to have a more pronounced position in the realm of PC gaming. Lately, the "This is an Xbox" campaign out of Microsoft has emphasized how little sense it makes to pick up one of its consoles over a PC or a Fire Stick, which isn't exactly a great selling point for Xbox consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">As you're hopefully beginning to see, the console space is remarkably weak right now--that's without accounting for the state of U.S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/">tariffs</a>, which are likely to impact Steam Machine pricing but won't surprise its adopters like it did when existing console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">increased</a> console prices in response. In an ecosystem largely driven by exclusivity, PC is also quietly the king, which seems like a major boon in the Steam Machine's favor. With the Steam Machine positioned as its console-like companion and access to much of PC gaming's sizable library, I think the console market has something to be fearful of here.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because a number of this year's biggest success stories are still exclusive to PC. Last we heard, Landfall Games and Aggro Crab's Peak, a multiplayer game about climbing a mountain in often comic situations, had sold north of 10 million copies by August of 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/repo/">REPO</a>, a survival horror game with proximity chat, launched into early access this past February and still maintains concurrents in the six-digits. And though its numbers have since dwindled, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/">Schedule I</a> became the game du jour for a hot second on PC, reaching an all-time peak of nearly 460,000 concurrent players. Outside of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> and continued successes like Fortnite and Roblox, the trend of games achieving viral-levels of success and explosive growth in 2025 has been concentrated on PC exclusives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612753" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612753"></a><figcaption>A look at climbing game Peak.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4612753-4519124-peak_keyart_no_logo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine now promises to bring these titles to console players right out of the box. This audience is occasionally starved for the kinds of tentpole games that justify a console purchase--consider how long it now takes a AAA developer like Naughty Dog to make just one title. The Steam Machine holds a tantalizing potential previously unavailable to console players: the ability to play more of the biggest success stories in gaming that happen each and every year.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the Steam Machine's other uses. While it's certainly a gaming PC disguised as a console first and foremost, it's also, as Valve has clarified, literally a PC too. SteamOS, which has been fine tuned for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a>, has proven its reliability, but Valve has made no secret of the Machine's malleability either. Though I'm sure Valve would love for adopters of the Steam Machine to stick with SteamOS, it isn't locked into one operating system like a console would be. In fact, Valve happily touts the fact that the Steam Machine can support other operating systems and functions if the user wants on the system's own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" rel="nofollow ">landing page</a>!</p><p dir="ltr">At a time where customers are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/aaa-games-like-the-usd70-ghost-of-yotei-are-really-just-for-more-affluent-people-says-analyst-as-soaring-prices-push-players-toward-free-games-and-fortnite-people-just-dont-realize-because-theyre-not-paying-attention/" rel="nofollow ">becoming cagier</a> about where they spend their hard-earned money, a system--one which can double as a home computer and console, too--tapped into Steam's vast library sounds like a much better use of time, energy, and cash than investing in several different consoles. To Valve's benefit, the math is indubitably on its side the second the Steam Machine hits the market.</p><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine may prove popular via another avenue: price. A gaming PC is a luxury expense. It's always been expensive, at times prohibitively so, and that's not changed for the better in the last decade. And while Valve doesn't seem likely to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-price-valve-may-have-just-given-the-best-clue-yet/1100-6536462/">subsidize the Steam Machine</a>, it could prove to be unmistakably game-changing for console players currently spreading their money across multiple consoles, handhelds, a computer, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't love ponying up the grand it took to build my gaming PC, but it turns out that consolidating all the use cases I could have for such a piece of hardware--gaming, working, socializing, browsing and consuming media--and paying a premium for it saved me needing to own anything else. Now, I'm completely alienated from most of my gaming systems. Of them all, my Switch 2 gets the most regular play. Otherwise, my PS5 is a glorified cable box. And my Xbox? Well, I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I booted up my dust-covered Xbox Series X, which is baffling considering it is where I've spent the most time and money since 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">My PC is my new base of operations, and despite its relatively exorbitant cost, it's been worth the price of admission. I suspect many are looking ahead to the next generation of consoles, doing the math, and coming to the same conclusion: buying one Steam console that can play PC, PlayStation, and Xbox games is likely a more sound investment than buying up every alternative on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Just earlier this month, Strauss Zelnick, head of Take-Two Interactive, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" rel="nofollow ">told CNBC</a> that he thought the industry was trending in the direction of PCs rather than consoles. After a decade of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-has-sold-an-absolutely-absurd-amount-of-copies-in-the-last-three-months/1100-6531582/">continued post-launch support and growth--</a>including sustained popularity on PC thanks in part to mods that have turned Grand Theft Auto 5 into a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/gta-online-roleplay-has-kept-game-alive-until-gta-vi-1235326435/" rel="nofollow ">roleplaying simulation</a> among other things--I'm inclined to agree. For better and for worse, gaming's future does in fact appear to lie in, maybe even rely upon, a major shift to PC over consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is well-positioned to capitalize on that shift and further gaming's increasing dependency upon Valve--a prospect fraught with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">its own perils</a>--without breaking a sweat. I don't believe the Steam Machine will immediately light up the charts or have PlayStation shaking in its boots upon launch, but it shouldn't be taken lightly either. No, I suspect it'll be much more of a silent killer, and if any one company has the ability to play the long game here and slowly but surely make a sizable dent in the console market, it's Valve.</p>

    <article>
      <p>In September 2025 Splash Damage, who have been either making or helping make some of the best shooters of the last 20 years,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>was bought by a private equity firm</u></a>. That was just <em>two months ago</em>. Today, the company announced that layoffs are coming.</p><p>In a statement published on social media, Splash Damage's statement reads:</p><blockquote>Today we announced to our teams that we are entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles. This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">This "consultation process" is part of British law</a>, and basically means that layoffs are coming; while we don't know exactly how many, the words "studio-wide" and "affecting all roles" certainly suggests there are going to be more than a few workers impacted.</p><p>Having assisted Microsoft on a number of high-profile shooters through the 2010s, from <em>Gears of War</em> to <em>Halo's Master Chief Collection</em>, Splash Damage was bought by Tencent in 2020. A major project they'd been working on for a number of years, <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, was cancelled at the beginning of 2025, resulting in a wave of layoffs. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xt3s-UE7mDs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Transformers Reactivate - World Premiere Trailer | The Game Awards 2022"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>Transformers Reactivate was first shown off at The Game Awards in 2022, before being officially cancelled in January 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The studio's new owners--who have only been named as "private equity investors"--clearly have no interest in Splash Damage's history or experience, and have instead wasted absolutely no time doing what they do best: buying storied old companies and gutting them to the bone, before throwing those bones into the trash and moving onto the next victim. </p><p>I'm sure some asshole in an expensive suit would argue that as of November 2025 Splash Damage's recent track record and the current volatility affecting the video game market make them a prime target for layoffs and maybe even closure. I would argue that anyone looking at a spreadsheet featuring the last three month's financials, and not the wider picture that this is a studio full of experienced developers who know how to make good video games, should be thrown into the deepest part of the ocean. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t worry, guys, that viral video featuring a fake <em>GTA 6</em> leak that was swiftly identified as AI was all a social experiment! Doesn’t that automatically make the continued, extreme blurring between reality and AI-generated junk a bit better, because in this case, it was done to prove a point? No? Dang.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-leak-fake-ai-youtube-google-2000647395">Yesterday, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s Ethan Gach opined on</a> how the demand for news about Rockstar’s long-awaited, repeatedly delayed game, coupled with the increasing ease with which your neighbor Bob can “create” pictures and videos with generative AI tools like ChatGPT, has made for a fake footage nightmare.</p>

 <p>On November 25, a verified Twitter/X account named <a href="https://x.com/zapactugta6/">ZapActu GTA6</a> issued an “EXTREMELY SERIOUS SITUATION” alert on the platform and shared allegedly leaked footage that appeared to show <em>GTA 6</em> protagonist Lucia walking around in the upcoming game’s open world. The video, reportedly first shared on TikTok, showed off a “dynamic weather system unlike anything seen in&nbsp;<em>GTA V”&nbsp;</em>and “shockingly lifelike NPCs” and a “level of realism” that was quite frankly astounding because it was all fake.

 <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-backlash-creator-of-viral-gta-6-gameplay-leak-video-insists-it-was-an-experiment-designed-to-show-how-easy-it-has-become-to-blur-the-line-between-reality-and-ai-generated-content"><em>IGN</em> reports</a> that Zap Actu GTA6’s Discord was buzzing with backlash after the fake footage leak, prompting them to issue a statement. They claimed the AI-generated <em>GTA 6</em> videos were created “to observe people’s reactions and to demonstrate how easy it has become in 2025 to blur the line between reality and AI-generated content.” They also said there were no “bad intentions” when they created and shared the fake videos.</p>

 <blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">My intention was never to harm anyone. I simply wanted to create something intriguing that could bring people together and spark discussion within the GTA 6 community. I genuinely never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach.</p> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In a much less apologetic message to <em>IGN</em>, Zap Actu said,&nbsp;“It was a huge joke actually, I did it just to entertain the community. Sorry for the false hope lol.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The “I was doing the bad thing to shine light on the bad thing” excuse is one human beings have been using for years (and the same one I used when my parents found a box of candy wrappers under my bed a week before Halloween 1999). It’s hard to believe someone who has dedicated a huge chunk of their internet presence to monitoring <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> news would have “never expected a single video to generate such massive engagement and reach,” especially considering the lack of concrete&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>news over the last decade.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">Though Zap Actu claims they made no money from sharing the fake&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em> leaks, they do have an active “X Premium” account. Those who subscribe to the X Premium get a blue check next to their name and are eligible for monetization if they have at least 500 verified followers (Zap Actu has over 4,000, though it’s unclear how many are verified), have at least 5 million organic impressions in the last three months, and are in a supported country (Zap Actu’s account states it’s based in France).</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, as more and more AI content gets heaped onto the mostly unregulated slop pile that is Twitter, we should expect to encounter more fake <em>GTA 6</em> content that can easily pass as real. What a reality we live in!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Has Explained Why Scrappy The Rooster Exists in ARC Raiders]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scrappy-embark-arc-raiders-back-story/</link>
            <guid>1365919</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone who has played ARC Raiders knows that Scrappy the Rooster exists. He’s a quirky little bird that struts around your Raider Den, collecting all kinds of resources while you’re off topside fighting the ARC – and other Raiders. But nobody really knows how he got there and what his purpose in life is, besides gathering scrap items.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has just set the story straight on where Scrappy came from and why he exists in ARC Raiders.</p>







<h2 id="h-scrappy-has-an-origin-story">Scrappy Has an Origin Story</h2>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-story-of-scrappy-the-rooster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders website</a>, Johan, a 3D artist working on the game, revealed the origin story behind Scrappy, everyone’s favorite and lovable rooster character:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was living with my parents at the time – they happened to keep chickens. Mid-zoom meeting, the birds somehow snuck into the house and strutted around behind me, instantly stealing the show and derailing the meeting entirely. Among those birds was Hȧkan, the rooster that would go on to become Scrappy.</p>



<p><strong>Hȧkan was unlike the other roosters.</strong>&nbsp;Friendly, cuddly, and blind in one eye, he had a habit of stepping in his food and tripping over himself. I adored him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, I decided to photoscan Håkan and sneak him into the game as a silly little easter egg. In early builds, you could sometimes spot a rough version of Hȧkan sprinting around the cantina.</p>



<p><strong>But then, Hȧkan</strong>&nbsp;<strong>got his chance to shine.&nbsp;</strong>The team needed an in-game asset that would be used as a “resource producer,” something that would provide you with materials after each raid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cycled through many ideas: robots, cats… robot-cats! But the art team didn’t have time to build them and the meeting stalled, until someone raised their hand and said, in a moment of brilliance, “don’t we have a rooster?”</p>



<p><strong>That spark of inspiration turned into a phenomenon.&nbsp;</strong>Scrappy went from hidden easter egg, to “temporary mesh we’ll definitely replace later”, to a beloved and irreplaceable part of the ARC Raiders universe. So next time you see Scrappy, tell him I say hello!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a quaint story, but it perfectly explains why Scrappy exists in a world so devoid of animal life. Most of the humour has been sucked clean out of the world on account of it being a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but knowing that Scrappy is waiting for you when you return to Speranza is always a nice touch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since Fortnite launched in 2017, it has had some downright insane collaborations. The latest one is due to arrive this coming Sunday, November 30, 2025, with the previously unreleased Kill Bill chapter, Yuki's Revenge, coming to Fortnite as part of the Quentin Tarantino collaboration.</p>



<p>Epic Games put out a new teaser trailer for the collaboration today, giving us our first look at the chapter that never made it to the silver screen, but will now see the light of day more than 20 years after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 2.</p>



<p>Fortnite has been a part of several 'firsts' for video games, and this has to be a new one, as it's currently difficult to recall another time when a previously unreleased chapter of a popular film was showcased for the first time as part of a popular video game, instead of, say, a movie theatre.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Lost Chapter: Yuki’s Revenge | Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7h1aMVdBEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, the short will be shown in theatres, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/yukis-revenge-premieres-in-fortnite-on-november-30?lang=en-US">according to a blog post on the Fortnite website</a>. "<em>Starting December 5, participating theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom will show Yuki’s Revenge as part of an exclusive limited theatrical run of </em><em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em>," the blog post reads.</p>



<p>US players who purchase a ticket to go see the short in theatres between November 20 and November 29 will also receive a code for the in-game Gogo Yubari outfit at participating theatres. </p>



<p>This weekend in Fortnite also marks the end of Chapter Six and the beginning of Chapter Seven, with Zero Hour kicking off this coming Saturday, November 29, 2025.</p>

            <p>
It is not exactly a secret that, in recent years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> hasn't been doing so hot. Frequenters of the pseudo-MMO have found certain expansions and updates to be disappointing, and for a live service game a few too many disappointments can be devastating. Now, in a new interview, the game's director Tyson Green has acknowledged how the game is struggling to bring in a new audience, and discussed the difficulties that come with that.
</p>
<p>
"For years now, Destiny has been on this steady hardening of the core [audience]," Green said, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>. "More and more core players are staying and playing the game, but relatively few [new] people come into the game. There's a tightening and contraction, and this presents problems for a game that you're trying to maintain as a live service, especially when you want to keep serving those core players with great, compelling expansions."
</p>
<p>
Part of the issue, Green thinks, is that Destiny 2's expansion The Final Shape, which essentially wrapped up the main story Bungie had been working on nigh on a decade. They found that those that played it felt satisfied, but "the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?"
</p>
<p>
Of course, as Green notes, from a business perspective this isn't what they had planned, and he noted that they wanted to and want to keep working within the world of Destiny. "There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something."
</p><p>
That something is the game's new Fate saga, the latest addition of that being the Star Wars themed Renegades. I'm not a Destiny person myself, and I can tell you personally that has someone who has floated the idea of picking the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> up, Star Wars does nothing for me (I think brand crossovers are the devil's work, particularly in narrative-driven live service games), and just how much of the story is vaulted away makes it feel not particularly worth it either.
</p><p>

Perhaps slightly soberingly, Green also said that he thinks Bungie have "been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny."

</p><p>
There are whispers from a source whose reputability I can't quite determine, so take this with the tiniest pinches of salt, <a href="https://x.com/Deakstiny/status/1993498863764672752">that Destiny 3 is in the works</a>, but I am wondering if this isn't the trump card Bungie may want it to be. And with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">Marathon as it is</a>, well, Bungie can't really afford to make any mistakes.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/</link>
            <guid>1365898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re just weeks out from the start of the Call of Duty League 2026 season, and teams are starting to be unveiled. The organizations across the board are lifting the lid on jerseys, rosters, and operating models, as the Call of Duty esports world prepares for what could be one of the most ambitious seasons in CDL history.</p>



<p>Next season, the Call of Duty League comes back to the United Kingdom for the first time in <strong>many years</strong>, teams have been shaken up more than <strong>ever</strong>, and the Call of Duty League Championship is headed back to <strong>Las Vegas</strong>.</p>



<p>Gentlemates is the latest team to uncover its four-man roster heading into the new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-your-gentlemates-have-been-confirmed">Your Gentlemates Have Been Confirmed</h2>



<p>Gentlemates, which assumed control of the Los Angeles Guerrillas spot last season, has confirmed the four-man starting lineup ahead of the commencement of the 2026 CDL season:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon</li>



<li>Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</li>



<li>Daunte ‘Sib’ Gray</li>



<li>Travis ‘Neptune’ McCloud</li>
</ul>



<p>It was a mixed season last year for these players, but perhaps none more so than Neptune, a superstar player who broke back into the CDL under the Vancouver Surge banner, going on to land in second place at multiple Major tournaments <strong>and </strong>at COD Champs. It was <strong>almost </strong>Neptune’s greatest season ever.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ghosty and Envoy migrate from LA Thieves, their spots overtaken by a restructuring that has finally pulled aBeZy out from under the FaZe banner.</p>



<p>LAT won Major 3 and Major 4 and went on to top the chart by the end of the season, but a hugely lacklustre performance in Kitchener at COD Champs saw the team drop out in seventh place after being defeated by Boston Breach <strong>and </strong>Vancouver Surge. There’s likely very little love lost between Envoy, Ghosty, and Neptune.</p>



<p>Sib comes over from Cloud9 NY, a rehash of the old New York Subliners roster that was also taken over last season. It was a horrible year for C9NY, with the team failing to secure a spot of traction the whole season through, falling extremely short and not even making it to Champs.</p>



<p>Ironically, C9NY <strong>still </strong>finished above LAG M8 in the season standings.</p>



<p>It’s going to be a busy year in the Call of Duty League. Let me know what roster you’re most interested in on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-mtg-magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-superdrop-2000647703</link>
            <guid>1365883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em>‘s Secret Lair x <em>Monster Hunter</em> drop was revealed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251121083502/https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-monster-hunter-superdrop">just last week</a>. It featured a number of characters and creatures from the hit Capcom multiplayer series and a Sol Ring promo card in each drop. But fans were not impressed. The card selection for the reprints was criticized for being uninspired and having nothing to do with the series it was drawing from. In fact, the fan reaction was so loud <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">that Wizards of the Coast</a> has done something completely unexpected: take the Secret Lair drop back to the drawing board.</p> <p>“We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better,” the company <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/back-to-the-drawing-board-with-secret-lair-x-monster-hunter">announced on Wednesday</a>. “We’re going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.” Wizards admitted it “missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of <em>Monster Hunter</em> and plans to rework the Superdrop in the meantime. Details on the new set won’t be re-revealed until next year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We care a lot about the worlds we get to celebrate, and Secret Lair x Monster Hunter didn’t quite come together the way it should have. We hear you, so we’re heading back to the drawing board to rework this Superdrop. More to come.<a href="https://t.co/dtHublSB13">https://t.co/dtHublSB13</a> <a href="https://t.co/yMkaUPaUWI">pic.twitter.com/yMkaUPaUWI</a></p> <p>— MTG Secret Lair (@MTGSecretLair) <a href="https://twitter.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1993726445193990451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Players had three main complaints about the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter collaboration. The first was that the card selection was pretty bland and not aligned with the series’ lore. Valstrax, the silver Elder Dragon, was <a href="https://x.com/TheTrinketMage/status/1990867324048421298">a Sol Ring</a>&nbsp;despite being neither an artifact nor a ring. Some took issue with the color selection for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1p0lerg/official_magic_the_gathering_x_monster_hunter/">various references</a>, as well as the card art.</p>

 <p>The general bewilderment was best encapsulated by the Champion of Kotoko card, which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mtg/comments/1p0i9dq/monster_hunter_secret_lair_champion_of_kotoko/">misspelled Kokoto</a>, the village from the very first Monster Hunter game. It didn’t help that many of the reprinted cards had a second-hand market value well below the $30 and $40 Superdrops.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Upon further inspection some of the Monster Hunter x Magic The Gathering cards don't look too good</p> <p>Velkhana and Malzeno especially look a bit weird, like they had their face smoothed.</p> <p>Yuan Garuga also looks goofy and then there's Champion Of "Kotoko" <a href="https://t.co/bbyOFVHpUG">pic.twitter.com/bbyOFVHpUG</a></p> <p>— DarkHero (@DarkHeroCC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkHeroCC/status/1991154721541722419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>One MTG YouTuber summed up the response with a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NASy37-CGaE">The <em>Monster Hunter</em> Secret Lair Sucks</a>.”</p> <p>Now that Wizards is redoing the set from scratch, some fans are hopeful it might just go the route of making completely unique cards rather than picking other card reprints to tag with new<em> Monster Hunter</em> names and art. Or Wizards could bring back the “craft” mechanic from<em> Lost Caverns of Ixalan,</em> given <em>MonHon</em>‘s emphasis on creatures and equipment. There have also been requests for Capcom’s own artists to contribute to the illustrations.</p> <p>Whatever the revised Secret Lair Superdrop ends up being, Wizards says not to get used to this sort of reversal. “Pulling Superdrops back isn’t something we’re going to do very often, but we’re committed to doing better,” the company wrote today. “Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Invented a Whole New Genre and Nobody Noticed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/</link>
            <guid>1365880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to stun audiences worldwide, retaining a player base equalling hundreds of thousands of users a month after launch. It has proven to be one of the most energetic, electrifying games of the year, storming up the charts and taking over social and streaming platforms with ease.</p>



<p>What many don’t seem to have noticed is that ARC Raiders didn’t just disrupt an existing genre; it <strong>created a new one</strong>. This stellar title from Embark Studios has been dubbed an extraction shooter by <strong>all comers</strong>, but it’s not… It’s something else entirely.</p>











<p>ARC Raiders is <strong>not </strong>an extraction shooter, but an extraction <strong>adventure</strong>. This naming convention hasn’t been used before, and every other game in the space that walks a close line to ARC Raiders typically refers to itself as a simple ‘extraction shooter’.</p>



<p>With ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has gone <strong>beyond </strong>the fundamental term and created a category that better describes the nature of this game. It’s a broader, bolder, and more sizeable extraction title than we’ve ever seen, packed with lore and an intriguing backstory that’s being explored over the next few years, all being well.</p>



<p>This is what I mean by the naming conventions, taking what other developers and publishers in the space refer to their game as on storefronts and in marketing materials:</p>



<ul>
<li>Escape from Tarkov – ‘Extraction FPS’</li>



<li>Arena Breakout: Infinite – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Incursion: Red River – ‘First-Person Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Zero Sievert – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>Gray Zone Warfare – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>



<li>PUBG: Black Budget – ‘Extraction Shooter’</li>
</ul>



<p>And then <a href="https://arcraiders.com/#purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s ARC Raiders</a>… <strong>Extraction Adventure</strong>.</p>



<p>The game’s blurb relays this sentiment perfectly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ARC Raiders blends the tension from extraction shooters with atmospheric settings from the adventure genre. Lurking threats—from deadly machines to other Raiders—create a constant ebb and flow of intensity, where every moment is charged with the thrill of high stakes. Extract valuable loot and explore the unfolding mysteries of a vibrant, lethal world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been dubbed an ‘immersive world’ that unfolds over multiple biomes, taking players from arid environments to cold, surgical facilities carved deep into mountainsides. The social elements of ARC Raiders make it more unpredictable than anything to emerge in the space in years, and it’s that uncertain edge that makes each raid ‘absolute cinema’.</p>



<p>With some RPG elements woven into the game’s skill paths, a far-reaching story that’s being drip-fed to players over time, and the ability to lead an experience over several iterations of characters, each with different opportunities, ARC Raiders really is in a league of its own.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s right that Embark Studios has dubbed ARC Raiders an ‘extraction adventure’, or would you call it something else? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-new-18-36-player-mode-annihilation-trailer-2000647688</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>has always been a chaotic, competitive game of sensory overload. Developer NetEase is deciding to lean further into that by giving the hero shooter a mode that triples the number of players on screen at once. Happy first anniversary, heroes.</span></p> <p><span>The 18v18 Annihilation mode is exactly what it sounds like. The 36-player mode pits two teams that are three times the size of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-dog-healer-twitch-streamer-2000647271"><span>your usual </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>stack</span></a><span> against one another and crosses its fingers that your PC and console can handle it. I’m thinking of all the technically demanding attacks and effects in this game, and wondering what happens if you have 36 players using them at the same time. Will your PS5 crash if 36 Doctor Strange players open portals up on one map? We’ll find out tomorrow when the mode goes live.</span></p>

  <p><span>Funnily enough, you could have an 18v18 match made up entirely of different heroes with the game’s expansive roster, though the trailer shows some match-ups of multiple of the same character, like a fight of mostly players waddling around as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962"><span>Jeff the Land Shark</span></a><span>. With this many heroes on the field at once, any characters with big, game-changing area-of-effect moves are going to thrive, I will say, seeing Star-Lord auto-aiming with his ultimate as a crowd of helpless enemies’ health bars ticked down did scratch an itch in my brain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Will this be what gets me back into </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>? Probably not. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>and I worked out our differences</span></a><span>, and I’ve got a battle pass to complete. I doubt this mode is going to become the go-to competitive play style for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>players, but it will probably give them something fun to do for a few weeks before everyone inevitably goes back to playing the standard 6v6 format. I look forward to seeing the crazy clips of shenanigans players pull off.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>just entered its fifth season, which added Gambit to the roster. Rogue will join the fray during the mid-season update next month.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[World of Warcraft: Midnight Is Officially Launching on March 2, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/</link>
            <guid>1365844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard Entertainment has just confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, the eleventh expansion pack for the most popular subscription-based MMORPG, will be released on Monday, March 2, 2026 at 3:00 PM Pacific Time.</p>



<p>An earlier rumor from leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> a February 26, 2026 date. It appears that Blizzard has finally settled on taking a few more days, though it really is a nearly insignificant delay compared to the date listed in that report.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight is the middle chapter of the trilogy known as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>. This narrative was conceived by returning writer Chris Metzen, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/chris-metzen-blizzard-retires/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left Blizzard in 2016</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-christ-metzen-returning-lead-franchise-wow-next-generation-of-adventures/">returned in 2023</a>. Following the events of the previous expansion, The War Within, Xal’atath, the so-called Harbinger of the Void, returns to Azeroth and unleashes utter chaos in her wake. The ensuing invasion strikes at the heart of the Blood Elf homelands in Eversong Woods. Meanwhile, the looming Voidstorm threatens to extinguish all light and cover the world in darkness as it arrives over the ancient elven kingdom of Quel'thalas.</p>



<p>As mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my previous Deep Dive article</a>, the expansion introduces player housing through the so-called Neighborhoods, the new opt-in Prey bounty hunting system, the new Haranir Allied Race, the new Devourer specialization for the Demon Hunter class, four explorable zones (the Eversong Woods, which have been merged with the Ghostlands; Zul'Aman; Harandar; and the Voidstorm), eleven Delves, eight Dungeons, three Raids, new PvP content (a new Battleground and the Training Grounds as a permanent mode), a reimagined Silvermoon City that now hosts the Horde and Alliance both, and other improvements to User Interface and transmogrification. In the campaign storyline, players will have the option to choose which of multiple paths to complete first.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Midnight Arrives 3.2.26 | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oK_-6glk2MM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While you'll have to wait for early March to play most of the content in World of Warcraft: Midnight, player housing is actually being made available in early access starting next Tuesday, on December 2, for those players who pre-purchased the expansion. To celebrate the arrival of this long-requested feature, Blizzard crafted a range of special rewards across all its games for players who move into their first home and earn the new 'Welcome Home' achievement in World of Warcraft.</p>



<p>Overwatch 2 players can look forward to the following in-game unlocks:</p>



<ul>
<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Legendary Skin</li>



<li>Xal’atath Symmetra Spray</li>



<li>Xal'atath Symmetra Name Card</li>



<li>Dark Heart Player Icon</li>
</ul>



<p>Hearthstone players will unlock the Hearth &amp; Home Card Back. Furthermore, separate from the WoW achievement, the collectible card game now hosts a new, limited-time in-game event, 'Welcome to the Neighborhood!', featuring an earnable Epic event card.</p>



<p>Lastly, in StarCraft II, players will be able to show their allegiance in every match with the new Horde and Alliance StarCraft II skins. Weirdly, there won't be any Diablo IV tie-in unlocks.</p>

Look, ok, I get it Square Enix. I understand why you put 2B in absolutely everything. She is a character with particular qualities that certain audiences found very appealing! But I am begging you… stop putting her in things. I'm sick to death of seeing her everywhere, her blindfolded eyes somehow still staring directly into my soul, begging me to spend money on endless gacha rolls, but this time in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a>, the next game she's set to appear in.
</p>
<p>
It's even easier to understand why she's in this one, it's another Square Enix game after all, they don't even have to do any annoying brand deals. On this particular occasion, rather than as a playable character (presumably because her fighting Sephiroth was too much for even Square Enix), 2B will be a boss fight you can take on. Which means that really, the main draw will be the outfits for a few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> characters.

<p>
The two graced and/or cursed depending on how you look at it with such outfits are everyone's favourite ninja Yuffie, puppy-boy Cloud, and the more predictable choice out of the two, Tifa. I fear for what this might do to Clerith shippers that think this is a sign that Square Enix has a preference, but I digress.
</p><p>
More than anything, I would just like Square Enix to let Yoko Taro either make or, if they are working on one, announce a new… anything, honestly, but a fresh entry into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>'s world would be nice. The poor moon-shaped head lad can't seem to catch a break at the moment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-creator-yoko-taro-would-like-you-to-know-he-has-been-working-on-games-they-just-keep-getting-cancelled">what with him saying games he's been working on keep getting cancelled</a>. We're quickly approaching Automata's 10th anniversary! Let the endearing oddball get on with it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime English studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-canceled-splash-damage-layoffs-1851735308">Splash Damage</a> is facing an uncertain future as it begins a consultation process that will affect all staff and likely lead to layoffs.</p> <p>On November 26, Splash Damage publicly announced online that the studio was entering a “studio-wide consultation process” that would involve all employees across all roles and disciplines. This follows the London-based studio being acquired in September by a private equity investor after being sold by its previous owner, Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>“This was a difficult step for us to take,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">Splash Damage via a message shared on LinkedIn</a>. “But we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We’re committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.”</p>

 <p>Splash Damage already suffered layoffs earlier this year after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122"><em>Transformers</em> game it was working on was canceled</a>. The last game the studio shipped was 2020’s <em>Outcasters</em> for Google’s now-defunct Stadia game streaming service. Before that, the studio, which was formed in 2001, had developed various popular multiplayer games, including <em>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink,</em> and helped Xbox as a support studio on <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> titles. It also developed <em>Gears of War Tactics.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It is the latest round of bad news for the video game industry as developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs">continue to be laid off and studios closed as publishers tighten their belts</a> and begin<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251"> investing more into AI generation tools</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In first-person shooters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">especially older games or retro-inspired boomer shooters</a>, the first gun you get tells you a lot about the game. And in <em>Mohrta</em>, your first weapon is a powerful, accurate, hard-hitting revolver that makes the<a href="https://youtu.be/jRrommJ5V9w"> famous M1-Garand “ping” noise</a> every time you reload it. This is just one of the many reasons why I adore <em>Mohrta,</em> which is out now on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"><em>Mohrta</em>, which launched last month</a>, is a non-linear first-person shooter built in GZDoom that has big <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> vibes. And yes, I know mentioning<em> Dark Souls</em> in a blog or article about video games risks mockery,&nbsp; but the way this game’s save shrines work and the pacing of each of the worlds you visit, plus its challenging boss fights, create <em>very </em>similar vibes to a FromSoftware RPG. Except you have a shotgun. <a href="https://youtu.be/e_HT14h35eg">Wait, actually, FromSoftware did that, actually</a>. Huh…anyway, I mentioned <em>Morrowind</em> because <em>Mohtra’s</em> strange dark fantasy universe has similar aesthetics to Bethesda’s popular RPG, too. But again, with more guns.</p>

  <p>In <em>Mohrtra</em>, you play as an undead knight-like machine-man who is determined to clean up all the nasty, strange creatures and oddities infesting the land while tracking down someone important. To save the lands and find this person, you’ll need to explore various worlds that ramp up in difficulty, but which can be completed in any order you desire. You start with a powerful sword and badass revolver and grow your arsenal with a shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, an SMG that fires bones, and some other really odd weapons I won’t spoil here. All of the weapons feel great, and because the game is built in GZDoom, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">a modern source port of id’s classic ’90s FPS</a>, gameplay feels snappy, fast, and punchy.</p>

 <p>You also have a small talking doll that can heal you and a vulture on your shoulder that provides light when exploring dark caverns or ruins. <em>Mohtra</em> is weird if you haven’t got that yet. But I love it. Returning from levels to the large market hub world is always a treat. The strange denizens of this world are always willing to chat and trade with you, letting you upgrade your gear and guns, making future missions in new worlds easier.</p>

 <p>All of this is drenched in gorgeous retro-inspired textures and effects. Forests are foggy and gloomy. Lava-filled caves are dark and foreboding. Ancient ruins look deserted and lonely. Immaculate vibes going in this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067">Who needs 4K raytracing when you got the <em>Doom</em> engine?</a></p> <p>If you are craving a five-to-seven-hour oddball boomer shooter that isn’t just about running through corridors and killing soldiers or zombies,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"> I’d hop over to Steam and check out <em>Mohtra</em></a>, one of the best FPS games released this year. And tell me how you think <em>Mohtra</em> is pronounced.&nbsp; I’ve been saying “mow-CH-ru.” But I heard someone say “MAHT-ra.” I don’t know, I’m too busy shooting creepy skeleton men with my bone gun to worry about that kind of stuff.</p>

These are very similar to the WH-1000XM5 in form factor, features, and sound quality. While they aren't quite as powerful as the XM5 model, the XM4 headphones still offer excellent playback quality and noise cancellation.

Positioned between The War Within (2024) and the future expansion The Last Titan, Midnight marks a major return to one of Azeroth's most iconic settings while pushing the overarching saga toward its cosmic climax. Revealed during this past summer and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+gamescom+warcraft&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcased heavily at Gamescom</a>, the expansion signals a dramatic escalation in the war between Light and Void.</p><p>Set in a fully rebuilt and reimagined Quel'Thalas, Midnight centers on a massive Void invasion led by Xal'atath, whose manipulations during The War Within left Azeroth vulnerable to the voidlord Dimensius. The Void now seeks to claim the Sunwell--a source of potent magical energy--and plunge the world into terror. Players will work to reunite the fractured elven tribes, forge alliances with ancient powers, and ultimately join the Light's armies in a desperate effort to repel the Shadow once and for all. Zones such as Eversong, Zul'Aman, Harandar, and the Voidstorm will be heavily featured for the campaign. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_-6glk2MM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oK_-6glk2MM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Midnight introduces several major gameplay features and progression updates, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">including player housing</a>, a long-requested addition to the game. The expansion also debuts a new Allied Race, the Haranir, an ancient, root-dwelling people from the hidden zone of Harandar whose flora-grown architecture evokes the natural magics of early Azeroth. Players will be able to choose their zone progression order after completing Eversong, offering additional flexibility in how the campaign unfolds. Alongside returning lore heavyweights such as Wrathion, Khadgar, and Alexstrasza, the story pushes deeper into the tumult of the Worldsoul Saga.</p><p>Onboarding systems for both new and returning players are being refreshed as well. Beginners will now flow from <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24226733" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Exile's Reach directly into a streamlined "story mode"</a> version of Dragonflight, complete with narrative versions of raid finales, ending at level 70. Returning players can take a guided recap tour through Arathi Highlands with Jaina or Thrall, unlocking gear scaled to their level and covering core gameplay essentials like skyriding and interrupts. There will also be a War Within catch-up--designed to hit the expansion's major story beats in just a few hours--that helps new and returning players progress smoothly from level 70 to 80 as they enter Midnight and continue the Worldsoul Saga.</p>

<p>Splash Damage, the studio behind games like Gears Tactics and Star Wars: Hunters, is facing layoffs that could impact the entire company.</p>



<p>These new layoffs are happening just two months after Splash Damage was sold by former parent company Tencent to an unknown group of private equity investors. </p>







<h2 id="h-splash-damage-layoffs-are-studio-wide">Splash Damage Layoffs Are “Studio-Wide”</h2>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, it was announced that the company was <strong>“entering a studio-wide consultation process affecting all roles.”</strong> This consultation, they say, was a <strong>“difficult step” </strong>for the company, but it’s one that they believe is <strong>“necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market.”</strong></p>



<p>This is the second time this year that Splash Damage has faced layoffs. After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/transformers-reactivate-cancelled-splash-damage-to-lay-off-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate</a>, the studio said that it needed to scale down in order to <strong>“refocus our efforts on other projects.”</strong></p>



<p>Those efforts included Star Wars: Hunters, a game that released on mobile in June 2024. In January 2025, the game released in Early Access on Windows, but was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled just two months</a> later with the game shutting down fully on October 1, 2025.</p>







<p>The company’s statement on Wednesday ended with a promise to “explore every option” in order to retain as many employees as possible, while giving support to those who will be let go.</p>



<p><strong>“We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>Formed in 2001, Splash Damage has worked on a mix of its own games while also co-developing other titles. Games on its resume include Gears of War 4 and 5, Halo: The Master Chief Collection, and Doom 3. Currently, the studio is working on an open-world survival game called “Project Astrid”. That game was announced back in 2023, but no updates have come since. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to ask if the sale had anything to do with the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
