            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208741/super-nintendo-upgrade-voultar-edge-enhancer-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo sold over 49 million Super Nintendo consoles, but not all of them were created equal. A later hardware revision improved the quality of the SNES’s video output, and over three decades later, one modder has come up with a way to bring those same improvements to nearly every Super Nintendo ever released.</p><p>Zach Henson, a console modder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630417/wii-u-system-error-160-0103-bricking-nand-memory">who also goes by the name Voultar</a>, has created a DIY modification kit for older Super Nintendo consoles called the Edge Enhancer. Expected to sell for around $60, the mod kit upgrades the console’s video output, making graphics appear much sharper and colors more saturated.</p><p>Although Nintendo made many revisions to the Super Nintendo’s hardware during the console’s production run, for retro gamers, there are essentially two versions of the SNES that matter. The original, which is now referred to as the SHVC or two-chip model, and an upgraded version that came later, known as the 1CHIP model based on how Nintendo labeled its motherboard.</p><p>The two-chip SNES featured a video digital to analog converter in its picture processing unit (PPU) that gamers have since discovered wasn’t able to quickly transition between different colors. This resulted in video output that tended to look soft or blurred because the graphics appeared to have a halo or shadow around them.</p><p>The problem wasn’t as noticeable in the ’90s when everyone played on CRT TVs, but with a Super Nintendo connected to a modern display, the differences are more prominent.</p><div><figcaption><em>A comparison between the quality of the video output on the two-chip Super Nintendo (left) and one-chip model (right).</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>For the later 1CHIP version of the Super Nintendo, the company merged the original’s two video chips and CPU into a single chip. It was a cost-cutting move to make it cheaper to manufacture the console, but the new components also resulted in video output that was much sharper with noticeably improved colors.</p><p>For retro gamers who prefer to play on original hardware, the 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are now very much sought after and can sell for well over $200. But demand could soon be waning, thanks to this new upgrade kit.</p><p>Installing Voultar’s Edge Enhancer mod isn’t for beginners, as Tito Perez from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40MachoNachoProductions">YouTube’s Macho Nacho Productions</a> recently demonstrated in a video. Not only does the SNES have to be completely dismantled, but there’s quite a bit of soldering required, and you have to remove the original transistors, capacitors, and resistors from the console’s motherboard.</p><div><figcaption><em>Onscreen text looks incredibly crisp on a two-chip Super Nintendo with Voultar’s Edge Enhancer installed.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Macho Nacho Productions</cite></p></div><p>A lot could go wrong when installing the various components needed for the mod. So while <a href="https://voultar.com/">Voultar</a> plans to eventually sell a DIY Edge Enhancer kit once the documentation and tutorials are finalized, it will initially only be available as part of a more expensive installation service that will ensure the upgrades are done correctly.</p><p>Pricing hasn’t been revealed just yet, but given that 1CHIP Super Nintendo consoles are becoming increasingly rare, the Edge Enhancer mod could still be much cheaper, even with the cost of shipping a Super Nintendo’s motherboard off to be upgraded.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Plaion (formerly <a href="https://wccftech.com/koch-media-changes-name-to-plaion-decision-made-independently-from-embracer-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known</a> as Koch Media) and Skydance announced a global publishing deal for the single player action/adventure game Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p>Klemens Kundratitz, CEO of PLAION, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development. This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION’s ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.</em></p>
<p>Julian Break, Co-President at Skydance Games, said:</p>
<p><em>We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra. For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.</em></p>
<p>Haluk Mentes, Head of Marvel Games, added:</p>
<p><em>MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra is an exquisite and bold take on some of our most beloved and timeless characters. The world-class development talent of Skydance Games and global publishing capabilities of PLAION are an excellent team-up to ensure we deliver on the massive promise this game has. We’re excited to collaborate and bring MARVEL 1943 to players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/1943-rise-of-hydra-amy-hennig-2025-unreal-engine-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled </a>in March, at GDC 2024, with a stunning trailer that showed its impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals. Players will control an ensemble of four characters: Steve Rogers (Captain America), Azzuri (Black Panther), Gabriel Jones (a member of the Howling Commandos), and Nanali (a leader of the Wakandan spies).</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is slated to launch at some point next year. Platforms haven't been announced, but PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X are a safe bet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-xbox-360-marketplace-is-officially-closed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Xbox 360 Marketplace is <a href="https://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially closed</a>. It’s shut down. It’s gone for good.</p>



<p>It’s a day we <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/say-goodbye-to-the-xbox-360-store-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knew was coming for a while</a>, but now that it’s finally here, it doesn’t feel real. Gone is nearly 20 years of gaming history for players. Gone is the first online console store that many used as Xbox 360 quickly became <em>the </em>console to have in the mid-2000s. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Almost 19 years on, all good things must come to an end. We are in the final 24 hours (or so) of the Xbox  360 Marketplace. </p><p>It was my pleasure sharing all the thousands of marketplace sales and updates I’ve given over the years. </p><p>Thank for having fun, playing fair and filing…</p></div>— Larry Hryb, Gamer Emeritus 📱⌨️🖱️🎮 (@majornelson) <a href="https://twitter.com/majornelson/status/1817696501558317267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But just because the marketplace is gone, that doesn’t mean playing on the 360 is gone with it.</p>



<p>You’ll no longer be able to buy games, DLC, or other content for the system any more via the store nor will the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app&nbsp;no longer works. However, if you happen to own and play games on the console, you can still play them as you’d like. Online services such as multiplayer will also continue to function. You’ll also be able to download any content previously purchased and installed on your system.</p>



<p>So at least that all still exists. But for how long?</p>



<p>The Xbox 360 launched in November 2005. Almost 20 years for a console that many refuse to admit is retro at this point. It’s only a matter of time before servers for the system are taken offline. Whether it’s a year or five years from now, that day is coming.</p>



<p>It’s pretty sad to think about.</p>



<hr>

                <p>By now you've probably heard that Robert Downey Jr. is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not as Iron Man, but as masked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-returns-to-the-mcu-in-avengers/1100-6525361/" data-ref-id="1100-6525361">villain Doctor Doom</a>. This is not the first time he's been tapped for the role, as he was considered to play the menacing physician before Iron Man even entered pre-production.</p><p>This information was first revealed a little over a year ago, when Marvel Studios released promotional material celebrating the first Iron Man movie's 15th anniversary. In a conversation between director Jon Favreau and producer Kevin Feige, Favreau recalled, "You had all met with him already for like Doctor Doom or something, on another project... so everybody sort of knew who he was." Feige apparently confirmed with a simple "right." Model and actor Julian McMahon played Doctor Doom in the original two Fantastic Four films, both released before Iron Man.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bx4O7Ub1GY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="278">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-bx4O7Ub1GY?start=278" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Robert Downey Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as well as a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer. At San Diego Comic Con, Marvel announced the titles of the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/san-diego-comic-con-2024-biggest-news-announcements-trailers/2900-5626/" data-ref-id="2900-5626">two Avengers movies</a>: Doomsday and Secret Wars. The Russo brothers, who directed two Captain America films, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame, are also returning to direct the next two Avengers films.</p>

		<p>Last month, Nightdive Studios confirmed it was working on The Thing: Remastered, a remake of the 2002 game that was based on the 1982 classic sci-fi horror film. While details are scant on the release date for The Thing: Remastered, Nightdive Studios has released a new developer diary which focuses on the game’s artwork and design, showing some of the differences from the 2002 game.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Is The Art Progressing on The Thing: Remastered? Full Deep Dive Interview with Joel Welsh" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzvs7EXgCxw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Thing: Remastered deep dive on the artwork is conducted by Locke Vincent and he is joined by Joel Welsh, the studio’s art lead, who explains some of the decisions being made. For example, in the screenshots of the The Thing: Remastered we are shown that there is more detail, like tiles on the floor and additional signage compared to the original game. Joel also confirms that some of the development team of the original had been able to supply information for Nightdive Studios to use and work with, allowing for a smoother development process for this remaster. A lot of the assets remain the same, but in a higher resolution. Each change is being done on a case by case basis, with care being made that any changes fit with the scenes of the game and the film.</p>
<p>It has to be said that all of the work shown by Nightdive Studios is still a work in progress, and that there will be further changes to the visual design of the remaster. As said, we do not yet know when The Thing: Remastered will be released though we do know it is expected for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-announced-features-captain-america-and-black-panther/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra&nbsp;</a>was announced back in March by Marvel and Skydance, offering a new story for Marvel in videogames, with the focus being on Captain America and Black Panther during World War II. Today, it has been confirmed that Skydance has partnered with PLAION, which will handle the global distribution rights of Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We are proud to partner with Skydance Games and industry legend Amy Hennig on what is one of the most anticipated AAA games currently in development,”</em> said Klemens Kundratitz, CEO, PLAION.<em> “This partnership between two ambitious independent companies is a testament to PLAION’s ongoing mission to become a global force in videogame publishing.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We believe PLAION is the perfect publishing partner for the multiplatform, worldwide release of&nbsp;MARVEL 1943: Rise of Hydra”</em> said Julian Beak, Co-President at Skydance Games. <em>“For our studio’s debut title, we’re crafting an original Marvel story directed by Amy Hennig. We’re thrilled to have found a global publisher that shares our ambitious vision for the project.”</em></p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters. The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is set to release in 2025, with PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S being the likely platforms.</p>

<p><em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july">announced last month</a>, but we've now got a release date, and it turns out that release date is, well, today. The tool itself is free, but naturally, you're going to need your own Jackbox games if you want to use it.</p>
<p>If you do have Jackbox games in your library, though, you'll be able to sift through them and choose whichever one you want to play without having to load up the relevant game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-game-view.jpg?itok=3OiWHuC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-game-view.jpg?itok=QDk3BsxX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>lets you choose whichever Jackbox game you like.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as a library for your Jackbox games,&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>also acts as a news platform for Jackbox games; Jackbox says it'll put players "in the know about any announcements, sales opportunities, and upcoming releases".</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to organize your library and sort it according to your preferences, so if there are Jackbox games you don't like, you can leave them out of your&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>if you prefer.</p>
<p>If you're lacking Jackbox games, then the studio's got some rather enticing offers for you to take advantage of, including a free game to get your collection started, as well as a sale.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you like your time with&nbsp;<em>Drawful 2&nbsp;</em>and you want to pick up new games - or if you've yet to embark on your Jackbox journey, full stop - then&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Party Pack</em>, the first game in the series, is available at a 90% discount for a month starting from today.</p>
<p>Various other sales will also be available on&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>games, so make sure to keep an eye on the Steam pages for the games so you don't miss out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-motorways-devs-canceled-magic-school-game-looks-enchanting.939660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-dev-canceled-magic-school<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club has released details about a canceled project called&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, calling the release of the information a chance to "celebrate what we learned along the way and the incredible work from our team".</p>
<p>In a press release, Dinosaur Polo Club says that telling its fans about&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>could serve as a chance to "transparently discuss learnings" from the project, which hasn't resulted in any changes to the studio's staff numbers (something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netherrealm-mobile-shut-down-rumor-layoffs">becoming increasingly rare</a> in the games industry).</p>
<p>As Dinosaur Polo Club tells it,&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a chance to break out of the "minimalist simulation games" for which the studio is known and try something different.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Mvo25Lvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-courtyard.jpg?itok=Exh5gEBb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>would have been a break from tradition for&nbsp;<em>Mini Motorways&nbsp;</em>developer Dinosaur Polo Club.</figcaption></figure><p>Designer Zala Habib says the Dinosaur Polo Club team was "an absolutely incredible" and "driven" group of people, and that collaborating with the "talented" staff working on the game was a "joy".</p>
<p>Over time, Dinosaur Polo Club says that its work on <i>Magic School&nbsp;</i>made it clear that the vision for the game was leading the studio towards a project that required "a far larger team size than the studio could sustainably support".</p>
<p>The studio says that although its staff were excited by the "breadth of visual exploration and specific game systems",&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>'s complexity was "at odds with the intuitive, quick-to-learn gameplay" for which Dinosaur Polo Club has become known.</p>
<p>CEO Amie Wolken says that the studio "simply did not see a path forward for <em>Magic School</em>", but that studios shouldn't be "shy" about sharing information regarding projects that didn't end up working for whatever reason.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=GpFk5y3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-school-canceled-mini-motorways-art.jpg?itok=iSQv-TXP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dinosaur Polo Club wants the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Magic School&nbsp;</em>to be a learning experience.</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of working on&nbsp;<em>Magic School</em>, Dinosaur Polo Club says it'll redirect the staff who were working on the game to a new project "within their celebrated Mini series".</p>
<p>Looks like if you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mini-motorways-launches-september-19th-for-apple-arcade-pc-to-follow"><em>Mini Motorways</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Mini Metro</em>, then you're in luck. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Taking design cues from Astro Bot, the striking gamepad will go up for <strong>preorder on August 9 ahead of its September 6 release</strong>.</p><div title="6525376 - Astro Bot Controller Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2531" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6525376 - Astro Bot Controller Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2024\/07\/29\/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">Astro Bot Limited Edition DualSense</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2024\/07\/29\/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">$80</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Preorders will open on August 9 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET and will be available in limited quantities at select retailers.

            <title><![CDATA[Thank Goodness You’re Here Is A Hilarious Game About Being Helpful]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thank-goodness-you%E2%80%99re-here-is-a-hilarious-game-about-being-helpful.939645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many video game stories basically boil down to being forced to do chores for strangers: all that world-saving, enemy-farming, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/A_Frying_Pan,_Spick_and_Span" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please-find-my-pan stuff</a> is pretty weird when you think about it. <a href="https://thankgoodness.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a>, out August 1 on PC, Switch, and PlayStation, highlights this absurdity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You play as a little salesman–small enough to fit down sink drains and chimneys–who comes to the Northern England town of Barnsworth to meet with the mayor. You immediately wander off into town, which is full of strange folks who all need a hand with something. They ask you to find their missing tools, fetch them meat for their pies, water their gardens, deal with their rat problems, help them with their shopping, and more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You're Here! – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-Vyg4J6RBU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is all done through light puzzles and basic platforming, which is appropriate since you only have two buttons: one to jump, and one to slap. Most things in the world are reactive to your slaps in some way, and it never got old to just stroll the town hitting things and people to see what would happen. Solving puzzles moves the story ahead and opens up new areas, and it was never too tough to figure out where I had to go next or to wander into a task’s solution.</p><p>This lets the game’s setting shine. Barnsworth is a ton of fun to explore, and each quest you’re sent on teaches you more about the town and the relationships between its people. You discover crushes and petty conflicts, fears and dreams, and a bunch of delightful weirdos who, in addition to being people, can also be flowers, rats, or worms. The town itself is full of texture and fun details, from commercials for local brands to funny signs and graffiti. Many seemingly offhand jokes recur and develop–an argument over a trash bin that blossoms into a relationship, a student driver moving around town–and situations change as you solve puzzles as well. All this makes Barnsworth feel active and lived-in, while still being grounded in the day-to-day of small town life.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness</em> is a comedy game, and while my only reference for the genres it’s drawing on is watching <em>Monty Python</em> as a kid, I admired how its absurdity never veered too far into nonsense. It’s also able to poke fun at its characters and their provincial ways without devolving into meanness or using them as punchlines. There’s a lot of love for its setting and inspirations, from the clever use of live-action stock footage of England to the ability to set the language to Northern English dialect. (There’s also a musical number, which I think should be a feature of… well, literally everything.)&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> took me about two hours to complete, though locked Steam achievements and some new tasks I discovered poking back into it this morning suggest there’s more stuff to find off the beaten path. I love the quirky, big-hearted vibe of the game, and I'm excited for my friends better versed in its setting to explain all the very English jokes that went over my head. If you'd like to get a taste of the game before its release later this week, there's a demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366980/Thank_Goodness_Youre_Here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208726/astro-bot-limited-edition-ps5-dual-sense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and Team Asobi — the developers behind the forthcoming <em>Astro Bot</em> — have teamed up to design and release <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/first-look-astro-bot-limited-edition-dualsense-wireless-controller/">a limited edition<em> Astro Bot</em> DualSense controller</a>.</p></div><p>Just look at it. I <em>need</em> it.</p><p>The <em>Astro Bot </em>limited edition controller adds blue controller grips and sci-fi accents and features Astro’s signature pair of bright blue eyes on the touchpad that, based on the adorable trailer, appear to blink at you. (They better blink at you — what’s the point of the eyes if they don’t blink at you?)</p><p>Team Asobi has added a bunch of new interactions between DualSense controllers and the <em>Astro Bot</em> game, some of which I got to experience during <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">my demo of the game at Summer Game Fest</a>. The team has increased the number of textures you can feel through the controller like sand, glass, or metal. All of Astro’s new power-ups will have a distinct feel to them thanks to haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers. In the demo, there are little spark plugs you frequently have to pull out of the ground. The sound effects coming out of the controller combined with the slowly increasing resistance on the triggers made it actually feel like yanking on stubborn wires.</p><p>The controller will be available for preorder on August 9th in select countries, retailing for $79.99. Or you can try your luck buying it from select retailers worldwide on September 6th — the same day as <em>Astro Bot’s</em> launch. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Addam immediately pledges fealty to the Queen, who is stunned by him—Targaryens have long believed that they were the only House able to ride dragons. It’s this trait which makes them godly enough to rule the seven kingdoms. The apprehensive Queen invites Addam to Dragonstone. Addam conveniently leaves out his Velaryon parentage.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The rumor of a rider on Seasmoke has made it to King’s Landing and to the Master of Whispers, Larys. But the assumption that the rider is Rhaena makes Larys not believe it, so he shrugs it off and instead puts his efforts on Aegon and getting him well enough to walk.</p><p>Not everyone on Team Black is on-board with bastard dragonriders, but Mysaria’s guidance on the smallfolk (and the sheer number of Targaryen bastards in King’s Landing) leads Rhaenyra towards a whole new war strategy: “Let us raise an army of bastards.”</p><p>Addam gives Lord Corlys his two weeks’ notice on his shipmate job, avoiding the real conversation they should be having. And Corlys continues that avoidance by simply telling Addam, “Well done.” He is not beating the deadbeat dad allegations.<br></p><p>Daemon finally gets his comeuppance at Harrenhal in the form of the 14-year-old Lord Oscar Tullly. You see, Oscar did not forget Daemon’s subtle advice to kill his grandfather or his guidance to Lord Blackwood to wage horrific crimes against the Brackens. The gathering of all the Riverlords turns into a criminal court when Oscar boldly uses King Consort Daemon to dispense justice on his only ally, William Blackwood. Daemon finally sees the consequences to ruling with such violence. He further questions his ambitions when hallucinating an actively decaying Viserys who offers him the crown. We see Daemon hesitate in his thirst for power for the first time.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, Rhaena and the boy princes begin their journey from the Vale to Pentos, but she sneaks away in search of the dragon on the loose. </p><p>Throughout all the exciting developments in this episode, the writers have Alicent get so depressed she has to go camping. That’s it.<br></p><p>Jace confronts Rhaenyra about the dragonseed plot and gets out some of his own bastard-born issues. He doesn’t trust the lowborn, even though the original search for a dragonrider was his idea. If any low-blood/born Targaryen mounts a dragon and becomes a God, what’s there to say they won’t challenge Jace’s claim to the throne or Rhaenyra’s? </p><p>Alyn and Corlys have the yet another scene by the docks, where Alyn proclaims that he is “of salt and sea” and will not try to claim a dragon. But he does agree to play a part in the Team Black scheme to gather the King’s Landing bastards as a messenger.<br></p><p>The King’s Landing bastards all hear the rumors that Queen Rhaenyra is holding auditions for a dragonrider like she’s Simon Cowell and this is <em>The X Factor</em>. The local drunk, Ulf, who consistently brags about his connection to the Targaryens, needs to be hyped up by his friends in order to agree to go to Dragonstone. The blacksmith, Hugh, reveals his Targaryen heritage to his wife and seizes the opportunity to try his hand at dragon taming.<br></p><p>When the silver-haired smallfolk arrive at Dragonstone, the dragonkeepers do a company walkout. They refuse to help Rhaenyra use dragons as war playthings ridden by anyone regardless of status. Rhaenyra stays the course and lets her half-family know the risks of approaching a dragon.<br></p><p>The scene unfolds as expected, with Vermithor turning this audition into his private lunch. The dragonseeds attempt to escape. Hugh exhibits his pure heart by protecting a fellow dragonseed and going head to head with Vermithor, and this dragon likes the nice guys so he heels to Hugh.<br></p><p>Ulf escapes through the dragon caves until he comes upon Silverwing and I guess she has a thing for sloppy drunkards, because she lets him claim her.<br></p><p>The Green council meeting is interrupted when Ulf can’t resist riding Silverwing over King’s Landing to show the boys he got out of the hood. Aemond angrily runs to Vhagar and rides to Dragonstone, only to see Rhaenyra at the shore surrounded by dragons with riders. Aemond flees, outnumbered.</p><p>Team Black is up three, but will the dragonseeds keep their promises of loyalty? The dragon war begins next week on the second season finale.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2Fshows%2Fhouse-of-the-dragon%2Fc68e69d7-9317-428a-a615-cdf8fe5a2e06" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a></span> is streaming now on Max.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA Sports has released its latest deep for EA Sports FC 25. The latest goes over the brand new game mode coming to the game this year, Rush.</p>



<p>Rush is a new 5v5 game mode played on a smaller field. The mode seemingly replaces the departing Volta mode from past games, expanding on the offerings.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Rush Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gd42YDR4ds8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-25-rush-details">EA Sports FC 25 Rush Details</h2>



<p>Rush will be available for players throughout a number of modes and offer variety to players throughout.  Rush will be available within Football Ultimate Team, Clubs, Manager Career, and standard Kick-Off modes.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Team Rush:</strong> “Bring your favourite Player Item and team up with friends in locked-to-player 5v5 matches.”</li>



<li><strong>Clubs Rush: </strong>“Squad up with friends and take your Clubs experience to the Rush Pitch.”</li>



<li><strong>Manager Rush:</strong> “Get closer to your Youth Academy development throughout the season with new playable 5v5 Rush tournaments.”</li>



<li><strong>Kick-Off Rush:</strong> Choose any team from the available leagues to play in a Rush game.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-rush-works">How Rush Works</h3>



<p>Rush is played on a field that is about 41.5% the size of a traditional 11v11 field. The field sits at 63.7×46.6 meters with a goal to “encourage lateral passing and maintains adequate width that helps prevent the playing area from feeling too narrow.”</p>



<p>The game’s last seven minutes with no half time. The clock only stops when the ball goes out of play. Should a game be tied after seven minutes, a 2:20 golden-goal period will begin. Should it remained tied after that, penalty kicks will decide the winner.</p>



<p>Offside rules have been tweaked to be more similar to that of hockey, with a new dotted offside line.  A player can behind a defender and be considered onside if they aren’t in the attacking zone. Once in the zone, standard offside rules then apply.</p>



<p>Other Rush details include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Four cameras to choose from</li>



<li>Free kicks are always indirect</li>



<li>Two-player social celebrations</li>



<li>Tactical requests for positioning and playcalling</li>



<li>Corner Kicks and Throw-Ins done by the person closest to the ball when it goes out of bounds</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s even more to learn about the new game mode.

                <p dir="ltr">Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is the first player to be welcomed into Club 99 by Madden NFL 25. The honor means Hill has a 99 overall rating in the upcoming football game.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1817906238958469479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X/Twitter</a>, the official Madden NFL account shared a video of Hill receiving his Club 99 gifts and honor. Also known as "Cheetah," the wide receiver was surprised with a suitcase bearing gifts as well as a video message from former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning. "This is absolutely the greatest, or the second-greatest day of my life--well, actually the third greatest," Hill said.</p><p dir="ltr">It also means Hill is the top wide receiver for Madden NFL 25, after being listed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-player-ratings-99-club-and-best-players-by-position/1100-6515843/" data-ref-id="1100-6515843">the second-best option at the launch of Madden NFL 24</a>. However, he was bumped to a 99 overall in last year's game as the season progressed and became the first Dolphins player ever to achieve that rating.</p><p dir="ltr">In college, Hill pled guilty to domestic violence against his pregnant girlfriend. Last year, there was a different assault charge that was eventually settled, with the NFL ultimately taking no action. </p><p dir="ltr">Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-gameplay-deep-dive-shows-off-new-physics-and-here-comes-the-boom/1100-6525245/" data-ref-id="1100-6525245">Madden NFL 25 showed off a redesigned tackling system as part of a deep dive gameplay trailer</a>. The Hit Stick is also getting updated with this year's game, which will be the 20th anniversary of the feature's inclusion in the football franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">EA will undoubtedly unveil more of the Club 99 members (Patrick Mahomes is a given, for instance) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6524523/" data-ref-id="1100-6524523">Madden NFL 25 as we get closer and closer to the game's release date</a> on August 16.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> House Of The Dragon Star Abubakar Salim Was ADDICTED To WoW</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Salim, Kingdom Hearts' "earnestness" and focus on sincere friendship has been a powerful force in his life. He told host Lucy James that the game has influenced not only his work, but "everything [he does.]"</p><p>"Honestly this had such an impact on me," Salim said. "It's so influential. It's so emotional... Darkness comes and takes them away and he just wants his friends back. It was really really magical and it will always stay with me. I think it will always influence any the work I do--everything I do. There's just an earnestness to it. An honestly to it. An authenticity."</p><p>He also opened up about his love of World of Warcraft, creating his own game studio, how he finds time to game as a new parent, and how his favorite game of all time, Golden Sun, desperately needs the remake treatment--and for the record, we agree.</p><p>Salim is the latest star to join GameSpot for its newest show, Star Players. The biweekly program offers a "deep dive into the personal gaming journey of celebrities, musicians, television and movie stars," and has featured Jackass' Steve-O, Lord of the Rings' Dominic Monaghan, Archer's Aisha Tyler, and RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars winner Monét X Change.</p>
