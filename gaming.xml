<p>Two new Agents will make their debut in <em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>Version 2.6. The first, Sunna, is an S-Rank Physical Support Agent who can grant big buffs to party members and facilitate quicker switching of characters with her Ultimate.</p><p>She's joined by Aria, the lead vocalist of the Angels of Delusion, who's an Ether Anomaly Agent with two distinct forms.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-45w-nintendo-switch-charger-at-record-low-compatible-with-switch-lite-and-steam-deck-2000664238</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Powering your Switch doesn’t have to be complicated. While you technically can power your console with any third-party USB charger or a power bank, you’ll get the best performance with only a few. The 45W Nintendo charger by Marsdock is one of the most reliable options around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">It typically sits at an already affordable price of $17, but you can now grab it for only $14 at Amazon – thanks to a 15% discount.</a> This offer applies to the option that includes a 5-foot cable. If you’re looking for something that’s a bit longer, the 10-foot is available for $17, down from $19. Grabbing two of these will knock another 6% off your total. Prime members can enjoy free delivery with their purchase, which brings the overall cost down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speedy and Reliable</h2>
<p>For under $15, you’ll enjoy high-speed charging. It gets your consoles from 0 to 50% in just an hour, offering significantly greater charging stability and higher efficiency than the standard 39W options. The adapter supports input from 100-240V and output up to 15V/2.6A, which makes it great for everyday gaming and travel. Compatibility is just as impressive, as the charger plays nicely with most devices that can be charged under 45W via USB-C. These include Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, Switch TV dock, Steam Deck, and Switch Pro Controller.</p>



<p>Marsdock takes durability seriously with this one, too. The premium cord is rated for over 2000 bends, which ensures longevity, while the solid, well-fitting plug maintains safety and offers efficient power transfer. Additionally, there are built-in multi-safeguards and a cooling system that intelligently monitors temperature, offering protection against overcharging, short circuiting, overheating, and sparking. Basically, you can use the charger anywhere, anytime, without worry.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the 45W AC power adapter, with a 5ft AC extension cord. On a regular day, you’d pay around $17 to enjoy the convenience and fast speeds this charger offers, which is already quite affordable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6960/">The current 15% discount, however, drops it to just $14.</a> Amazon has listed the discount as a limited-time offer, so it’s best to grab it without wasting much time. Now is also a great time to stock up on other gaming accessories and essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot going for less at the retailer. We’re covering the best offers that are worth your hard-earned money, so be sure to check back for the latest drops!</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch Game Voucher is <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-voucher-mario-kart-fire-emblem-discount-1850062170">one of those straight-up good deals</a>. If you’re a subscriber to Nintendo Switch Online, you can buy two coupons for $100, which can then be used to buy two full-price digital games more usually priced at $60 each. Boom, $20 saved, two new games to enjoy. And today, January 30, 2026, marks the very last day you can buy the vouchers. Boo.</p> <p>Back in July of last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-vouchers-pokemon-za-metroid-prime-4-preorder-1851785969">Nintendo announced its intention to kill off the voucher scheme</a> alongside the launch of the Switch 2. With newer game prices nudging up to $70 and $80, it was made immediately clear the vouchers would not be valid for Switch 2 games, but that it <em>would</em> still be possible to take advantage of the scheme for another six months, and that all vouchers bought would remain valid for a full year after the point of purchase. Well, that day has come, and if you want to be sure of a way to pick up a couple of full-price Switch games between now and 2027, this is your last chance. A huge thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/reminder-todays-your-last-day-to-buy-switch-game-vouchers"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> for reminding us of the deadline.</p>

 <p>It’s still a great offer! Nintendo very notably still hasn’t moved on to focusing its new titles on the Switch 2, and the vouchers will save you a chunk off the just-released <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and indeed on April 16’s&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the</em> Dream<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">,</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120">which we learned new details about yesterday</a>. The vouchers are also valid on a really decent range of games including <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, and even the $70&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>. These are all first-party Nintendo titles which are&nbsp;very rarely put on sale.&nbsp;You can see the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0">lengthy full list of eligible titles here</a>.</p> <p>It’s a double-bummer that this isn’t being extended to the Switch 2, given Nintendo also killed off its <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-rewards-program-is-actually-pretty-good-1823654369">splendid gold coins</a>. These were accrued by buying new games, and every dollar spent got you 5c worth of coins. At its best, this meant spending the $100 needed to get two vouchers also got you another $5 off a purchase. Quite why Nintendo’s removed all these advantages and offered no new incentives on Switch 2 is unknown, and a massive disappointment.</p>

 <p>However, if you <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers/">buy a pair of vouchers today</a>, they will remain valid until Jan 30, 2027. That <em>Tomodachi Life</em> was added to the scheme so close to its demise is a sign that&nbsp;maybeNintendo might even put other new Switch 1 releases into the offer even after it can no longer be purchased. No guarantees, though.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-promises-the-world-but-how-much-will-it-deliver</link>
            <guid>1420792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Legend of Zelda. The Witcher. Dragon’s Dogma. Monster Hunter. Street Fighter. And now, GTA 5? Every time South Korean studio Pearl Abyss shows off a new slice of its upcoming open-world, action-adventure Crimson Desert, I feel like I see a new line of influence. Over the six years since its reveal, we’ve seen a fantasy land akin to one Geralt would explore, puzzle shrines in the sky that could easily hover above Hyrule, and a complex combat system rooted in Capcom classics. But in the developer’s latest lengthy video detailing the world of Pywel, a new surprise awaited us: the addition of two new playable characters to join Scottish Jon Snow-alike main protagonist, Kliff Macduff. With whole skillsets of their own for us to now anticipate getting our heads around, I can’t help but be excited, but also cautiously wary. By trying to do so much, does Crimson Desert risk achieving nothing?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I say this as someone who has had the benefit of seeing and playing Crimson Desert more than pretty much anyone outside of Pearl Abyss’ walls, having visited the studio a few months back for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-crimson-desert-hands-on-preview"><u>our IGN First</u></a>. Despite playing a good few hours of it, and having quite a lot of fun with its dynamic systems and satisfyingly flexible action, I still left feeling like I’d only scratched the surface of what Crimson Desert has in store. And I don’t mean that entirely positively – while it’s good to leave a preview knowing there’s plenty more to see, it’s not often you conclude a studio visit still unsure of a game’s big picture. If all those hours of hands-on haven’t successfully communicated what the game is, is something off?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Crimson Desert’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>open world is twice the size of Skyrim’s and larger than Red Dead Redemption 2’s</u></a>. I’ve put over 200 hours into Rockstar’s Western masterpiece and feel like I still haven’t seen everything, so it’s anyone’s guess how much awaits in this world. Crimson Desert’s Pywel is a gorgeous piece of geography, too, with streets filled with life and rivers running with glistening water. That water is also systemically linked to the gameplay options, conducting lightning magic to electrocute those who stand in it, and is transformed into blocks of ice when struck by freezing spells. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all very impressive on a technical level, but leaves me wondering if this is all part of a “we can put it in the game, so why shouldn’t we?” mentality. From what I played, and from talking to the team, the ability to manipulate the elements won’t necessarily have puzzles or challenges built around them to make it a system you’d legitimately find worthwhile. In Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom, for example, you know that if you’re taught how to make giant ice cubes, a puzzle shrine will likely follow asking you to put that lesson into action. Nintendo is a developer that has been making games like this for decades now, though, whereas Pearl Abyss is a studio in its relative infancy, having only released MMORPG Black Desert Online so far. By trying to fit everything it can think a player would like to do in a fantasy open world into Crimson Desert, I fear it may be shooting straight for the moon without learning how to get into orbit first.</p><p>The power trip is there; I just worry about the rest of the journey.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all loops back to this latest revelation that not only will we be playing through Kliff’s story, but stepping into the shoes of two new protagonists along the way. The as-yet-unnamed characters with their own (presumably) complex fighting systems look very fun to play as, don’t get me wrong — I’m particularly drawn to the quick dodging, magic-shifting, pistol-wielding woman who appears at first glance to better fit my more rogue-ish tendencies — but it's yet another layer added on top of an already ambitious cake. I like cake, you can probably tell from a quick look at my face that that would be the case, but when it's stacked so high that even Bruce Bogtrotter would take a pass on it, I worry it's a sign that Crimson Desert should not be trying to have and eat it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other new playable hero is a hulking, giant axe-wielding brute with a machine gun attached to his wrist. If you’ve been keeping up with Crimson Desert, you’ll know that this isn’t your typical fantasy world, but one where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained"><u>dragons, steam trains, and mechs</u></a> also roam around. It’s all very exciting in isolation, and genuinely fun to play as your giant metal monsters come face-to-face with helpless medieval soldiers holding only a shield. The power trip is there; I just worry about the rest of the journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Story and questing are incredibly important to me when it comes to open-world games. The Witcher’s twisting tales and many memorable side stories are what make The Wild Hunt an all-timer in my eyes. The cast of characters in Red Dead Redemption 2 and the way they weave seamlessly in and out of its world are what make it my favourite game ever. Crimson Desert has a lot going for it — the combat is exciting, the world is diverse and beautiful, and its systems are impressively reactive — but I can’t help but feel wary. Most of the missions I’ve played so far, at several different events, have been castle sieges, often ending in admittedly impressive boss battles. But, they’ve all been relatively thin narrative-wise, aside from an interesting detour to a mad inventor’s lair where he’d built <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-golden-star-quest-gameplay"><u>a golden mechanical dragon</u></a>, as you do. I’ve seen little of what’s going to be the thrust story-wise in Crimson Desert as a whole to get me hyped in that regard, nor met any characters that I feel will get close to my heart. And I can’t help but worry that there’s a reason we’ve seen so little of this world’s story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with the surprise addition of two extra playable protagonists to get to know on this adventure that is less than two months away, I worry that Kliff and his friends may well be fun to play as stylistically, but contain little substance within them. I’d be very happy to be wrong, though. I’ve been looking forward to Crimson Desert for a long time now, and have had a genuinely fun time whenever I’ve managed to get hands-on with it. I just wonder how all of these well-constructed building blocks will, in turn, create a greater whole. Will its gameplay systems overlap in interesting ways and be built into mission design? Will authorial intent come to the fore, or will I ultimately feel like a kid being dropped into a sandbox of possibilities with direction? I’m excited, just also a little afraid that by trying to be everything, it may end up achieving nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Still, the developer said he was "saddened" by the reorganization's effects on his colleagues across the wider company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With an on-again, off-again development stretching back almost two decades, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains an ongoing project within Ubisoft, led by its French team based in Montpellier.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft," Mesmar wrote. "Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes. I would direct you to the official press release for more information around the latest organisational structure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This press release was the one which laid out Ubisoft leadership's vision for the company to be split into five "Creative Houses" that lump the publisher's many franchises into groups loosely based around their genre and audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Beyond Good &amp; Evil was announced as being part of Creative House 4, a group dedicated to narrative driven and fantasy-orientated series that also includes Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman and Prince of Persia (though not the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was canned).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Beyond Good and Evil 2 Concept Art</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry," Mesmar continued. "I urge everyone — myself included — to offer support whenever and however they can during these times. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy," he concluded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 originally begun early development in 2007, with series creator and Rayman mastermind Michel Ancel on board alongside the majority of the Montpellier team behind the first Beyond Good &amp; Evil game. Development was put on the back burner while Ancel's team worked on other projects, but Ubisoft re-announced the game with fanfare in 2017 and showed off an in-engine concept featuring space flight and designs to feature multiple solar systems and planets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, however, development struggled — and the project was further impacted by Ancel's departure from Ubisoft and the sad death of its subsequent creative lead Emil Morel.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-with-anc-carry-the-biggest-discount-in-apples-earbuds-lineup-now-at-an-all-time-low-2000664296</link>
            <guid>1420765</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple AirPods 4 are wireless earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation in a compact form that is convenient to carry and use throughout the day. To enhance comfort and stability, Apple redesigned the AirPods 4 earbuds with a more defined shape and a shorter stem with easy-to-use press controls for playing music and answering calls. For a quieter experience, the Active Noise Cancellation feature helps reduce external sounds as they reach your ears. If you prefer to stay aware of your surroundings, Transparency Mode lets you listen to what is happening around you while continuing to listen to your music.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">You can purchase the Apple AirPods 4 at Amazon for $119. This is a savings of $60 and 34% off of their original price of $179.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Some of Apple’s best earbuds for calls, music, podcasts, and more</h2>
<p>AirPods 4 have an optical in-ear sensor that ensures they play audio only when the earbuds are worn and pause when they are removed. They feature a vent system designed for pressure-balanced sound, which can make extended listening feel much more comfortable. Plus, there are physical controls that let you perform common actions, such as controlling music playback and managing calls, without having to access your phone.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation, the Adaptive Audio feature combines noise cancellation with Transparency Mode to adapt to your surroundings. Conversation Awareness can automatically lower the volume of what you are listening to when you begin talking with someone nearby, and then raise it back up after you stop speaking. Voice Isolation uses computational audio to minimize ambient noise and improve clarity in noisy environments.</p>



<p>For music, TV programs, movies, and video games, Personalized Spatial Audio features dynamic head tracking to place sound around you. The high-excursion driver, high-dynamic-range amplifier, and Adaptive EQ work together to deliver a consistent, balanced sound that adapts to how well each AirPod fits your ears. The H2 headphone chip supports the processing required for spatial effects and noise reduction.</p>
<p>The USB-C charging case provides additional battery life, extending how long you can listen. With Active Noise Cancellation, you can expect up to 4 hours of listening time and up to 20 hours with the charging case. Five minutes of charging can provide approximately one hour of listening time.</p>
<p>Hands-free Siri can be activated with either “Siri” or “Hey Siri.” Also, with Siri Interactions, you can respond with a nod yes or a gentle shake no. Audio Sharing lets you share audio with two AirPods. Find My lets you locate your AirPods 4 and the charging case<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">. The AirPods 4 and the charging case are both rated IP54 for dust, sweat, and water resistance. Now’s a great time to buy the AirPods 4, as they’re currently $119, down from $179.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PUBG experience is on the horizon with PUBG: Blindspot, with the release date for early access in the title rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot is the latest release from developers ARC Team and PUBG Corporation, moving away from the established Battle Royale approach to offer a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter.</p>



<p>For all the details on the release date of PUBG: Blindspot, and the exact time you can dive in and start playing, Insider Gaming has you covered with all the key information.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-pubg-blindspot-release-date">What is The PUBG: Blindspot Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via PUBG Corporation</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot releases into early access on February 5, 2026, though the precise date will vary depending on where you are located in the world.</strong></p>



<p>PUBG: Blindspot’s early access release is exclusively available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>, with no news of a console release yet, but there is still some variation to the release date.</p>



<p>This is due to PUBG: Blindspot, like other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> releases, having a global release structure, and not a staggered release like players on consoles usually experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-pubg-blindspot-release">What Time Does PUBG: Blindspot Release?</h2>



<p><strong>PUBG: Blindspot will be released at 9 PM PT on February 4, with the majority of players in the United States able to jump in before the official release date the following day.</strong></p>



<p>Those in the Central US will be able to jump in on that date, with those on the East Coast having to wait until midnight. Meanwhile, those in Europe have a release in the early hours of the morning, and gamers in the Pacific and Australia face a mid-afternoon release.</p>



<p>All times for the release come through <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3143710/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, which is always a reliable source for this type of information, though, as this is an early access release, the times may be subject to change. If there are any adjustments, all the details in this article will be updated.</p>



<p>The table below has the exact release times for PUBG: Blindspot in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Feb. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/comcept-mighty-no-9-recore-shut-down/</link>
            <guid>1420750</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Japanese game developer <strong>Comcept</strong>, known for the games <strong>Mighty No. 9</strong> and <strong>ReCore</strong>, has shut down, <a href="https://gamebiz-jp.translate.goog/news/420020?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Japanese website GameBiz</a>, which spotted a Notice of Dissolution in yesterday's Official Gazette. </p>



<p>The studio was founded by <strong>Keiji Inafune</strong>, a former <strong>CAPCOM</strong> producer who co-created series like <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <strong>Onimusha</strong>, and <strong>Dead Rising</strong>, in 2010. Aside from the small free-to-play mobile game The Island of Dr. Momo, Comcept's debut title was 2014's <strong>Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z</strong>, an action/adventure spin-off in the Ninja Gaiden series for which the studio worked alongside <strong>Spark Unlimited</strong> and <strong>Team Ninja</strong>. Inafune and his team also worked with <strong>Sony's Japan Studio</strong> on the design of the PlayStation Vita exclusive game <strong>Soul Sacrifice</strong>.</p>



<p>Their first brand new project was Mighty No. 9, which Inafune presented as a spiritual successor to Mega Man. The action platform game sought funding on Kickstarter, where it gathered $3.8 million in pledges. Comcept developed Mighty No. 9 with the help of <strong>Inti Creates</strong>, another studio composed of ex-CAPCOM employees. The game was eventually published in late June 2016 by <strong>Deep Silver</strong>, but it wasn't well received at all. On Wccftech, Mighty No. 9 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mighty-9-review-nostalgia-cynic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>was rated just 4 out of 10</strong> by Chris Wray</a>, who summarized his experience with the following words:</p>



<p><em>Mighty No. 9 was designed to be a spiritual successor to Mega Man. If any of that spirit was ever here, it's long since decayed. The game is incredibly frustrating, suffers from bad design choices throughout and offers only middling enjoyment.</em></p>



<p>In the same year, Comcept also released ReCore, which it created in collaboration with the Texan developer <strong>Armature Studio</strong>. This game was received a bit better than Mighty No. 9 (at the time, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/recore-review-eden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it earned an 8 out of 10 from Wccftech's Francesco De Meo</a></strong>), but it still wasn't enough to get publisher Microsoft Studios to give the green light for a sequel.</p>



<p>The following year, Comcept was acquired by <strong>Level-5</strong> and became a subsidiary, helping Level-5 develop games such as <strong>Yo-kai Watch Jam: Yo-kai Academy Y</strong>, <strong>Megaton Musashi</strong>, <strong>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</strong>, and <strong>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</strong>. Now, all its assets will be transferred to the main Level 5 studio.</p>

              <p>Workstation upgrades aren’t cheap. If your desk is in need of a refresh, but you don’t want to shell out big bucks, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">Right now, the 24-inch Lenovo all-in-one desktop computer is down to just $400 at Amazon, after a whopping $199 discount</a>. This bundle comes with everything you need to get started right away, including a pre-installed copy of Windows 11 Home, a wired keyboard, and a wired mouse. However, as you’d expect, the offer is only available for a short time. It’s best to snap it up sooner rather than later, if you want to avoid paying the full $599 price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">Ver en Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>You’re getting a stunning 23.8-inch, spacious Full HD display that pushes 1920 x 1080 resolution. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant picture quality for all types of content, whether you’re streaming your favorite show or creating an important work presentation. Plus, the anti-glare coating keeps the screen easy on the eyes, which is great for long work sessions or never-ending meetings. Speaking of video calls, you’ll find a high-quality 720p HD camera right above the screen. This camera is paired with Mono microphones that isolate your voice from the background noise and deliver it clearly on the other end.</p>
<p>Performance is impressive for day-to-day use. The system runs on a modest Intel N100 processor that features four cores and four threads with a max Turbo frequency of 3.40 GHz. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s still perfectly capable of supporting your everyday needs – like office work, streaming, browsing, checking emails, handling light creative projects – without slowing down. There’s an 8GB DDR4 RAM to keep things running smoothly as you work and play. Again, it’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask comfortably. But as long as you’re not trying to work on a bunch of resource-heavy tasks at once, you will enjoy minimal lag and decent performance.</p>



<p>Storage is taken care of by a roomy 512GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which is plenty for important work files, media content, research documents, and even some games. Note that the system is not expandable, so you won’t be able to increase the capacity as your needs grow, but you can always add external storage solutions to manage space better.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity options include Intel Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. On the wired side, you’re covered with an array of ports, including two USB-A (Hi-Speed USB / USB 2.0), two USB-A (USB 10Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 2), one HDMI-out 1.4b, one Ethernet (RJ-45), and one headphone or microphone combo jack (3.5mm) – that’s all you need to create a fuller, more productive setup. Getting the wired keyboard and wired mouse in the bundle means you’ve already got all you need to get started with work and entertainment right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6959/">The bundle now costs $400, after Amazon took 33% off its usual price.</a> Just note that we’re not expecting the offer to last long. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your workstation without spending a ton, now is your chance to pick a solid, highly-rated option for less. Delivery is free, too, so $400 is all you’ve got to pay today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Call of Duty League has revealed that the 2026 COD Championship will take place at the Michelob Ultra Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The city was previously revealed exclusively by Insider Gaming in a September 2025 report, but the venue has now been locked in as tickets go on general sale later today.</p>



<p>Those who secured pre-sale access can get the drop five hours earlier than regular customers. To reiterate, the Call of Duty League Championship 2026 weekend will unfold from July 16 – 19.</p>







<h2 id="h-back-to-vegas-for-cod-champs">Back to Vegas for COD Champs</h2>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty League Championship, which saw the New York Subliners defeat Toronto Ultra in a stunning 5-0 grand final, also took place in Las Vegas. It was housed at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, while the venue for this year’s COD Champs will be the Michelob Ultra Arena (MUA).</p>



<p>In terms of location and accommodation, the MUA is directly connected to Mandalay Bay Resort. It’s a site capable of hosting 10,000 fans, and it promises to be a fairly stunning event, all things considered.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty League hasn’t got off to the best start in terms of impressions and viewership, but things are expected to pick up as the first Major of the season draws closer. It hasn’t been helped by Black Ops 7, this season’s competitive title, receiving record-low sales numbers and ill sentiments from the community.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Championship 2026 <a href="https://fazevegas.com/pages/cdl-champs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tickets will go on sale</a> later today at 10 AM CST for pre-sale customers and 3 PM CST for the general public.</p>







<p>Are you jetting off to Las Vegas to attend this year’s Call of Duty League Championship? Let us know what you’re thinking about the event on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Cairn allows players to reach new heights with an exploration adventure across the gruelling Mount Kami, and the time it takes to beat the game is variable.</p>



<p>The title from The Game Bakers was released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on January 29, reaching near the top of Steam’s top-selling chart after its release.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering how long it will take to beat Cairn and climb to the summit of Mount Kami, Insider Gaming has all the details on the number of hours you need to sink in.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-cairn">How Many Hours to Beat Cairn?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New heights. Image via The Game Bakers</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cairn has a completion time of around 12 to 15 hours if you focus solely on the main campaign, though this varies based on exploration and the difficulty selected.</strong></p>



<p>The 15-hour completion mark represents a playthrough on Alpinist difficulty, the standard difficulty in the game, and the one you are recommended to start with, with limited exploration, but the early hours are the hardest as you get used to the control scheme.</p>



<p>The more you explore, the longer it will take to complete the main story, but this is where you can find your rhythm in Cairn and full enjoy the world that has been created.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-cairn-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Cairn Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Further exploration in the world of Cairn, or playing on a greater difficulty, will increase the time it takes to complete a playthrough, extending it to as much as 30 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Those who stick with a lower difficulty, but who push to explore more of Mount Kami, can increase the playtime to anywhere between 18 and 25 hours. Again, it all depends on how much you explore and push away from the main campaign.</p>



<p>For those undertaking the biggest challenge on a Free Solo run, playtime is pushed up to between 25 and 30 hours, with the added risk of having to start all over again if you die, as there are no saves and death is final.</p>



<p>All of the above times are variable, however, and largely depend on your playstyle and ability levels, which can either shorten or lengthen the run.</p>

<p>Grab 'em before they're gone</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="046aaf27c8ac8"><a title="Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/046aaf27c8ac8/nintendo-switch-game-vouchers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, folks, the day is finally upon us. Today is the last day that you can buy Switch Game Vouchers before Nintendo consigns them to the 'Discontinued' pile.</p>
<p>The Big N initially made the announcement way back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-will-discontinue-switch-game-vouchers-entirely-in-2026">July 2025</a>, but time has flown by since then, so we thought it was only right to give you one last nudge now that the day of reckoning is upon us.</p>
<p>You have until <strong>11:59pm</strong> in your timezone to make any final purchases, and the vouchers will be valid for one year from the point you buy them — so any that you pick up today won't expire until 30th January 2027. As ever, you'll need an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to get the vouchers in the first place.</p>
<p>For those who have missed out on this offer until today, Switch Game Vouchers come in pairs and can be used on select first-party digital purchases — saving you a few quid in the process. A pair of vouchers costs £84 / $99.98, which, when used on two full-price Switch 1 releases, knocks £16 / $20 off the combined price. It's a pretty sweet deal, we must admit.</p>
<p>While Game Vouchers cannot be used on Switch 2 exclusives, Nintendo has confirmed that it will continue to add Switch 1 releases to the scheme throughout 2026. Just yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> is a part of the Voucher programme and new releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are available in it too (both of which have a paid upgrade option to Switch 2, if you choose to do that down the line).</p>
<p>You can find the full list of eligible games on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/#sort=df&amp;p=0" rel="noopener">Nintendo's website</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most of this offer before it's gone, either head over to the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">Nintendo website</a> and sign in with your active NSO account, or head to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' section of the eShop on your Switch / Switch 2 and select 'Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers'. Do keep in mind that you can't have more than eight active Vouchers on your account at once, so don't go crazy out there!</p>
<p>So long, partner!</p>

              <p>You can add a lot of extra storage to your computer without opening the case with the Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive. Photos, 4K video, game installs, and old project archives all take up valuable space on computers. This desktop-style external drive provides a spot to stash them. The WD Elements Desktop has a black enclosure designed to sit next to your computer tower or monitor, and its 8TB capacity will give you enough space to create several large backup systems and many large media folders. To begin moving files to the external drive, simply plug in the power and the included USB cable, and you’re done.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/">The Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive is available now at Amazon for $171, a $54 savings or 24% off the original price of $225.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An 8TB hard drive perfect for adding extra storage to your PC</h2>
<p>The Western Digital 8TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive is a USB hard drive that provides additional storage capacity for larger media collections and bigger project folders. WD claims that this version of the Elements Desktop offers faster data transfer speeds than previous models, so transferring large numbers of photos, 4K videos, or large game files should be easier and quicker. The Elements Desktop comes pre-formatted to work immediately with a Windows-based PC, but Mac users will have to format it before use.</p>
<p>Setting up the WD Elements Desktop model is easy and does not require much technical knowledge. Once connected to a Windows machine, the Elements Desktop is recognized immediately and can be used to store files after connecting the power and USB cables.</p>



<p>A compact desktop enclosure houses the internal mechanical hard drive in the WD Elements Desktop, and it does not take up much space, especially considering the amount of storage capacity it contains. The WD Elements Desktop is compact, which makes it easy to place beside a computer tower or monitor. The simple black design will blend in well with most computing environments, and the quiet passive operation makes it suitable for long-duration file transfers and scheduled backups.</p>
<p>If you are running out of internal storage space, then this 8TB Elements Desktop model is one of the easiest ways to add capacity to your computer. This hard drive can be used to store full system backups, serve as an archive for older projects, or store large media collections, such as videos and photos, that are taking up too much space on your internal drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6958/">Now’s a great time to buy the WD Elements Desktop model, which is currently selling on Amazon for $171, a $54 savings from the $225 list price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE – Build a Rocket Boy to End Publishing Partnership With IO Interactive on MindsEye]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/</link>
            <guid>1420717</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the developers behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mindseye/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MindsEye</a>, Build a Rocket Boy, are planning to announce soon that they have decided to part ways with their publisher, IO Interactive.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the impending news, the decision is driven by Build a Rocket Boy’s desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future. That includes faster decision-making, simpler communication, and greater control over the player experience.</p>



<p>As part of the change, it’s said that the upcoming MindsEye x Hitman crossover, which was announced during 2025’s Summer Game Fest, will no longer be taking place. Instead, Build a Rocket Boy will continue focusing on more fixes and content updates to build out MindsEye.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the decision to part ways is Build a Rocket Boy’s, rather than IO Interactive’s.</p>



<p>MindsEye launched on June 10, 2025, to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-reviews-creep-in-worst-rated-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible critic reviews</a>, with just 6% of critics recommending the game and receiving mostly negative to mixed reviews on Steam. Prior to the game’s launch and just a couple of weeks earlier, Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, took to Discord in a Q&amp;A to claim that the negative pre-release reception of MindsEye was part of a paid campaign by a third party to make a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio”.</p>



<p>Build a Rocket Boy remained mainly silent following the game’s release, instead focusing on trying to fix and improve the game. Co-CEO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" type="link" id="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leslie Benzies reportedly told staff </a>on a call one month following the game’s release that 300 developers were at risk of redundancy, saying the “studio and game’s struggles” were due to “internal and external saboteurs”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted IO Interactive for comment, but did not receive one prior to publication. Should one be given, we will update this report.</p>

<p>Both current and former employees at Build a Rocket Boy can contact me securely and anonymously at&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="582c37352c3735303d363c3d2a2b373618282a372c373635393134763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&nbsp;if you would like to weigh in on current events or share your story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve seen Crimson Desert’s impressive 15-minute gameplay video, you might be wincing at the thought of it running smoothly on your console or PC. Well, right now, the developers at Pearl Abyss are focusing on optimization to help ensure a “smooth” experience when the game comes out in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. It’s dense with detail, and you can zip around quickly on the back of a dragon. Based on the video, below, Crimson Desert will be a demanding beast — it will be interesting in particular to see how it runs on the Xbox Series S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Will Powers, director of public relations at Pearl Abyss America, the developers are doubling down on the "optimization phase” as we speak, telling former IGN video extraordinaire Destin Legarie in <a href="https://youtu.be/5hPXEVG-X5g?si=4A95xvuCARBCLl1f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new interview</a> that this is the focus ahead of Crimson Desert’s March 19 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have gone gold. Now comes further, further optimization to make the game run as good as it possibly can,” Powers said. “And that’s as important of a part. So that's the phase we're currently in between now and launch to make sure that the experience when players eventually get their hands on the game, is as smooth as possible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers wouldn’t go into specifics on the graphics settings that will be available on consoles, but did confirm Crimson Desert has PS5 Pro enhancement. You can also turn off the particle effects in settings, although Powers said they do convey important information during fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss built a new engine for Crimson Desert, and Powers explained that it’s capable of providing a 4K60 native presentation, complete with ray tracing, without the aid of graphics technology such as DLSS or FSR. But of course you’ll need powerful hardware to enable it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, we'll show 4K 60 native, sure, with ray tracing on, that's not done through DLSS or FSR, that's done natively in-engine,” Powers said. “And then if you want to further optimize then you can tweak all the settings and do all the things, but we want to show that you don't have to… like the game itself should be able to stand on its own.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And on that decision to go with a proprietary engine:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not going to say that the game is absolutely perfectly optimized, but within the engine it's using every single thing. So it's as optimized as it can be within that space. That's not possible otherwise. And so rendering thousands of trees within draw distance, it does those things better than an off-the-shelf engine could because of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Off-the-shelf engines weren't able to deliver the uncompromised vision that the developers set forth to create with this game. So, they needed to create their own engine in order to deliver on that vision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Powers called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Pearl Abyss.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ncr-power-armor-from-the-fallout-tv-show-makes-its-way-into-fallout-76-but-youll-need-to-spend-30-to-use-it</link>
            <guid>1420708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Inevitably, the New California Republic Power Armor that made such a dramatic appearance in the latest episode of the Fallout TV show is now in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>. But rather than sell it via the in-game shop and thus allow players to buy it with Atoms, Fallout 76’s virtual currency, it is only available as part of a standalone DLC bundle priced $30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In lieu of a brand new Fallout video game, Bethesda has leaned heavily on Fallout 76 to capitalize on boosted interest in all things Fallout following the breakout success of the Prime Video TV show. Fallout 76 has Walton Goggins’ character The Ghoul dishing out quests, for example. There is a New Vegas-style expansion (Season 2 is set in New Vegas — or what’s left of it). And now Fallout 76 has the NCR Power Armor that Maximus uses to fight a pack of Deathclaws in Episode 7.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Never underestimate the power of brand recognition. <a href="https://t.co/vuHbfcQ6EB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vuHbfcQ6EB</a></p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2016573413502906575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That NCR Power Armor is a big talking point among Fallout fans for a number of reasons. It’s brand new — we’ve not seen its type in the video games before — and it sparks all sorts of questions about the Fallout lore and what we thought the NCR was capable of. Setting aside the fact that an NCR Power Armor appearance in Fallout 76, which is set <em>before</em> all the other Fallout video games, makes little sense lore wise because the NCR didn’t exist yet, its price has become the big talking point.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The NCR Power Armor is available in Fallout 76 via the Mojave Bundle, which includes the following:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li><li>NCR Flag</li><li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li><li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li><li>Legion Legate Outfit</li><li>Player Title Prefix – “Advictoriam”</li><li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix – “Tribune”</li></ul><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/f76-1769766158551.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fallout 76 Mojave Bundle costs $30. Image credit: Bethesda.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The long and the short of it is that if you want the NCR Power Armor, you need to hand over $30 for this entire bundle — a standard practice these days really, where DLC bundles often cost more than entire video games, and items you might not necessarily want are thrown in to improve “value.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have said the bundle is overpriced at $30, and accused Bethesda of “cashing in” on the show by not making it available to buy for Atoms, which most players will have stashed away for DLC like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, the price of the Mojave bundle is ridiculous,” one fan said. “It’s exhausting to watch a studio that once had credibility reduce everything to cash grabs. I guess a lot of people will pay for it anyway. Good luck.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment shared by many across the various Fallout subreddits, Steam’s own forum, and social media. “Yeah this is a hard pass for me. Put it in the Atom shop,” said a disgruntled fan. “£26.99 for eight items, two of which are just words!!!” added another. “Then you've got two C.A.M.P items, a Power Armor paint, a weapon, plus an outfit with a helmet.... Not even a cheeky few hundred Atoms thrown in! That's actually peak lmao, but whilst people keep buying it, Bethesda are going to keep selling it!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This DLC includes a set of armor that I'm never going to wear because the Legate armor doesn't fit in thematically with anything, it also includes a flag and a neon sign, none of which are of particular value to me,” reads one negative Steam review. “And with the Burning Sands starter bundle you at least get a free bullet machine. This bundle gives you nothing of value. For me the only reason to pick this up is the NCR Power Armor, which I can understand cashing in on the show, but they clearly didn't want to put it on the Atom shop for the people who have saved atoms. I would have paid $10 for this item no problem.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 2 Video Game Details - Characters, Locations and Factions</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, not all players agree. Many are pointing to the $30 price point being standard for bundles of this type in Fallout 76 (and in other games), and others are saying you can simply choose not to but it if you don’t like it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it overpriced? Yes. Is it undervalued? Yes,” countered one fan. “It's still not predatory, because you can simply NOT BUY IT. You lose out on zero actual gameplay by not buying it. You also don't gain any gameplay from buying it. If having this bundle gave me some type of advantage in-game, that might be predatory, but this is just another bundle. I've skipped plenty of those over the years. This bundle replaced the Atomic Angler bundle, which I believe was also $30. There's ALWAYS going to be a cash bundle out there. Just don't buy it. It's that simple.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You know as weird as it is I just don't mind,” said another. “There's no gameplay content or quests / locations locked behind the purchase, so far every expansion has been released for free, there's plenty to do in the game and loads of other cosmetics and camp stuff to get for free or buy with atoms from challenges, the game (imo) doles out tons of Atoms anyway, and from my understanding these bundles typically go on more than 50% off sale pretty regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I mean like, whatever, you don't need to day one buy every single piece of content, if Bethesda releasing these lil whale drops occasionally means the vast majority of the game can stay free for the vast majority of players that's a good thing. Just be glad we're not a gacha or a lootbox game or something with actual predatory pricing.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda will of course be hoping that as many fans as possible decide that $30 is a reasonable price to pay to patrol the desert of Burning Springs like you’re straight out of the Fallout TV show. Data shows that the show has fueled an increase in player numbers for all Fallout games, with some newcomers dipping into the likes of Fallout 76 for the first time. I imagine in that context, this NCR Power Armor will prove quite popular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 76 itself, meanwhile, is free-to-play until February 5, with the Season 2 finale set to broadcast on February 3. If you need to catch up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-releasing-all-episodes-of-fallout-season-1-for-free-on-youtube-ahead-of-season-2-finale">Amazon has released Season 1 for free on YouTube</a>. If you’re up to date, it's worth checking out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunner-explains-whats-going-on-with-mr-house-ahead-of-season-2-finale-and-how-there-still-isnt-a-new-vegas-canon-ending"><u>the Fallout co-showrunner's tease about Season 2, Episode 8</u></a>, which sounds like it will have a significant impact on The Ghoul, Lucy, and Maximus.

            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p><p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well [<strong>NOTE:</strong> Eurogamer commenter @f53b3d06 has said this is a mistranslation by Dexerto. Rather than the actress being 'hyped' for the film, Fares instead said: "It's kind of a done deal that it will star... what's her name, the one that is so hyped/popular... Sydney Sweeney", as he struggled to recall her name at first]. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," Fares said of the actor.</p>
<p>But, while this may be the case, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

		<p>I’m going to call it a day early: January is done! It’s been a long, dry (well, in terms of alcohol) and often dull sort of month, and it always feels good to get it out of the way. I can almost feel the sunshine coming, or at least, a slight rise in the UK’s temperature and for the drizzle to get a bit lighter.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">been playing Highguard this week </a>and, well, I don’t really see why the world has decided to pile on it. It’s a fun enough (and free) diversion. Whether it’s got any longevity, we’ll have to see, but it deserves more of a shot than some people are giving it. Besides that, I got to have time with the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/grid-legends-switch-2-review/">GRID Legends</a>, and Feral Interactive have done a great job of bringing it across, with a heap of user-friendly graphics options. I’m embarking on a heap of reviews and previews now, which you’ll get to read about next week!</p>

<p>First in the alphabet and first to turn up was <strong>Aran</strong>, who’s had another week of sneaky shenanigans in Star Wars Outlaws. He said, “I’ve just taken to travelling around each planet, taking contracts and seeing what opportunities I can find. It’s been fun to pit the various factions against each other while getting them to all like me. It makes it easier for me to steal the valuables from their vaults too.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has gone all coy, saying, “You know I can’t tell you, you tease.” But I think he’s being a bit too secretive don’t you? He’s actually been playing Nioh 3 for review, and while he can’t say much more than that before embargo, there is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/theres-a-fresh-demo-for-nioh-3-with-a-week-to-go-before-launch/">a demo out now</a> if you want to try it for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> dived back into Dynasty Warriors: Origins for the new DLC. He tells us, “I was quickly reminded what an excellent job Omega Force has done in rebooting the series – Visions of Four Heroes is somewhat similar to the Xtreme Legends expansions we used to get back in the day, though some of the battles are a little too big/prolonged. Still, I’m enjoying the new weapon classes.” That’s not all though, as he also checked out the game everyone is talking about, “I also dabbled in some Highguard but it’s fusion of gameplay ideas just isn’t for me. This disappointment has probably been amplified by my short time with Deadlock which is ticking all my boxes and genuinely feels like the evolution of a subgenre.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has played all sorts of random bits and bobs this week, though his highlight has been Rebellion’s reboot of 90’s classic Speedball. He says, “I played the original on my trusty Amiga, some three decades ago! Absolute madness! review coming soon!”</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has played a bunch of the new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-review/">Cult of the Lamb DLC, Woolhaven</a>. He said, “It’s nice to get back into the game. I’ve had to move on to review something else though, which you’ll hear about next week.”</p>
<p>Having wrapped up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/cairn-review/">Cairn for review</a>, and halting his playthrough of Ghost of Yotei just before the final mission, <strong>Gamoc</strong> made the poor decision to then ruined his chances of feeling alive, telling us, “I couldn’t get to sleep last night so I gave up and played Factorio for six hours overnight and now I’ve had no sleep whatsoever.” Maybe a nap is in order?</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/26/code-vein-2-review/">Code Vein II</a> for our review, and Romeo Is A Dead Man! He’s fully on a wild anime action game grind! Meanwhile, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing Ebola: Village and I Hate This Place for review and continuing to enjoy Gigasword at bedtime. He’s also spent some time jetting through space with friends in Void Crew.</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been on a secretive mission to Germany that you’ll hear all about next week. All he can say for the time being is that he had a currywurst delivered to him by a robot with a cute cat face on his trip back.</p>
<p>And what about you? Played anything this week?</p>

            <p>Well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> developers Blizzard have decided to have a bit of extra fun with all the junk that'll fill up the new player houses rolling out in full with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-releases-in-march-bringing-voidstorm-plague-on-all-the-new-houses">March's Midnight expansion</a>. The MMO's getting a prop hunt mode dubbed Decor Duel, designed to act as a "small diversion" from the whole Xal’atath-led void invasion business.</p>

<p>Decor Duel was one of the many incoming WOW things outlined during yesterday's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250385/catch-up-on-the-state-of-azeroth-in-our-recap">State of Azeroth showcase</a>, which saw Blizzard detail all of their 2026 plans beyond the launch of Midnight. It's prop hunt as you'd likely expect prop hunt if you're a veteran of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> or more recently the likes of Call of Duty. Two teams of five on a map in a city or neighbourhood, one with the ability to turn into random items via illusion magic, and the other tasked with hunting down their hiding spots amid the area's regular fixtures.</p>
<p>"You might not defeat the Void and save Azeroth by taking part in this event, but it’s a great way to find a bit of fun in the face of the ever present and growing threat the Void presents," Blizzard admit. Prop hunt will be coming with patch 12.0.5, which is set to arrive not long after Midnight's launch on March 2nd. That same patch will also bring void assaults, which are a chance to fight back against the whole Xal’atath thing by slapping up some enemies invading random spots throughout the world.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The first major update arriving after Midnight will be 12.1 in the summer, which Blizzard wouldn't get into specifics on in terms of name or setting, but they did reveal that it'll come with "a new zone with maximum level content, new raid, and a new season with an updated Mythic+ dungeon Pool, new PvP and Delves rewards", plus an overhaul of the Friends system. After Blizzcon in September, another update called 12.1.5 will be bringing "Labyrinths" to the MMO, these being new mega-dungeon-esque adventures designed to play like the shorter Delves added as part of The War Within. Blizzard describe them as follows: "large sprawling experiences you can tackle all at once or a bit at a time depending on your own schedule. They will have a different form and reward structure than are currently available in Delves but retain the core elements of exploring and besting foes alongside your Delve companion."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the publisher's 2026 plans also include a mysterious new mode from the team who've previously created pirate-themed battle royale mode Plunderstorm and Remix.</p>
<p>So, there are the things. If you've not kept abreast of all the hulabaloo that's been going on ahead of Midnight around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcraft-devs-blizzard-will-offer-folks-a-free-wardrobe-change-just-before-midnight-following-fashion-fee-furore">WOW's transition between two types of gear transmog system</a>, you'll be glad to learn Blizzard have stepped to try and limit the gold costs involved in existing players making the switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 76 Devs Lock Insane Power Armor Behind $30 Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-power-armor-fallout-devs-lock-paywall/</link>
            <guid>1420690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios recently unveiled an awesome new ‘Mojave Bundle’ to eager Fallout 76 players, especially those neck-deep in the second season of the television show, which comes to an end in under a week. The Mojave Bundle contains a kick-ass new power armor skin that replicates the recent one revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the TV series</a>, but there’s a huge catch.</p>



<p>Despite the Mojave Bundle boasting a few more cosmetics, some fans are outraged that it costs a whopping $30 – or £26.99, if you’re on the other side of the pond.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-vegas-ranger-power-armor-locked-behind-pay-barrier">New Vegas Ranger Power Armor Locked Behind Pay Barrier</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 players are contending with the revelation that one of the coolest suits of power armor ever added to the Fallout universe (let’s not get into <em>that </em>debate) is locked behind a hefty paywall.</p>



<p>If you want to acquire Fallout 76’s Mojave Bundle, you’ll need to part ways with $30 of your hard-earned cash. It’s not available to purchase using in-game currency (Atoms), nor do you get any kind of a discount for having a Fallout 1st <em>premium </em>subscription.</p>



<p>As a side note, check out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 fans in Japan</a> are especially annoyed at Fallout 1st…</p>



<p>The Mojave Bundle comes with:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ranger Power Armor Paint</li>



<li>NCR Flag</li>



<li>New Vegas Neon Sign</li>



<li>Ad Victoriam (Super Sledge)</li>



<li>Legion Legate Outfit</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix</li>



<li>Player Title Prefix &amp; Suffix</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s not a tiny bundle by any means, but it’s 100% cosmetic and has a high price point, which is the core problem here. To put this into perspective, the base game currently costs under $10, so the cosmetic pack is more than three times the cost of the game (when it’s not on sale).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Most people would be playing Fallout 76 via a paid-for subscription, like Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, so they’re even more unlikely to invest cash in the ecosystem to acquire a $30 cosmetic bundle.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Bethesda <strong>pledged </strong><span>there would be no paid DLC for Fallout 76, then later unveiled Fallout 1st, which caused a bit of outrage by paywalling items many thought they should all&nbsp;</span>get, like the treasured stash box and survival tent mechanics.</p>



<p>Admittedly, every expansion to hit Fallout 76 thus far, including the recent Burning Springs expansion, has been <strong>completely free</strong>, so it could be argued that a $30 cosmetics bundle isn’t rocking the boat too much and should be eaten up nicely by the die-hard fans of the post-apocalyptic world.</p>







<p>Do you think $30 is too much for a Fallout 76 cosmetics bundle? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Portal OLED Scheduled for 2026, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-oled-scheduled-for-2026-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1420687</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that PlayStation is developing an OLED version of the Portal, following the success of the original. </p>



<p>We have heard about several leaks about the upcoming PlayStation 6 handheld over the last year, with reports that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dockable</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not as powerful</a> as the PlayStation 5, and more surfacing online. Now, new information has surfaced online on the existing PlayStation handheld, the Portal. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-portal-oled-model-is-reportedly-in-development">PlayStation Portal OLED Model is Reportedly in Development</h2>



<p>The claim about the PlayStation Portal OLED model comes from KeplerL2 on <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/page-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Neogaf</a>. In the thread, Kepler first mentioned that the PS Handheld will be RDNA5 before discussing the Portal. They then stated that the original Portal model “seems to be a success,” with PlayStation working on “another version this year.” When asked which version they were referring to, Kepler responded, “OLED version.” </p>



<p>The PlayStation Portal received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-gets-cloud-streaming-in-surprise-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surprise cloud-streaming update</a> last year, adding the ability to stream select PS5 games directly to their devices with PS Plus Premium. The library includes some big names like Astro Bot, Borderlands 4, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Fortnite, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, Sword of the Sea, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>

            <guid>1420678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement reveals that the original Final Fantasy 7 is re-releasing on Steam, replacing the 2013 version. </p>



<p>Nowadays, all we hear about Final Fantasy 7 is the remake instalments, Intergrade has already been released for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Switch 2</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-series/" id="3453">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth and Part 3 </a>have been confirmed for both platforms as well. However, today we aren’t talking about any of the remakes; instead, we are talking about the original Final Fantasy 7 title. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-re-releasing-to-replace-2013-version-on-steam">Final Fantasy 7 Re-Releasing to Replace 2013 Version on Steam </h2>



<p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2016920806258069772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/square-enix/" id="149">Square Enix</a> has posted a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/39140/view/514107648813039662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> on Steam regarding Final Fantasy 7’s re-release. The new version will rename the current version to FINAL FANTASY VII – 2013 Edition, and this version will no longer be available for purchase once the new version is released. </p>



<p>Existing owners of the 2013 version of Final Fantasy 7 don’t need to worry, as they will both retain access to the previous version and gain access to the new version at no additional cost. This means players can have both versions in their library, but there is no save data compatibility between them. Players with FF7 2013 save data can only use it for the 2013 edition, and the same for the new release. </p>



<p>Moreover, Square Enix has yet to provide a release date or an explanation for re-releasing Final Fantasy 7 on Steam. From what I can see, there are no noticeable upgrades in this version. </p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth could release for Xbox and Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this summer</a>. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 will bring back the iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowboarding mini game</a>.

            <p>According to Walton Goggins, we can all expect something "profound" to happen in the Fallout season two finale next week.</p>
<p>Goggins, who plays The Ghoul/Cooper Howard in Amazon's Fallout adaptation, has said his character's motivations have always been about finding his family. Of course, over the course of two seasons, we have seen the highs and lows of Cooper Howard's family life with his wife Barb and daughter Janey via flashbacks. Meanwhile, in the present day, a now Ghoul-ified Cooper is still searching for his family, and has been for centuries.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, will he find them in the final episode of Fallout season two? Well, that remains to be seen, though Goggins has teased something "profound" happening not just to The Ghoul, but to the sweeter than sweet vault dweller Lucy as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that in episode eight, without giving something away to your audience, something profound happens for both the Ghoul and Lucy that would also be my favourite, but we can't talk about that," he told <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674">EW</a> ahead of the Fallout finale.</p><p>Goggins added viewers will also learn more about what Cooper was doing at that birthday party, way back at the start of season one. "I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in season one was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party. Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere," the actor said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Lucy MacLean actor Ella Purnell, the second season's finale will be a "conflicted, explosive and character-defining" cocktail for the naive and trusting vault dweller.</p>
<p>"You get to see Lucy be a real human with real human problems, and I think at times, because of her strength and her optimism, it doesn't always feel that way with her," Purnell explained. "But in this moment, and that maybe says a lot about what her choices and decisions are, she's flawed and she's actually just getting more and more human."</p>
<p>Ooh, curious!</p>

If you’ve ever intrepidly looked up a Paradox game, seen a million DLC expansions on the Steam page, and fled screaming into the woods, rest assured that Paradox have you in their eye. It’s doubtful they’re going to change anything about their broad DLC strategy, mind, but they’re aware that some players may feel reluctant to purchase older Paradox games that have dozens of add-ons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
“We're well aware that if you go in and see a barrage of DLCs, it might be a bit off-putting to buy the game directly if you're a new gamer, but [like we] mentioned we do bundling to get different types of starter packs, to make it easier to get on board,” commented CEO Fred Wester in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHWAVZVRxW">the company’s latest financial earnings call</a> with investors. “We also work with pricing in different territories, but also deep discounting and publisher weekends and whatnot. We also have DLC subscriptions on – is it a majority of our games, or at least maybe half of our games? 
</p>
<p>
“So that's an option as well. You pay a smaller sum to try everything out, and you can do it on a monthly basis. So those are the strategies we've tried so far, and they're working really well. But we continue to to try to make our offerings more appealing to more gamers.”
</p>
<p>
Why exactly are people put off by DLC barrages? Wester doesn’t spell it out, but for me, the agonising introspective journey goes like this: I do not want to spend all that extra money, but I’m also worried that I’m missing out on something crucial if I stick with the base game – yes, even though Paradox are in the habit of chunky free updates. For all I know, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron">Hearts of Iron</a> 4’s La Résistance expansion is the difference between Pétainist ignominie and Charles-de-Gaullic triomphe.</p><p>I could go read some reviews of La Résistance or one of the game’s 25 other add-ons, but that would take several extra minutes of research and this was supposed to be an impulse purchase. ARGH! I’m going to buy a Creative Assembly game instead.

<p>
I don’t think there’s a way out of this predicament, while Paradox are in the business of making fat stacks over several years by way of paid expansions alongside free updates and re-promotion. Part of it is that Paradox are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">renowned for ‘long tail’ post-release development</a>, so even a brand new Paradox grand strategy game with a modest handful of preorder cosmetics looks suspect - a submerged Great White waiting to explode from the waves and guzzle you down like some loathsome, cash-strapped, time-poor penguin. Swim penguin, swim! Lest you too accidentally take out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> subscription.
