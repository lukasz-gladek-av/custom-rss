			<p>Steel Seed starts strong with an atmospheric cut scene with cinematic camera angles and a tease of something special. A woman is trapped in a lab, seemingly undergoing a medical procedure, with a scientist in the background who seems to be battling to save her life. While the rest of the game doesn’t reach these dramatic heights, it’s a solid, if generic, stealth action game which I really enjoyed playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Seed - Extended Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54GQWU6FHB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Skip forward a few millennia and our heroine, Zoe, wakes up in an underground facility and discovers she is now a cyborg. She seems to take this fact, along with the news that humankind is dead and she is the only one who can bring them back, rather matter-of-factly. I would have spent a good ten minutes freaking out if that happened to me, but nope, off she skips along with her new robot drone pal Koby to meet S4VI (or as it’s pronounced, Savi), a super buff AI who struts around a vast library with little more than a loin cloth covering his AI Ooh-I-Says.</p>


<p>More exposition reveals that Zoe’s dad has digitally stored humankind while the planet fixes itself, and to return to the good old days Zoe needs to go find her dead father who has inconveniently split himself into four digital shards. Each shard is located within a nest of mechs controlled the evil robot overlord Hogo, and you can tell he is the bad guy because he has red eyes and a very big gun.</p>
<p>Each of the four areas has a distinct visual style, but they all roughly follow the same format with sections of platforming followed by large open areas that require stealth. The platforming includes lots of clambering around ledges in an Uncharted style, but that’s joined by wall running, bounce pads, zip wires and timed puzzles. It’s usually obvious where you have to go next, and checkpoints are spaced quite generously, so while there’s nothing new or surprising, it’s well put together and usually lots of fun.</p>

<p>Like most action adventure games, as long as you are quite close to where the next platform or ledge is, you get a tiny boost to make sure you grab it even though gravity would suggest you would not. The exception here seems to be zip wires, some of which are located at the end of wall running sequences, which are annoyingly difficult to grab onto.</p>

<p>After a lengthy section of being athletic you will encounter a larger area patrolled by different types of robots, signalling that it’s time for stealth. Again, there’s little surprising or new here, with disruption fields substituted for long grass to hide in, sending out a pulse being the sci-fi equivalent of throwing a stone to attract an enemy – all things any stealth fan should be familiar with but with a technological twist.</p>
<p>It’s here where Koby, your sci-fi Assassin’s Creed Eagle, comes in to play as you can take control of him and use his vision to check out enemy locations and patrols. He can also flip switches, drop mines, glitch fields and attack enemies, but if he is spotted then he will get a good battering and become inactive for a minute or so.&nbsp; Zoe always utters an anguished cry of “Oh no! Koby!” when het gets knocked out, which seems a bit silly after then twentieth time, as by then she should know he’s always going to come back to life moments later.</p>
<p>When hidden, Zoe can stealth kill most enemies, but if she’s spotted, you may need to fight your way out. She has the usual light and heavy attacks and a dodge, and you can add in ground slams, perfect dodge attacks and more by buying upgrades. The enemies do have weak points, the game tells you, but as they are tiny and – going against convention – the same colour as the rest of the enemy. It was only through trial and error I worked what they were. Zoe herself can’t attack these points, but she can control Koby and use him as a rather rubbish gun that runs out of steam after a couple of shots. It’s a nice idea but badly explained, and only really useful near the end of the game when you have upgraded both Zoe and Koby. One nice feature is the ability to hack the enemy robots and turn them to your side, which is very satisfying when used on machine gun turrets that can can wipe out most of a level in seconds.</p>

<p>While there are only seven enemy types, they are placed strategically on the maps to give you a challenge, and if one is alerted many from the surrounding area will head into battle. Fighting, while fun, is really the last resort as the robots are vicious and will soon kill you. They are also quite clever,&nbsp; if they are chasing you and you hide in an air duct or on top of a platform they won’t just mill around, complain for 20 seconds and then go back on patrol, they will throw grenades to flush you out.</p>
<p>Sprinkled throughput the game are chase sections with Zoe rushing through platforming levels that are collapsing around her, side on scrolling sections, flying, and even a surfboard, all of which keep things from becoming too repetitive.</p>
<p>As the game comes to its conclusion, the plot twists shouldn’t really surprise anyone, but I did find it annoying that after making you stealth through pretty much the entire game the final boss battle is a hack and slash affair which is rather more difficult if you have been spending most of your upgrade points on stealth and utility mechanics.</p>

<p>I applaud the fact that Zoe’s father is not voiced but some posh English man as genius scientists usually are, instead he has a strong modern London accent which means “Nothing” is pronounced “Nuffink”. Unfortunately, the actor seems to have been hurried along as the lines are missing emotional depth. He sounds more robotic than the robots!</p>
<p>I finished the game in around 15 hours but only scratched the surface when it comes to secrets and collectables, so there’s a reason to replay if that’s you thing. I really enjoyed Steel Seed. It’s got rough edges but its packed full of ambition and with more time and a bigger budget the developers, Storm in a Tea Cup, are certainly ones to watch out for.</p>

			<p>In the recent past, we have seen the rise of titles heavily inspired by gaming greats that offer an enjoyable time thanks to the high quality of their experiences, which makes it easy to see past the almost complete lack of innovation. At the same time, some of these games allow fans of genres that don't see much representation nowadays to experience more of what they love. This is exactly what Storm in a Teacup's Steel Seed is: a very solid action-adventure game that immediately brings the Uncharted series, and in turn, other games that have been heavily inspired by it, like the Star Wars Jedi series, to mind that delivers a solid action-adventure experience that all fans of the genre will surely like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250325135131_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Steel Seed is set in a dark sci-fi world dominated by machines where humanity is on the brink of destruction. Following a short dream-like sequence where the main character, Zoe, briefly converses with her father, the young woman wakes up in a world that feels all but alien to her eyes. And not just the world around her, as she has been turned into a robot without any explanation. The new capabilities this new body grants her, however, are just perfect for the journey that awaits her inside a hostile underground facility, at the end of which she will find the answer she seeks. This journey won't be easy, and it will only with the help of her drone companion Koby and the mysterious S4VI, who seems to be guiding her towards the answers her father, Dr. Archer, wanted her to find, that Zoes will be able to understand what happened to humanity, why every machine she encounters is intent on killing her and the involvement of her father in the events that led to the almost complete extinction of humanity.</p>
<p>The story of Steel Seed is narrated using both typical cutscenes and a series of optional data logs hidden inside the underground facility that provide additional information on the events that led to the current state of the world. In terms of character development, main character Zoe is mostly developed using dialogue sequences during gameplay, of which there are quite a few. The young woman often converses with the drone Koby, who speaks a language only Zoe can understand, while traversing the imposing underground facility, making these sequences feel like the monologues Aloy often launches into in the Horizon series.</p>
<p>The series developed by Guerrilla has obviously been a massive influence on Steel Seed, as shades of Zero Dawn's story can be easily spotted during the adventure, as can those of NieR Replicant's, although without the massive emotional impact the first entry in the series created by Yoko Taro has. Still, despite the feel of been-there-done-that, the story is entertaining enough, and provides enough motivation to continue plunging deeper into this dark, mostly mechanical world.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250325141017_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of gameplay, Steel Seed doesn't stray too far from boundaries set by cinematic action-adventure games like the Uncharted series or, more closely, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (more than its sequel), due to the almost complete linear nature of the adventure. As such, those who played these games will find the experience rather familiar, with a balanced mix between not particularly challenging climbing/platforming sequences, which are made easier by ledges being visibly highlighted, and stealth and combat scenarios.</p>
<p>While the platforming sequences are not challenging at all, they are still enjoyable thanks to their varied design, some choice camera angles that provide stunning views of the mechanical world of the game, and Zoe's excellent mobility that makes her a joy to control, although jumps do feel a little too floaty. Platforming is, without a doubt, one of the strongest suits of the Steel Seed experience, as the vast majority of traversal challenges are well thought-out, and some even feel like proper puzzles that involve not only maneuvering Zoe but also using TOBY to activate switches, which also come in a time-sensitive variety, making every platforming sequence really nice to play.</p>
<p>If traversal and platforming in Steel Seed are heavily influenced by the Uncharted series, combat has been influenced by a slew of other games. Going from the footage released before the game's launch, Steel Seed may feel like a Soulslike, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Sure, the genre spawned by the FromSoftware series definitely influenced Steel Seed's combat in some ways, but aside from the weighty feel and the ability to use light and heavy attacks, the game by Storm in a Teacup feels nothing like the Souls series and the genre it has spawned. The lack of a stamina bar, for example, makes combat in Steel Seed feel very different from your typical Soulslike, as do the many abilities Zoe can use, including a perfect dodge which rewards players with buffs and other advantages. The lack of a stamina bar, however, also highlights what's, in my opinion, the biggest issue of combat in the game: the lack of depth. With only some exceptions, the vast majority of enemies, which include both long-ranged and melee fighters, can be defeated by mashing the light attack button, rendering most combat mechanics a little pointless. Some enemies will fight back and resist getting stagger-locked by multiple attacks, to be sure, but still, combat is definitely not the game's fortè.</p>
<p>The acceptable, but not particularly deep, combat highlights even more how Steel Seed is, first and foremost, a stealth game. In this regard, the game delivers a basic, yet solid, experience, providing Zoe with all the tools she needs to sneak past enemies unnoticed, which include the ability to use walls as cover and shoot different bullet types using TOBY that can be used to distract enemies, silent takedowns against unaware enemies, taking advantage of anything the environment offers, including some special fields that completely conceal Zoe's presence and so on. Thanks to a varied level design, stealth gameplay stays engaging from beginning to end, although the experience tends to drag a bit towards the end. Considering how stealth is never required to proceed, it is entirely possible to always fight enemies head-on, which is a nice touch that gives players more options regarding how they want to tackle the campaign.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250327132136_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Possibly attempting to address the repetition that inevitably settles in a few hours into Steel Seed, the game features an interesting take on character progression that also does a good job of teaching players how to use the many abilities at Zoe's disposal. During the course of the adventure, Zoe is able to collect Glitch, an experience points-like currency that can be used to unlock different skills available via three different skill trees. For skills to become unlockable, however, players will need to complete some very simple challenges that often involve using other skills properly, such as scanning the environment to tag enemies, use Perfect Dodges a certain amount of time and so on. This organic approach to character progression works extremely well, as it doesn't force grinding or anything else that doesn't fit right into the natural flow of the adventure, and it's a really great feature that I hope will make an appearance in other games to reduce the amount of tedious busy work that often gets rewarded poorly.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Steel Seed takes full advantage of the engine's Lumen tech to deliver a great sense of scale and the sort of artificial illumination one expects to see in a world made of steel inhabited by machines, which look great not only during regular gameplay but also during the many cinematic setpieces the game features. The developer also used lighting in a rather clever way to implement the infamous "green paint" that is meant to guide players to their next objective. While I generally dislike this sort of hand-holding, I feel Steel Seed definitely required something of the sort, as navigating the world can get a little confusing at times, due to its design. Character models are far less advanced, but they do their job reasonably well, also thanks to solid animation work, and properly fit the world they roam.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Steel Seed 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Webz1jpyOcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On PC, Steel Seed offers plenty of additional options over the console releases with support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR 3, Intel XeSS, and UE5 TSR in terms of upscaling solutions and plenty of graphics options to tweak, including post-processing effects. Both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR also supports Frame Generation, with the former also offering Multi Frame Generation on the RTX 5000 series, though top-end GPUs are unlikely to require any sort of frame generation to hit high frame rates. On my system (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game had no trouble running at above 100 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and High quality preset. A benchmark session held in the Chained Towers area confirmed the generally solid performance of the game, returning an average FPS of 102, with a 60 FPS 1% low. Being a linear game, Unreal Engine 5 handles the experience well, as I have experienced no stuttering issues outside of some minor hiccups that had no major impact.</p>

<p>Steel Seed is not going to win any awards for innovation, but a game doesn't always need to be innovative to be engaging. While the vast majority of the game's core features have already been seen, when put together, they deliver a solid experience that fans of games like Uncharted and the Star Wars Jedi series will surely enjoy. Just don't expect to find deep combat, character customization, or anything too advanced: the game is all about Zoe's journey into the mysterious world she finds herself thrown into, and every game mechanic is at the service of this story, for better or worse.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Steel Seed may not be the most original game around, but its action-adventure formula serves as a solid tribute to the Uncharted and Star Wars Jedi series, offering an intriguing story and setting, engaging traversal and stealth mechanics, and impressive world design that captures the scale of a world overtaken by machines. Unfortunately, the lack of originality, along with a general lack of depth, does impact the experience, as the gameplay starts to feel repetitive a few hours in. Still, Zoe’s journey is one worth taking for those seeking an experience in the vein of Naughty Dog’s beloved dormant franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that a movie based on the classic Sega racing property&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and two major Hollywood figures are apparently attached to the project.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie is in development at Universal, and attached to direct is none other than&nbsp;<em>Transformers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>director Michael Bay.</p>

<p>Deadline says that Bay will also serve as a producer, and he'll take that role alongside&nbsp;<em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Immaculate&nbsp;</em>star Sydney Sweeney, although it's not clear whether she'll be starring in the movie as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=jZZt5Gh6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outrun-movie-report-racing.jpg?itok=K5MdwUGM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting a movie.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently attached to write the script for&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>is Jayson Rothwell, who's penned the likes of the Mads Mikkelsen-starring&nbsp;<em>Polar&nbsp;</em>and the dark Santa Claus killer comedy&nbsp;<em>Silent Night&nbsp;</em>(the 2012 movie starring Malcolm McDowell, not the 2021 Keira Knightley movie).</p>

<p>It's likely that when it comes to developing <em>OutRun</em>, Universal has been buoyed by the phenomenal success of recent video game adaptations like A&nbsp;Minecraft Movie (the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">terrible first trailer</a> for which did nothing to dent its box office)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats" rel="nofollow"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a>.</p>

<p>There's also a success closer to home to which Universal can look, namely that of&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, the movie adaptations of which cumulatively&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a> back in January.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that video game movies are big business, but adapting&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em>, a franchise that has historically been very light indeed on story, might be a trickier prospect than doing the same for&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-outrun.jpg?itok=zSpnQYNA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-outrun.jpg?itok=Ci3Lw1vf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is cleaning up at the box office.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, we don't know what kind of creative direction the&nbsp;<em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie will take, and it's likely to be a while before we hear anything concrete; after all, the movie is almost certainly in its early stages right now.</p>

<p>Still, if you just can't wait for more video game movies, there are plenty on the way. Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for 2027</a>, and movies based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinobi-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingmakers-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">Kingmakers</a>&nbsp;</em>are all apparently also in the works.</p>

            <p>Ah, well thank heck for that. I thought I'd spent my weekend hunched over a screen in a goblinesque sweat-trance. No! Says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> voice actor Andy Serkis: I was simply partaking in some vital culture; a veritable Wildean sophisticate. Film industry folks thought games were "not an art form in any stretch," <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/andy-serkis-says-the-film-industry-could-not-exist-without-video-games">Serkis told Game Watcher</a>, "and gradually it's taken over the film industry, which could not exist without it." Take that, Roger Ebert's dead wrong dead horse of a dead body.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have called myself a gamer at all,” said the Lord Of The Rings actor, who also worked on Enslaved: Odyssey to the West with Alex Garland. "But I was always very interested in next generation storytelling. Around 2004, when we made Heavenly Sword, I started our <a href="http://www.imaginariumuk.com/">performance capture studio</a> with a view to create immersive stories outside of traditional 2D experiences, like cinema or television.”</p>

<p>"There used to be a terrible snobbery from the film industry with [videogames] being the lesser cousin,” Serkis said. “That they didn’t really tell stories, it was just about the gameplay, hack ‘n’ slash, and killing people". But games have "come of age" since then, he says. "There are actors coming out of drama schools who want to be in videogames and see it as another part of the palate of what it is to be a performer.”</p>
<p>I assume Serkis is mostly referring to things like the importance of motion capture tech to modern filmmaking, though I'm always a little resistant to the easy gratification offered by these "games are legitimate art now" arguments. Since, you know, they always were and you don't need either filmmakers or actors to tell you that. But also: it's vitally important that no-one ever take a videogame remotely seriously under any circumstances. Please trust me on this. Anyway, here is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/nov/08/andy-serkis-enslaved-interview">fun Guardian interview from 2014</a>, in which Serkis reveals that he was first approached for Ninja Theory's Heavenly Sword by his mortgage broker. "He showed me a trailer after we'd discussed mortgage rates and I thought it was fantastic".</p>
<p>As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 itself, I think I'm probably allowed to tell you that Serkis is very good in the turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, as are the entire voice cast, as is…oh, nope, skirting dangerously enclose to the embargo here. I'll have a review up tomorrow morning anyway. You may be able to piece together my feelings by reading my last two "what are we playing?" entries. Eep.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its launch on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">anyone looking to preorder a Switch 2 console</a> will be able to grab a few accessories to go along with it. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> Pro Controller will be one of the devices available to purchase, and while it looks very similar to the first-gen model that launched alongside the Switch in 2017, Nintendo says one aspect of it has been significantly improved.</p><p>On the official <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/hardware/nintendo-switch-2/tech-specs/">Nintendo website</a> (via <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-takes-50-less-time-to-charge-than-the-switch-pro-controller/" rel="nofollow ">NintendoSoup</a>), the company claims that the controller can now be charged in approximately three hours when the console is in sleep mode--around half the time of the original Pro Controller. What makes this interesting is that the new Pro Controller has a smaller 1070 mAh battery when compared to the original--it has a 1,300 mAh battery--and for overall battery life, Nintendo says that you can expect up to 40 hours of use depending on the game you're playing and usage conditions.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="360066760" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>Following the success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-3-will-tease-new-character-at-the-end-of-the-movie/1100-6527743/" data-ref-id="1100-6527743">Sonic the Hedgehog movies</a>, another Sega franchise may be heading to the big screen. Director Michael Bay and actress Sydney Sweeney are reportedly working on an adaptation of Sega's 1986 arcade racing hit OutRun.</p><p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Bay is attached to direct OutRun from a script by Jayson Rothwell. However, Sweeney is only signed on as a producer, not a star. Sweeney is one of the busiest actresses in Hollywood, and her upcoming roles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sydney-sweeneys-barbarella-remake-targets-director-edgar-wright/1100-6523413/" data-ref-id="1100-6523413">include the Barbarella remake</a>. She has also shifted to producing her own projects.</p><p>The OutRun arcade game doesn't have any story to speak of, since it and all of its follow-up games are racing titles. There hasn't been a new game in the series since 2009's OutRun Online Arcade. Hollywood studios have previously attempted to adapt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shinobi-movie-is-in-the-works-drive-and-scott-pilg/1100-6439363/" data-ref-id="1100-6439363">Shinobi</a> and other classic Sega games, but only Sonic came to fruition on the big screen.</p><p>Universal does have a good track record for making successful video game movies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/" data-ref-id="1900-6418051">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> was one of the biggest hits of 2023 with $1.363 billion worldwide, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-review-too-much-plot/1900-6418144/" data-ref-id="1900-6418144">Five Nights At Freddy's</a> far exceeded expectations with its $297.1 million worldwide take.</p><p>The huge box office of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie</a> may also push more video game adaptations to the big screen. But few films could ever hope to match its $717.8 million box office to date, and it's likely to reach over $1 billion by the time A Minecraft Movie finishes its theatrical run.</p>

Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Baldur’s Gate 3 hit a player concurrent peak of 169,267 over the weekend — an incredible feat for a single-player focused role-playing game in its second year. Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation nor Xbox player numbers publicly available.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the release of Patch 8, Larian chief Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say he expects Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Feeling good today about where we are with BG3," Vincke said. "Patch 8 got a lot of people playing again. It took a lot of development effort but I'm happy we did it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With mod support thriving, I think the game will now continue to do well for quite some time. It gives us room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can and that focus is more than welcome. We've got big shoes to fill."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, as Larian has signalled, is the final major update for the game and draws a line under what has been a remarkable time for the developer. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Baldur’s Gate 3 launched to critical acclaim</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed"><u>enormous commercial success</u></a> back in 2023, and has continued to sell strongly throughout 2024 and into 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian shocked the gaming world by confirming its intention to leave Baldur’s Gate 3 and Dungeons &amp; Dragons behind to work on a brand new game, which it teased at various points before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-says-its-full-attention-is-on-its-next-game-media-blackout-for-the-foreseeable"><u>announcing a media blackout to focus on the new mystery project</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">D&amp;D owner Hasbro, however, has teased plans to continue with the series. Speaking to IGN at the Game Developers Conference, SVP of digital games at Hasbro, Dan Ayoub, let on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated"><u>with Larian moving on</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says"><u>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in Baldur's Gate."</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that," Ayoub said. "And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ayoub didn't offer any further information about whether this "stuff" would be a full-blown new Baldur's Gate in the works, or some sort of crossover like the characters had with Magic: The Gathering previously. However, he did acknowledge that he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but that making one will likely take a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he said. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/21/paul-rudd-returns-in-nintendo-switch-2-ad-34-years-after-his-famous-snes-commercial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In 1991, Nintendo featured an unknown actor named Paul Rudd in its United States launch commercial for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Fast forward to 2025, and Paul Rudd is more than 30 years deep into an acting career that has seen him star in films like <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em>, <em>I Love You, Man</em>, and the Ant-Man franchise, as well as fight with Captain America and Iron Man in blockbusters like <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. To pay homage to the now-famous actor’s early work as just a guy who’s Playing with Power, Nintendo brought the movie star back in the first US commercial for Switch 2.</p>

<p><span><span>This commercial's release coincides with the announcement of the United States preorder date, which was initially scheduled for April 9. However, the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">tumult surrounding President Trump's tariffs on foreign goods</a> delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in both the United States and Canada. Last week, Nintendo revealed the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0dea30b2-7e9b-43f4-a82e-9a35679b42ca" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-begin-april-24-in-us-with-updated-pricing-for-certain">new United States preorder date as April 24</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can see the new Switch 2 commercial starring Paul Rudd below.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uGXvdbL1ys" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>The ad, which emphasizes the Switch 2's online multiplayer and GameChat social features, plays with the SNES's "Now You’re Playing with Power" tagline. Instead, it uses the line, "Now You’re Playing Together." To provide the context to its YouTube subscribers, Nintendo also uploaded the original 1991 SNES ad featuring Paul Rudd, which you can see below.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Super Nintendo Entertainment System arrived on US shelves on August 23, 1991. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5, 2025, with the delayed preorders finally starting this Thursday, April 24.

Following <a href="https://gameinformer.com/node/123750">last week's leak</a>, in which screenshots surfaced, Bethesda's official social media accounts shared an image teasing an announcement tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bethesda took to its accounts on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter to share an image with the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion font with only "IV" displayed and an armored mask in the background. The tweet says, "Tomorrow, 11:00 am EST" and lists URLs to the Bethesda Twitch and YouTube channels. When you visit the YouTube channel, you are greeted by the same art, with a livestream that has the title, "All will be revealed...."</p>

</article><p>The screenshots that hit the Oblivion subreddit last week, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" target="_blank">users started digging into the website files of game development studio Virtuos</a>, potentially indicating that the studio is responsible for the remaster. Immediately following the widely publicized leak, the studio's website was taken offline. Virtuos is a Singapore-based development studio that typically runs support for larger studios or ports the works of other studios to new platforms. Most recently, Virtuos has been assisting Konami with developing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, the upcoming remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.</p>

<p>We don't know the platforms or release date of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, but widespread speculation is that it will release very soon on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. However, we will not know for sure until tomorrow when the livestream occurs at 11 am Eastern / 8 am Pacific. To watch it live, you can head to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-official-teardown-cutting-edge/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few months later than expected, Sony shared an official PlayStation 5 Pro teardown to provide a better look at the system's cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>The teardown covers pretty much every aspect of the system, starting with its design that sets it apart from the original PS5 model and its slimmer revision featuring a "louver" sitting between the main unit and the cover, which makes the console quieter. The rear design has also been changed for more efficient airflow over the other PS5 models.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's official teardown obviously also provides a great look at the system's internals, which highlights the new fan designed to generate airflow more efficiently, which features the same number of blades of the regular PS5 fan, the strategically placed high number of screws to reduce electromagnetic interference, the large motherboard made of more internal layers than the base PS5's motherboard to achieve faster memory performance, the added DDR5 memory chip, and the innovative use of liquid metal, whose usage in the base PS5 proved to be the right choice, as liquid metal technology was integral when designing the PS5 Pro. All of this, and more, can be found explained in greater detail on the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/21/playstation-5-pro-teardown-an-inside-look-at-the-most-advanced-playstation-console-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launched worldwide in November. It is currently the most powerful system on the market, allowing for advanced visual features not available on other systems, as seen in the recently released<a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-resolution-new-comparison-highlights-how-xbox-series-x-closer-ps5-pro/"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia%E2%80%99s-gpu-drivers-are-a-mess.1170102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/653115/nvidia-gpu-drivers-black-screen-crashes-issues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s GPU drivers have been a disaster over the past four months. It all started when Nvidia released its drivers for the RTX 50-series cards in January, and introduced black screen issues, game crashes, and general stability problems for new and existing graphics cards. Now, yet another new hotfix has emerged to fix even more issues introduced by Nvidia’s buggy drivers.</p><p>Nvidia GPU owners have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">struggling for months</a> with a variety of issues reported on Reddit and in Nvidia’s own support forums, with most people fixing their issues by rolling back to the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fdrivers%2Fdetails%2F237719%2F" rel="sponsored">December 566.36 driver</a> before the RTX 50-series. Those fortunate enough to secure one of Nvidia’s latest GPUs aren’t able to roll back to the old drivers as they simply don’t support the new RTX 50-series, so Nvidia has been issuing a series of updates to try and address the problems.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649599/nvidia-driver-576-02-bug-fixes-crashes-download-game-ready">The 576.02 driver release last week</a>, which included lots of bug and crash fixes, seemed like it would finally solve the issues that have plagued Nvidia’s driver releases over the past few months, but it has made things worse for some. Posters in the Nvidia forums have been reporting issues with GPU monitoring utilities not reporting the correct GPU temperatures since installing 576.02, so Nvidia was forced to release a hotfix driver yesterday to address this issue.</p><p>The latest <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5650/~/geforce-hotfix-display-driver-version-576.15">576.15 hotfix</a> also includes fixes for lower idle GPU clock speeds for RTX 50-series owners, and some fixes for certain games flickering after updating to last week’s 576.02 driver. I would highly recommend installing this hotfix driver if you’re on an RTX 50-series GPU or you regularly set your PC to sleep mode and use GPU monitoring utilities like Afterburner to control a custom fan curve based on GPU temperatures.</p><p>While this latest hotfix driver addresses some important issues, Nvidia forum posters are <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563719%2Fannouncing-geforce-hotfix-driver-57615-released-42%2F" rel="sponsored">still reporting</a> lots of game crashes, performance issues, and stuttering when using G-Sync in certain games. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F563010%2Fgeforce-grd-57602-feedback-thread-released-41625%2F" rel="sponsored">Nvidia is currently tracking</a> at least 15 open issues with its 576.02 driver that will hopefully be addressed with the next official driver release.</p><p>Nvidia has released four hotfix drivers over the past two months, which is a surprising amount of hotfixes between the main Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) releases. It’s also surprising because, for the most part, Nvidia’s GPU drivers have always been stable and better than the AMD and Intel competition at game compatibility, performance, and crash-free gaming.</p><p>Nvidia’s driver issues come after a turbulent launch of the RTX 50-series cards. Some RTX 5090 power cables <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">have been melting</a>, Nvidia had to admit that some of its new GPUs had a “rare” manufacturing issue that meant they were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618748/nvidia-admits-the-rtx-5080-is-affecte">missing render units</a>, and some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">Nvidia’s marketing claims have been questionable</a>. The RTX 50-series cards have also been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603863/nvidia-rtx-5090-out-of-stock-paper-launch">difficult to find in stock</a> at retail prices, leaving many PC gamers frustrated by Nvidia’s latest GPU launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Dinosaurs are cloned, genetically engineered to be better entertainment attractions, and hunted for sport. But absurdity aside, a few of those films have some surprisingly gruesome deaths, especially for a franchise aimed at family audiences.</p><p>An Indominus Rex casually flings a soldier into a tree before ripping through the rest in <em>Jurassic World. </em>A raptor pounces from the shadows to end Dieter Stark’s (Peter Stormare) creepy demise in <em>The Lost World</em>. And who could forget Zara Young’s (Katie McGrath) wildly over-the-top air-and-sea takedown by Pteranodons and a Mosasaurus—still the franchise’s most elaborate (and strangely beautiful) execution. With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-trailer-every-dinosaur-mutant-1851755947"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em></a></span> ushering in a new era of dino disasters on July 2, let’s see which of its predecessors captured the imagination and snatched our breaths away best with its deaths.</p></div></div><div><p>No <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>World </em>movie takes a bigger nosedive in quality purely because of how absurd its death scenes are than <em>Fallen Kingdom</em>. This is the movie where a random mercenary gets his arm chomped off by a tranquilized raptor because he casually walks into its cage—as if he forgot he was in a dinosaur movie and not working security at a mall. Then there’s the rich auction guest who stands motionless under a cage as the Indoraptor lines up the kill like it’s posing for a horror movie poster. And let’s not forget the rooftop scene where the Indoraptor literally stalks a child like Dracula before impaling itself on decorative horns. These aren’t just far-fetched deaths—they’re cartoonishly choreographed in a way that makes it hard to take any of them seriously. It’s like the writers asked, “What’s the dumbest way someone could die?” and then made it canon.</p></div><div><p><em>Jurassic Park III</em> isn’t the worst movie in the franchise, but it’s hanging onto second-to-last by the claws of a raptor—and even those feel a little dulled here. The deaths just don’t hit as hard. Sure, there’s a moment or two worth replaying, like the Spinosaurus tearing through a plane crash like it’s made of tinfoil and then slamming its teeth into M.B. Nash (Bruce A. Young) mid-sprint. And the raptor snapping Udesky’s (Michael Jeter) neck after using his screams to lure the others to its trap was terrifyingly cool, and a chilling introduction of the dinosaur’s enhanced strategic intelligence. But when you stack it against the rest of the franchise, where people get ripped in half, stomped into the dirt, or juggled mid-air like chew toys before being swallowed by sea monsters, this one feels tame. It flirts with the chaos, but never commits to the carnage—and in a franchise famous for spectacular deaths, that just doesn’t cut it.</p></div><div><p>Few <em>Jurassic</em> movies waste their potential quite like <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>. It’s not that it lacks dino action—on the contrary, the Therizinosaurus vs. Giganotosaurus showdown is an apex predator brawl worthy of the franchise’s legacy, and the locust swarm burning across farmland like biblical vengeance is straight-up haunting. But when it comes to the franchise’s trademark death scenes? <em>Dominion </em>blinks. Characters are snatched, mauled, or incinerated—and yet somehow, we’re usually watching it from behind a tree or right as the camera cuts away. In a series that once let a raptor tear into Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) offscreen because it was the ‘90s, it’s wild that a 2022 blockbuster felt the need to censor itself. For all its scale and spectacle, <em>Dominion</em> ends up in the bottom half of the franchise rankings simply because it forgot what made the chaos so thrilling in the first place: letting us watch.</p></div><div><p>If there’s one <em>Jurassic</em> sequel that leans into the brutality, it’s <em>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</em>. Eddie Carr’s (Richard Schiff) death is both gruesome and gutting—after heroically holding the trailer in place to save Ian and Sarah from falling, he’s yanked from his SUV by two T-Rexes and torn in half like a rag doll. Dieter Stark’s is slower but no less disturbing—separated from the group, he’s stalked through the jungle by Compies that chip away at him bite by bite until his screams fade into silence. Also, poor Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) gets dragged into the juvenile Rex pen by the adult and left to be mauled, whimpering, by the baby in what feels more like a training session than a kill. Where other films glance away from the gore, <em>The Lost World</em> stares straight at it, making every death feel earned, brutal, and unforgettable.</p></div><div><p>Look, no <em>Jurassic Park/World</em> film’s ranking on this list is as dependent on the majesty of one death as <em>Jurassic World</em>.  But, there was no one death in this movie (and arguably any other movie from the franchise) than the choreography of Zara being tossed around in mid-air by two Pteranodons, dropped into the sea where another Pteranodon dives in to snatch her up (THEY CAN SWIM TOO?!) before a fucking sea-dwelling Mosasaurus emerges from the sea to swallow them both whole in a gorgeously executed example of the cycle of life. The fact all of that happened in less than 40 seconds is a testament how much gruesome detail you can pack into a scene when you don’t cut away from the mayhem. </p></div><div><p>Compared to the glossy CGI bloodbaths that would follow in future <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World </em>films, the OG that started all looks almost prehistoric, and that’s what makes it the most gruesome. Without advanced special effects producing swarms of Pteranodons and Quetzalcoatluses or toothy battles between gigantic T-Rexes, Steven Spielberg relied on giving us an unflinching look at the struggle to live. A man being snatched off the toilet and into the jaws of death feels more visceral than one computer generated dinosaur gorging on another. The stakes feel more real. Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) stealthily being outsmarted by a Velociraptor in the jungle, before conceding the she’s a “clever girl” as his final words, might be the most iconic death in <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World</em> history. In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ill-never-get-over-the-original-jurassic-park-1710713069&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ill-never-get-over-the-original-jurassic-park-1710713069"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a></span>’s case, less is more: human suspense will always trump CGI theatrics when it comes to blood and gore. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The biggest challenge The Witcher IV will face is convincing players that Ciri is just as important as the iconic Geralt of Rivia, if not even more, and to present this fact convincingly, according to the game's Cinematic Animation Director.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@G4G_Revenant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenant</a>, David Cordero, who also worked as the Cinematic Animation Director for Cyberpunk 2077, commented on the challenges the next entry in the series will face coming after one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time, saying that the biggest will be convincing players that Ciri is just as important as Geralt, if not even more. This, according to Cordero, will be the hardest part, as Geralt is a really charismatic character that has already appeared in multiple games, whereas Ciri has only appeared in The Witcher 3. The rest, on the other hand, is not going to be difficult, as the studio is going all in for gameplay and combat, and is constantly listening to players' feedback.</p>
<p>To present Ciri in the proper way in The Witcher IV, the development team is leveraging the lore department that was formed during the development of the Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty expansion, and will focus on showing what's actually happening and not just on showing why Ciri is a proper witcher. The lore department will also make sure that every little detail fits properly into the game's world.</p>
<p>Speaking about the narrative elements in The Witcher IV, CDPR's Cinematic Animation Director revealed that Cyberpunk 2077 will be a point of reference for the game, as CDPR did some outstanding work on the first-person open-world RPG that has, in many ways, surpassed what was done in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="Downgrade #11 CD Projekt | Dev Español cuenta cómo se hizo Cyberpunk y el futuro de The Witcher 4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hlelBwxBax8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Being as much a The Witcher nerd as those in CDPR's lore department, I can only concur with David Cordero's statement, as Ciri plays an extremely important role in the books written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The best thing about the novels, however, is how Ciri's importance is balanced with Geralt and Yennefer's importance, so hopefully, the development team will be able to strike a similar balance in their highly anticipated game that is not launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">until 2027</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us season two is under way, and this weekend we were treated to the second episode. 'Treated' is, perhaps, the wrong word to use here. After all, there were some pretty major story beats in this episode, and well, you know voices on the internet have opinions on what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<p>We knew it was coming, but it happened perhaps sooner than many of us expected. In the second episode of The Last of Us season two, Joel is killed by Abby.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no bad blood at all between Pedro Pascal and Kaitlyn Dever, who play Joel and Abby on the show. Soon after the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsnfw9uzpL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Pascal shared a heartwarming picture of the two on set</a>, captioning the image: "Thank you, scene partner. You little miracle."</p>

<p>But, while Pascal and Dever are smiling in the photo, there is no denying that the moment of Joel's death was tough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-actor-pedro-pascal-discusses-the-last-of-us-season-twos-most-shocking-moment-yet">for the cast and viewers</a>. Perhaps it was harder for those coming to the show without any prior knowledge of the source material. This user seems to think so.</p>

<p>Some have said they will <a href="https://x.com/B3ARZATTO/status/1914157825669976290/photo/1">never emotionally recover from seeing Ellie lying next to Joel's dead body</a> at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>"Ellie crawling to Joel’s body and cuddling up next to it.. that was way worse than the game," <a href="https://x.com/giannaispunk/status/1914137102511415581">wrote one viewer</a>.</p>
<p>"Does it ever keep y'all up at night knowing how Joel was ready to end it all? to accept his fate in death, until he heard Ellie yelling for him to get up? What little energy he had left was used in trying to push himself to live for her," <a href="https://x.com/pascalfanatic/status/1914528859787039152">another viewer wrote</a>, referring to the way Joel lifted his fingers while lying on the ground in a beaten bloody mess.</p>

<p>Here's another user so upset by the whole ordeal that full caps lock was the only way to write. "ELLIE LAYING ON TOP OF JOELS BODY WAS THE MOST FOUL THING I’VE EVER SEEN," <a href="https://x.com/xkimberlynx/status/1914136143781671400">they wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Some viewers have just decided to go into denial, and as far as they are concerned Joel is absolutely fine, thank you very much.</p><p>

"I'm still convinced Joel'ss death scene was a mass hallucination like no that actually did not happen," <a href="https://x.com/dayasrussell/status/1914330722610864196">wrote one hopeful viewer</a>.

<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/wizardjarin/status/1914266574346658117">this user</a> has summed things up quite well for all of us watching The Last of Us season two. They captioned an image of Pascal bobbing about in the ocean while on holiday as this: "New photo of Pedro Pascal swimming in our tears."</p>
<p>Agree, we have probably all cried an ocean's worth since episode two aired earlier this week. At least he's still alive to look after Grogu in The Mandalorian, I suppose…</p>

A developer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> has commented on recent research that pitted various AI models against the classic courtroom series' first installment.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ace-attorney-dev-reacts-to-the-game-being-used-to-test-how-smart-ai-models-are-maybe-this-kind-of-deductive-power-is-the-strength-of-humans/">Automaton</a>, Hao AI Lab used Ace Attorney to try and benchmark four AI models' memory, reasoning skills, visual understanding and strategic decision-making - with some performing better than others.
</p>
<p>
While none of the AI models managed to beat the game, Google Gemini and Open AI's o1 managed to reason their way through to its penultimate episode.
</p>
<p>
"This index uses Ace Attorney to evaluate the AI's practical ability to 'find inconsistencies in testimony, select appropriate evidence to support them, and refute them most effectively'," AI researcher K Ishi <a href="https://x.com/K_Ishi_AI/status/1912330532274483213">wrote</a>. "As a result, the best 'lawyer' was o1."
</p>
<p>
The research was designed to test each AI's ability to consider "the entire flow of the case and make decisions without being limited to current testimony", Ishi added, as well as having the "ability to consider the timing of 'meaningful' situations and create the most effective strategy". 
</p>
<p>
Each AI's understanding would also have to remain flexible enough to react to fresh evidence coming to light mid-trial, he continued. You can watch each of the four AI models tested play the game via the video in the embed below.

"How should I put this, I never thought the game I worked on so desperately 25 years ago would come to be used in this way, and overseas at that (laughs)," <a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1913719762762477685">wrote Ace Attorney developer Masakazu Sugimori</a>, who composed the game's soundtrack and voiced antagonist Manfred von Karma.
</p>
<p>
"I find it interesting how the AI models get stumped in the first episode," Sugimori continued, in response to seeing the research. "[Ace Attorney director Shu] Takumi and [executive producer Shinji] Mikami were very particular about the difficulty level of Episode 1 - it's supposed to be simple for a human. Maybe this kind of deductive power is the strength of humans?"
</p>
<p>
"The reason why Takumi and Mikami were so particular about balancing the difficulty level of Ace Attorney's first episode was because 'there was no other game like it in the world at the time'," Sugimori added. 
</p>
<p>
"It had to be a difficulty that would be acceptable to a wide playerbase, but it had to avoid being insultingly simple too. They were going for the kind of difficulty that gives you a sense of satisfaction when the solution hits you."
</p>
<p>
And as far as we know, no AI has been programmed to feel that same sense of satisfaction - yet. Come back in five years, though, and it'll be interesting to see whether the AI models of 2030 can beat the game.

            <p>The maker of cryptic block-seeding puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseed-pilgrim">Starseed Pilgrim</a> has announced a new game in which you are invited to do the unspeakable and "kill gameplay". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-end-of-gameplay">The End Of Gameplay</a> will be an exploratory 2D platformer according to the tags on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3120040/The_End_of_Gameplay/">Steam page</a> but anyone who has played the work of creator Droqen might predict those labels to prove looser than a toddler's shoelace. Enjoyers of obscure and poetic wanderings in minimalist spaces will probably be happy with the trailer below.</p>

<p>The creator describes it as "like Starseed Pilgrim, but only all the parts that nobody told me they cared about". This is a strong pitch but in what direction I cannot tell. Starseed Pilgrim was a mysterious blockbuilding platformer released back in the hellsands of 2013, in which you had to plant various seeds and discover their effects to go... somewhere? I never quite got it, to be honest. But that's okay, I'm not alone.</p>
<p>"I think of Starseed Pilgrim as a game that is enjoyed, mostly, by indie game devs, and this new game is even more down that rabbithole," said Droqen in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/230980/view/506200344140710456">announcement post on Steam</a>. "You can tell from the title, it is about gameplay, it is something. If you want to kill gameplay too or you just want to bathe in the blood of its ending or you just want to watch in horror, maybe this game of a poem will be for you." </p>
<p>We at RPS regularly and viciously kill the <em>word</em> "gameplay" every time it appears, like a relentless weed in our garden of text (I am strongly restraining myself right now). But that's just a word, the visible tuft of a greater problem. The <em>concept</em> of gameplay remains stubborn, its roots spreading deep under the soil of the games industry like a vast and undefinable mycorrhizal network. It is this which Droqen seeks to destroy. This mission is a dangerous folly. I am interested to see how it goes. </p>
<p>"I wanted to release it to as few people as possible," said the dev about the new game, "but then I did that, and then I showed it to a few more people, and then a few more, and I started yelling <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=from%3Adroqen.bsky.social+%22kill+gameplay%22">'kill gameplay'</a> on Bluesky. It got away from me..."</p>
<p>Sounds like one for Edwin, our resident ludopoet. It's also described as an anthology, continuing a long-running trend of indie creators shoving their short works into one compact package. Terry Cavanagh did this recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creator-of-dicey-dungeons-vvvvvv-and-super-hexagon-launches-a-big-freeware-collection">Terry's Other Games</a> and long ago Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thecatamites-commercial-collection-50-short-games">50 Short Games</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, the combined effort of multiple developers. </p>
<p>While Starseed Pilgrim didn't do it for me, it was admired by Adam (RPS in peace) who was at a loss to describe the seed 'em up's appeal in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-starseed-pilgrim">his review</a>. "What to say about a game that would be better passed from hand to hand at bizarre conventions, residing on an unmarked disc with no readme.txt and no explanation?" he said. "I’d gladly forbid people from trying to explain what they’ve experienced to newcomers because the joy is in the discoveries."</p>
<p>The End Of Gameplay will be released on "the full flower moon in May". That's May 12th according to my googling of witchy moon phases. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
