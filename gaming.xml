			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 system software update, released yesterday, introduced a rather major fix alongside the minor enhancements documented in the official update note.</p>
<p>As initially reported on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1l3ane7/it_seems_like_todays_ps5_software_update_fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, and later confirmed by Sony itself to Digital Foundry, the latest system software update fixed a known VRR issue that caused stuttering in games running at 120 Hz with unlocked framerate like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Diablo 4. The stuttering issues would present themselves even in games that do not have 120 Hz modes but take advantage of the system-level feature that works in the 48Hz to 60Hz range, and even in this case, the issues have been reportedly fixed, as Elden Ring no longer starts stuttering after 20 minutes of play like it did before. It's definitely surprising not to see this rather major PlayStation 5 issue getting fixed highlighted in the patch notes, but still, it's very good that Sony finally addressed this issue to offer on its current-generation systems the same smooth VRR experience that has been provided by the Xbox Series systems.</p>

<p lang="en">Sony PR contacted me yesterday to confirm that - as already detected by some - the latest PlayStation firmware resolves the VRR hiccup issue. When I find a spare moment, I'll test it out.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-04-11-40-00/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> did not introduce any major new features to the console, introducing only improvements for messages and usability on some screens. The latest update, which introduced some new features, was released back in April. It reintroduced the PlayStation 30th Anniversary UI and the Audio Focus feature, which allows players to better hear quiet sounds and voice chat in games.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> got a concrete release date at last night's State of Play. You'll be able to play it on PC on September 25 this year, which is also when it arrives on consoles.</p>
<p>As for what you're in for, a fresh trailer made pretty clear that protagonist Hinako Shimizu is going to have a bad time of things, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now">freaky</a> flower monsters and creepy scarecrow-inspired doll things with the mangled posture of your average veteran office worker all seeking to hurt her as she runs around cracking skulls with a pipe.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, things are all fine for Hinako and her mates until a fog decsends on the town of Ebisugaoka, cue a 10/10 creepy laugh and the start of things going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">spookily pear-shaped</a>. Konami producer Motoi Okamoto provided a bit more info in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> released alongside the release date reveal trailer.</p>
<p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town," he wrote, "she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?"</p>
<p>Okamoto cites the game as having "four pillars". These main goals were letting folks explore an "authentic depiction of 1960s Japan", crafting monster design and the soundtrack to focus on the "juxtaposition between beauty and terror", developing puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering", and putting together a "unique" combat system.</p>
<p>"The encounters are as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life," the producer wrote of that last part. "The combat will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>."</p>
<p>The spin-off, penned by Ryukishi07, is designed to work as both an entry point to the series for newbies, and reward veterans with plenty of easter eggs. Last night's showcase also featured the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-is-coming-in-2026-but-once-again-it-looks-like-us-pc-gamers-will-have-to-wait">Nioh 3</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has discussed the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and the developer's continued desire to grow the game from something known primarily as a battle royale into a platform that offers experiences of numerous different genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several years after Fortnite's much-promoted Big Bang event that launched Lego Fortnite, Rock Band developer Harmonix's Festival and Rocket League maker Psyonix's Rocket Racing, Sweeney told IGN at Unreal Fest 2025 that Epic Games' key issue remained the fact that people still think of Fortnite simply as its leading battle royale portion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Progress towards that goal has, so far, been steady. Festival continues to attract big name music acts to headline its seasons with new player skins and music drops. Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a survival crafting experience, has a solid player core. But Rocket Racing has largely been retired, and newer shooter-centric modes such as Reload have found more success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During its State of Unreal show this week, Epic Games noted that a third-party experience in Fortnite had momentarily overtaken Epic's own core modes for the first time, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But Epic Games' own non-shooter modes currently show no signs of replicating this success, with player numbers well below that of the developer's main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists, let alone Reload or the game's Fortnite OG throwback offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked by IGN whether engagement for modes such as the musical Fortnite Festival and various Lego Fortnite experiences were where Epic Games wanted them to be, Epic Games executive vice president Sax Persson replied: "I don't think we're ever happy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the shooter modes have done well," Sweeney added. "I think we've not yet achieved the magic that we've been hoping to achieve with the music gameplay. It's funny, we brought in the Harmonix team, [they] joined Epic, built Rock Band and Guitar Hero in the past, they're an awesome team, and they've been riffing on approaches to that genre and Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They've also been bringing in all kinds of music items into Fortnite with Jam Tracks, which have not only a song, but all the beats associated with them, and ability to play them on your instruments."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite Fortnite's hugely-popular musical live events generating massive interest and player numbers in the millions, Epic has not yet found a formula that generates regular engagement of the same kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," Sweeney noted, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think as Rock Band and Guitar Hero themselves achieved in their day, which was a decade or two decades ago, there's an opportunity for a music game with tens of millions of monthly active users that people just absolutely love and come to every evening or weekend for the coolest concert and competitive gameplay of all sorts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How about Lego, then, the brand that's perhaps now the most deeply entrenched within the Fortnite ecosystem, and the offering that's most popular of all Epic's non-shooter modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Lego is interesting, Persson said. "We are super proud of [the] journey and it has a really dedicated fan base. But is it as big as we would want it to be? No, we would love to have it bigger and figure out a way to get more Lego fans to see that this exists."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Revealed for Nintendo Switch 2 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it sounds like Epic is still facing the issue that Fortnite currently remains a brand associated with being a battle royale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What's our primary challenge? Our primary challenge is Fortnite is Fortnite, and historically Fortnite was a shooter game," Persson continued. "It is not a shooter game anymore. It is the everything game, and we need to tell that story better than what we've done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One solution to this will be the forthcoming rollout of improved capabilities for third-party teams working within Fortnite's Unreal Engine-powered editor, UEFN, Sweeney said. Epic currently has a better toolset than other creators, but this will change over time — to the point that Epic's own battle royale seasons will eventually (now in 2026) be made with the same tools as any creator could have access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we develop our modes, we're working with C++ and the entire Unreal Engine, [while] creators working with the toolset that we built, it's Verse and some APIs," Sweeney noted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our big task now is to get the two of those development frameworks to converge so that we, Epic, and creators are working in the exact same tools with the exact same capabilities and creators will have way more power at their disposal there, and that's been the thing that we've been working so hard on for the last two years."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But why not just settle with being a brilliantly successful battle royale? For Epic Games, the future of Fortnite as a continued experience — and source of enormous income for the company — rests on its continued evolution and ongoing cultural relevance, amid the ever-changing landscape of popular video game tastes and genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem," Sweeney concluded. "If somebody else actually beats us at our game, and builds something that's bigger and cooler and better than battle royale... I think there's a high probability of that happening. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," he added, noting the evolution of shooters from simple games of Deathmatch to modes with larger player counts and vehicles. "Battle Royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented — and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of secret agent James Bond haven't taken long to decide who they think is the (not so) mysterious actor playing the role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's new trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">revealed at Sony's State of Play broadcast</a>, shows off a notably younger-looking Bond, fresh out of the Royal Navy and keen to earn his 00 agent status. But who is playing the title role?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minutes after the trailer aired, fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> began guessing that Dexter: New Blood star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond — and he certainly shares a strong similarity with the character in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I clocked it THE SECOND I saw the dirty smirk of his," wrote one 007 aficionado. "Yeah I peeped that as soon as I seen it," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching the trailer and knew the face looked familiar," said a third. "After about a minute or so I screamed 'DEXTER.' I'm pretty sure it's him."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aged 30, the Irish actor is just a few years older than the 26-year-old version of Bond he looks set to portray in the upcoming game — and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">if IO Interactive gets its way, several sequels</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if Gibson looks familiar to you too, well, the actor already has a swathe of TV and film roles under his belt, including appearances in Shadow and Bone, The Tudors, and The OA. But it's his role as a younger version of Dexter Morgan in prequel series Dexter: Original Sin for which he's most famous.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-632417032-1749114309513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Gibson. Photo by Francois G. Durand/WireImage.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, 007 First Light developer IO Interactive is yet to confirm Gibson itself — though IGN has asked the studio if it can comment on the internet's speculation. Gibson also, for now, appears to keeping schtum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside Gibson's apparent debut in 007 First Light's trailer describes the game as as globe-trotting story-driven action-adventure game where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed Bond cracking a couple of deadpan jokes as he got himself out of (and into) trouble. Gibson's acting chops as the antihero Dexter look set to be put to good use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light is due to launch at some point in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly," Suda51 explained.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened). The final stage of game development is really similar to the world of the movie Beautiful Dreamer, like the night just before a big school festival. Man, it’s been awhile – now I want to watch Beautiful Dreamer again. What, you don’t know that movie...? I guess maybe a lot of you are a bit too young to remember it... It’s probably streaming somewhere, so check it out sometime."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo Is a Dead Man is an "ultra-violent science fiction" action game coming from the collective minds of Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture. Romeo Stargazer — which is one of the best protagonist names I've ever seen, by the way — is an FBI Space-Time special agent searching the universe for the most-wanted fugitives. It's slated for PC via Steam and Microsoft, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, but isn't expected to release until 2026. As for why Grasshopper has given such a vague release window? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it?" Suda51 said, hinting at what can only be in reference to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a>. "That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary.

Both are on Steam Beta first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first update focuses on quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes. The second update will focus on performance. Bethesda said it will share more details “when we are able.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch is much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam. However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged play through, Morgan revealed. And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” Morgan continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Update 1.1., highlights include ToggleHudVisibility and ShowHud console commands, which will be perfect for those looking to capture Oblivion Remastered screenshots (it’s a gorgeous game!), a fix for not automatically showing the Local Map when inside interior spaces and a fix for the Local Map being blank when opening, and a fix for the first-person camera being set above the player's head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

            <p>Everyone, stretch your hamstrings. Leg-having simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> got a release date during last night's PlayStation State of Play. As shown in the trailer below, the game is not so much a "walking sim" as a "walking badly sim".

<p>It's due out September 8th, say the developers. Baby Steps was delayed last year, alongside enough other games to warrant a satirical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">"Best Delayed Games" awards show</a> from publishers Devolver. That's okay, it's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games</a> of this year.</p>
<p>You play as Nate, an "unemployed failson" who is one day magically thrust into the wilderness and must learn to use his actual legs to actually walk on the actual ground. What! I could muse about this being a tale of overcoming learned helplessness, or a story about facing down crippling social anxiety, or a comic commentary on humanity's habit of cognitive offloading - giving all mental effort to machinery. But then, I'd be doing the work for you. Just play the game and analyse it yourself, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>Getting Over It was a silly meditation on difficulty and perseverance disguised as a game that streamers would love because it allowed them to scream a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE6Tr5QUeyI">Matt had a go</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwgeFwH9To">I had a go</a>, and then I gave up because I had other things to do and I hate being bad at things. I did not get over it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/ratatan-the-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-launches-its-first-public-demo-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, I know there’s something going on today with Nintendo, and Switches, and Mario Kart, and a bunch of other things BUT let me direct you to the other most exciting news of the day which is that Ratatan, the spiritual successor to the beloved Patapon series, is launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">its first public demo</a> today, June 5th, at noon BST. Given that the series relies on timing, perhaps they should have picked another day? Still, if you’re not about to fill your house with the noises of blue shells going up plumbers’ bottoms, perhaps you’d like to fill it with the crazy sounds of creatures blowing trumpets to direct their pals to attack giant monsters. Doesn’t that sound good?</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Official Gameplay Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okG0R8r_G8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’ll only sound good if you get the timing right, as Ratatan, like Patapon before it, is a rhythm action game, that has you pressing buttons in time to the music and beat to direct your diminutive army to attack, retreat, defend and run. It sounds simple, and in theory, it is, but as compelling gaming goes, few things have you reaching the same level of zen as Patapon does., If Ratatan can achieve that same trick, we’re in for a treat.</p>
<p>Ratatan pulls in some of that lovely modern roguelike progression, so you can assume that you’ll be levelling up, growing your team’s abilities and adding new troops and weaponry to your army while failing or dying a few times along the way. In fairness, that sounds a lot like the progression from the original Patapon games, but I don’t think I ever thought of them as roguelikes…</p>
<p>The side-scrolling 2D action can be enjoyed by up to four players in co-op, which sounds chaotic. I have little idea how that’s going to work, but the listing for the game says that there can be up to 100 characters on screen, so maybe, you’re just all there?</p>

<p>There’s not long to wait, as you can get ready to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo on Steam</a> now, with a later link coming for Nintendo Switch (and presumably Nintendo Switch 2 as well).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-your-own-personal-rideable-rowboat-mod-sailing-around-cyrodiil-as-magical-mariner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Horses are overrated. Yeah, I said it. No offence to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">any horse experts</a> out there. They’re a bit of an unnecessary purchase in Elder Scrolls games in my experience. </p>
<p>But how else am I supposed to travel? Ah, of course, by boat. I looked at Nexus Mods this morning and spotted that a modder has saved my poor feet by managing to get fully-functional rowboats working in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, so I can sail around Cyrodiil as a magical mariner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4273?tab=description">Row Your Boat</a> does what it says on the tin, provided you count it as 'rowing' if you're doing it via a spell rather than actual manual labour. Drawing inspiration from some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3575">classic</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6690">Oblivion</a> mods, Tyler ‘Dactyl’ Hallada’s created a means to buy a usable rowboat that you can summon and use to sail the waterways of the Imperial province, merrily waving to all the poor landlubbers you pass and praying that you don’t spring a leak.</p>
<p>As you can see demoed in the showcase video below, the boat’s controlled by casting a special row spell while standing up or crouched to move forwards and backwards, with the direction you’re looking acting as the steering. One you’re up to speed, you can also basically set it in cruise control so it’ll keep carving along while your character’s free to take in the scenery and rest their arms.</p>
<figure>

</a>
</p>

<p>Hallada’s implemented stuff like “dynamic collision detection” and “realistic wave simulation” to make things feel more authentically boaty, and added a handy in-game manual in case you get stuck. You can also purchase upgrades for the boat, in the form of a storage chest, working lamp, and a rope ladder to make boarding easier.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the mod’s pretty hardware-intensive right now, with its creator writing: “You may experience some performance impact, especially with a weak CPU. This mod is pushing the limits of the script engine. I’ve spent a lot of time to reduce the performance impact and minimise script execution when the boat is not in use. I personally don’t notice an FPS impact but your mileage may vary.” There's also a list of known issues on the mod page that's worth scanning through.</p>
<p>If you fancy taking to the seas, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p>Not everyone can or wants to jump into a new console on day one, but thankfully the Switch is still home to loads of games and it's doubtful you've played all of them. Our own Christian Donlan reckons you should <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-week-the-switch-2-launches-is-it-too-late-to-buy-one-last-switch-game-not-if-its-burnout">get Burnout Paradise</a> if you're yet to give it a whirl.</p>

      <p>Nintendo has hidden the SD card slot again</p>
    <p>If you know where the SD card slot on the Switch 2 is, this might seem obvious, but trust me when I say we have plenty of data to show that a lot of people couldn't find it on the OG Switch. So, if you are struggling to locate the slot on the Switch 2, it's under the kickstand. More info is in our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-is-the-switch-2-sd-slot">guide on how to locate the Switch 2 SD card slot</a>.</p>

    <p>I am sitting at my desk, twitching like an anxious meerkat because I really, <em>really</em> want my Switch 2 to arrive. One small sound from outside, and I look up and out of the window, hoping it is that glorious DPD van pulling up outside my front door. So far, though, it hasn't been. Boo :( </p>

    <p>Anyone good with screen protector woes? I applied a tempered glass protector, and it seemed to go perfectly, but then this spot never filled in properly. Is this a "get a new protector" situation? Anyone managed to fix this before? You are my only hope Eurogamer readers.</p>

			<p>I never played the original Fantasy Life on the Nintendo 3DS, so I jumped into Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time completely unaware of what I would be signing up for. As my customised character was tossed through a time portal to an ancient island, I gradually found my feet, settling into a quaint life-sim fuelled by a choice from over a dozen job-altering Life selections. This was plenty interesting, but by the time I got used to that loop, I was whisked through another portal and dropped onto an entire other island where the entire ebb and flow of the game completely changed.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time – Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ABhNnsO4Fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a life sim, the game first morphed into a sort of top-down Breath of the Wild style adventure through a massive map full of dungeons and monsters. And then two more times, the game pulls a rug out from under you that you didn’t even realise was there, layering in Animal Crossing style town and home customisation, before also adding a massive helping of roguelite dungeon crawling for good measure.</p>



<p>Many games struggle to make just one of these concepts work as a full experience – but Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time manages to pack all of these together into an endlessly addictive sprawl of life simulation and RPG adventure that is bursting at the seams with exciting stuff to do.</p>

<p>As the dust settles, and you finally get to the core of what Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is, you’re given access to multiple maps that each house various NPCs, bosses, resources, gathering spots, fishing hubs, and more. You’re thrust into a sprawling story of time travel and fantastical adventuring that guides you across these various lands, but I quickly found all my own personal motivations for exploration and adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest of these were my Lives – unique character classes across a spectrum of fighting, crafting, and gathering that let you perform different actions depending on which Life you equip. I started out as a Blacksmith, but soon needed ore to craft a new sword. Swapping to the Miner Life let me gather that ore myself, and once the sword was made, I could become a Paladin and use it to fight off monsters, gathering their parts to use as an Alchemist to brew potions, and on and on down an endless web of activities. Each Life has unique quests, a sprawling skill tree, and special gear to gather.</p>

<p>At times, the grind to advance these Lives or create a particularly rare item can be a little exhausting on your own. As you fight bosses and explore dungeons, though, you’ll rescue characters who can become members of your party and help you fight, gather, fish, and more. I loved this system, but I do wish the companion characters were a bit more interactive. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time skews so far tonally toward Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing that you’d expect to be able to bond with or even romance these characters, but they’re mostly there to act as extra bodies in your quest for experience and items.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time sometimes apes the homework of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild a little too directly, but when you wander into the ever-changing roguelike dungeon, it’s unlike anything else out there. Each room of the dungeon, rather than simply tasking you to fight a daunting boss or horde of enemies, will require you to accomplish various Life-related tasks before your time-limit of exploration hits. One room might trap you in a fishing tug-of-war with a massive underwater beast, while another has you racing to gather every vegetable. There are proper battles mixed in as well, but the way these zones re-contextualise your tranquil Life activities into tense and speedy challenges is such a delight.</p>

<p>I only wish it was more rewarding to experience these delights with friends. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time supports multiplayer, but your activities are limited not just in scope, but in time as well. You aren’t able to fully progress quests together or do anything in your custom settlement besides look around. If you decide to go into the open world together to gather materials and fight bosses, you’re forced to end the session after just 30 minutes. This is a game where co-op progress is constantly gated or held up, making it impossible to lose hours with a loved one the way you can lose that time by yourself.</p>

            <p>If you missed its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/were-finally-getting-our-big-budget-kevin-costners-waterworld-game-in-tides-of-tomorrow">appearance last year</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides Of Tomorrow</a> is a choice-driven adventure game set in a brighter version of Waterworld, and is being made by the team behind road trip adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/road-96">Road 96</a>. Last night it was shown off again during the PlayStation State of Play, and this time the studio has stuck their post-apocalyptic harpoons into a release date. </p>

<p>It's coming out February 24th next year. The ocean-exploring game is set on a flooded earth on which "deadly plastification threatens to kill all living things". It mostly looks like an adventure of gathering resources, meeting strange new folk, and possibly killing them. </p>
<p>The catch is that you're always following in the wake of another player, whose own choices colour how people will react to you. In the trailer above we see Souls-esque phantoms of other adventurers affecting the player's world. They might have taken some loot you wanted, or maybe they threw a dude into the toxic water and now you've got to deal with the poor sick fella afterwards. It's basically a "choices matter" game, but someone else is doing the choosing. That said, other players may also be following you.</p>
<p>"Each person who plays is recorded, their choices are saved, and you can follow them along your journey! A friend? A streamer? The choice is yours!" say developers Digixart. "You will feel the impact from the consequences of the one you follow and must deal with them! It’s up to you to cooperate... or to make some waves!"</p>
<p>Okay, calm down please, marketing copy. No need for all those exclams. Anyway, there were a lot of choices to make in Road 96 too, the previous singleplayer game by Digixart. It was well-liked by Alice B (RPS in peace). "This political road trip is rendered an exciting and entertaining time by its cast and the deliberately piecemeal nature of its storytelling, rather than the story itself," she said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/road-96-review">her review</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sea-of-remnants-is-an-f2p-ocean-adventure-rpg-coming-next-year-to-pc-ps5-and-mobile/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the most interesting surprise announcements from <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play</a> is Sea of Remnants. Developed by Joker Studio, primarily known for the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Identity V, and published by NetEase Games, the game is described as a free-to-play ocean adventure roleplaying game scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Sylar Pan, Product Lead at Joker Studio, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Sea of Remnants places the world’s fate directly in the players’ hands. With more than 300 characters to interact with—whether as allies, enemies, or something in between—every action can trigger surprising and far-reaching consequences. We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Remnants | Anchors Aweigh, Capt'n -  Gameplay Trailer | Get ready for PlayStation!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02YOz0N51ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The premise of Sea of Remnants is quite peculiar. Players will take the role of puppet-looking sailors who have lost all their memories and embark on a journey alongside a mysterious girl across vast seas and uncharted islands to a city slowly awakening to its secrets.</p>
<p>During their travels, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and assemble specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision, whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities, will have dramatic consequences for the world. As rival factions react to each choice and the cityscape of Orbtopia evolves in response, no two captains will experience the same journey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while land combat is turn-based, naval fights take place in real time, with positioning and timing playing a crucial role in the outcome. As mentioned by the developer in the above statement, there will be over 300 non-player characters to interact with, each featuring distinct designs and personalities as well as their own allegiances. Players can befriend, provoke, or remove them. When in Orbtopia, players will even find leisure activities such as mahjong, and life skills such as hotspot cooking and fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> of Sea of Remnants already includes the minimum and recommended requirements.</p>

		<p>We got to get an early start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> last night, booting up our Nintendo Switch 2 and diving into the new generation open world kart racer from the very start.</p>
<p>We’d absolutely recommend watching this on as high a resolution TV or screen as possible, as the stream is available in full 4K to show off the game at its highest fidelity.</p>
<p><iframe title="Watch us play Mario Kart World &amp; Switch 2!" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IVLByZfnbiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We sample a bit of the Grand Prix mode (where I drive really, really poorly), before hopping into a Knockout Tour, some of the open world Free Roam mode, and then wrapped things up just ahead of the PlayStation State of Play stream.</p>
<p>We’ll likely be streaming more of what we’re playing on Nintendo Switch 2 over the coming days on YouTube, so make sure to like, subscribe, click the bell icon and the usual things to get notifications. And obviously keep your eyes peeled for our full reviews of the Switch 2 launch titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play livestream</a>, KONAMI aired a new Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater gameplay trailer. The footage shows off Snake's various stealth and disguise options before moving to more direct fight scenes against a few of the game's bosses. Before the end, the developers also offered a glimpse at the returning Snake vs Monkey minigame, which will be available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Following years of rumors telling of a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, KONAMI finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater in May 2023. This new version is being made with the help of Virtuos, which has also worked with Bethesda on the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</a></p>
<p>Last year, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hasnt-been-messed-with-says-konami-console-graphics-modes-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the narrative would remain exactly the same as in the original. At the same time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the control scheme had to be updated to modern standards.</p>
<p>Players can opt for the newly added, more modern control style. These intuitive controls allow them to focus entirely on the game. Alternatively, it is also possible to stick with the classic control style for those who desire the full-blown nostalgia effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sKMayCD1u3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology, which brings a massive visual improvement over the original game. The developers said that characters are rendered with such detail that you can see facial wrinkles and pores, as well as separate eye and iris movements, allowing for rich and expressive facial animations.</p>
<p>You can also find the PC system requirements below, courtesy of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. The game is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 28</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p>I haven't yet decided whether the loot tortoise in roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dice-legends">Dice Legends</a> looks satisfied or exhausted. Both make sense to me. "He's grown used to this, but still isn't thrilled about it," offered my sister. I would not be thrilled either. Imagine being aware of Pratchett's world turtle and knowing you're a glorified ATM by comparison.</p>
<p>"A roguelike deckbuilder, Nic?", you exclaim with mock interest. "Well, kick me down a well and break out the Vimto we've had mouldering in the cellar since the nineties, the last decade in which anyone consumed or thought about Vimto. Haven't had one of those since the time I went to collect the post forty five seconds ago. Also, the post was two flyers, each advertising a roguelike deckbuilder". I will not argue with your sage industry analysis, friend, although this one does have a couple of notables that may make the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112170/Dice_Legends/">Steam demo</a> an intriguing prospect.</p>

<p>It's got lovely pixel art, for one, although thoughtful art direction isn't too surprising. Dice Legends is the latest project from CD Project alum Rafał Jaki, co-creator of The Witcher 3's Gwent minigame and showrunner on Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>It's also got a tabletop twist on traditional card flinging. Each of the three playable heroes uses a different type of dice (D6, D8, or the haughty D12 - also known in some circles as 'the shape bastard'), and you'll use these to roll a dice pool to activate cards. Some cards need a number within a certain range but will still have the same effect. Others scale up with your dice results. Otherwise, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a> at its very core. Attack, build up shield to defend against telegraphed damage, apply debuffs, and conquer nodes on an overworld map.</p>
<p>Additionally, the soundtrack is pure Bardcore. It is certified <em>jaunty</em> up in here. Is Dice Legends a 'fifth page on the Nintendo Eshop sale'-ass name for a game? Yes. But I think it's good time nonetheless. This one's out in the third quarter of the year, to use the language of my most hated enemies, the year quarterers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Lumines Arise&nbsp;</em>is an all-new puzzler coming later this year</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=eUWLMrvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lumines-arise-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=QCnw9ywE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>game is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, we got a look at a new puzzle game in the&nbsp;<em>Lumines&nbsp;</em>series, which is coming to PS5 later this year (and also to PlayStation VR2, if that matters to ya). It'll pack in 30 stages across a number of new backdrops, plus more of the music you know and love.</p>

<h2>Hey, Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>isn't dead</h2>




<p>Capcom stepped up next to reveal a new trailer for sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>, which has been missing in action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pragmata-thrusts-you-into-strange-new-earth" rel="nofollow">for quite some time</a>, prompting some to believe it was dead. Turns out it isn't, and its rather unique-looking gameplay has you controlling two characters at once. This one launches in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>looks very, very Suda51</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=8X6Wdx6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romeo-is-a-dead-man-playstation-state-of-play-2025.jpg?itok=BvHNR3P1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>is a characteristically Suda51 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture's&nbsp;<em>Romeo Is a Dead Man&nbsp;</em>was next on the slate, and it looks like exactly what you'd expect from a Grasshopper game. It's an action title with exactly the kind of over-the-top aesthetic you've come to love from the studio and its founder, and it's coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>launches on September 25th</h2>

<p>Konami revealed the release date for its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming psychological horror game</a>&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, which will be launching on September 25th. That release date holds true not only for PS5, but also for PC and Xbox, so don't worry if you're not a PS5 owner.</p>

<h2>A new&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>game is coming</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=oyZ4HlOj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=0EFdev1f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement&nbsp;</em>returns to the Metroidvania stylings of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement</em>, was announced for 2026, and unlike the old-school&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoff series, this one's a true blue Metroidvania. You'll be switching between two characters,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin</em>-style, to explore a new castle.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>gets a release date</h2>

<p>If you've been excited to check out the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story&nbsp;</em>series, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>launches on October 3rd, and we got some more info about its story, characters, and customization elements as well.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</em>revives a strategy classic</h2>




<p>In a similar vein to 2022's&nbsp;<em>Tactics Ogre: Reborn</em>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>was announced during the State of Play June 2025 show. It'll boast improved visuals, quality-of-life improvements, and fully voiced dialogue when it launches on September 30th.</p>

<h2>Release date sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Next, we got release dates for some games that have already been revealed. Here's a list of the new release dates we got!</p>

<ul><li><em>Baby Steps&nbsp;</em>(<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow">from Bennett Foddy and Devolver Digital</a>): September 8th</li>
	<li><em>Hirogami&nbsp;</em>(origami platformer from Bandai Namco): September 3rd</li>
	<li><em>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>(golfing sim from Bandai Namco): September 5th</li>
	<li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound&nbsp;</em>(action-packed 2D platformer): July 31st</li>
	<li><em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>(climbing game from the&nbsp;<em>Haven&nbsp;</em>devs): November 5th</li>
</ul><h2><em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection&nbsp;</em>brings retro fighting thrills this year</h2>

<p>Next up, Digital Eclipse revealed&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection</em>, a package containing (or perhaps that should be "kontaining") many old-school&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games. Eight have been announced so far, and more reveals are on the way before release later this year.</p>

<h2>Project Defiant is a wireless fight stick made by Sony</h2>

<p>If you're into your fighting game peripherals, you may want to take a look at Project Defiant, a wireless fight stick created by Sony. It's got the signature PS5 look to it, but built into a classic fighting peripheral design. This one is coming next year.</p>

<h2><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>shows off its boss battles</h2>

<p>Boss battles have always been the cornerstones of a&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>game, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>is no exception. Konami's upcoming remake looks like it'll faithfully recreate Snake's battles against the Cobra Unit when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">arrives in August</a>.</p>

<h2><i>Nioh 3&nbsp;</i>announced for next year, limited-time demo available now</h2>




<p>That's right: there's going to be a new&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>game, and what's more, you can try it out right now.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 next year, offering a choice between two distinct combat styles. A limited-time demo can be downloaded right now on the PlayStation Store.</p>

<h2><em>Thief&nbsp;</em>is back...in VR form</h2>

<p>Next was perhaps one of the cruelest teases of the entire State of Play show. The venerable&nbsp;<em>Thief&nbsp;</em>franchise is back, but&nbsp;<em>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow&nbsp;</em>is, as you've probably come to realize, a VR-exclusive game. It comes to PS VR2 later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is a colorful-looking adventure from the&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>&nbsp;devs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=SziQv_NQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tides-of-tomorrow-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=5OSFFtmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tides of Tomorrow&nbsp;</em>is an asynchronous multiplayer game from&nbsp;<em>Road 96&nbsp;</em>developer DigixArt.</figcaption></figure><p>DigixArt, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Road 96</em>, appeared next to show off&nbsp;<em>Tides of Tomorrow</em>, its colorful adventure with an "intriguing asynchronous multiplayer" element that shows you not only your choices, but a previous player's choices as well. It's coming in February.</p>

<h2><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting new challenge levels</h2>

<p>Team Asobi head Nicolas Doucet took to the virtual stage next to reveal that beloved platformer&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is getting five new challenge levels later this month, and you'll be able to rescue new PlayStation-inspired bots as well.</p>

<h2><em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>is a new pirate RPG coming next year</h2>




<p>If, like many, Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>didn't do anything to quell your desire for pirate adventure,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Remnants&nbsp;</em>could well do the trick. It's a stylized puppetry-inspired pirate RPG coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>is the&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Pathless&nbsp;</em>artist's next adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=bDWQyvox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sword-of-the-sea-playstation-state-of-play-june-2025.jpg?itok=R73wxomm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who's behind this one.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few seconds of the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea&nbsp;</em>pretty much gave away who was behind it. This one comes from Matt Nava, the artist behind&nbsp;<em>Journey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Abzu</em>, and it's coming on August 19th, with a day one PS Plus Extra release lined up.</p>

<h2>More games are heading to PS Plus</h2>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Sword of the Sea</em>, Sony also revealed during the showcase that the PS2 version of classic immersive sim&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex</em>, as well as racers&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, are coming to the Classics Catalog in June and July. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Myst&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Riven</em>, are also coming to the service.</p>

<h2>IO Interactive shows off a little bit of&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></h2>

<p>Next, it was IO Interactive's turn to show off <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>adventure&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em></a>, and it looks...well, like a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, shockingly enough. This one's coming next year, and we'll get more info about it in the coming days.</p>

<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a gameplay deep dive in July</h2>

<p>A very brief clip of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>was shown next, and Sony says a gameplay "deep dive" is coming in July, so we'll get to learn more about the game then. This one is launching in October, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">as previously revealed</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is an anime-inspired fighter coming next year</h2>




<p>Finally, we got a reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, a gorgeous-looking anime fighter from&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>developer Arc System Works. The game will feature Marvel mainstays like Captain America, Spider-Man, and Storm, and it's coming next year.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during this year's Sony State of Play show! Hopefully, we'll be learning more about some of these rather exciting-looking games in the coming months.</p>

What I'm here to discuss is a note left at the end of the announcement by writer Yasumi Matsuno, which reads:</p><blockquote><div><p>Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole. It was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag.</p><p>Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system. It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine.</p><p>And now, in 2025--a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society--I offer this story once again.</p><p>The will to resist is in your hands.</p><p>YASUMI MATSUNO - ORIGINAL SCRIPT, SCENARIO WRITER AND EDITOR</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Hell yeah dude. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

Every decision—whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities—will unleash dramatic ripple effects across the world. With rival factions reacting to each choice and Orbtopia’s cityscape evolving in response, no two captains will share the same story.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
