                <p>Call of Duty: Mobile's latest crossover event is coming soon, and it's not what we expected. The mobile shooter is getting a Nie: Automata crossover beginning May 30, promising a range of themed items based on the franchise for Call of Duty players.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/05/call-of-duty-mobile-season-five-primal-reckoning" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nier crossover</a>, players take control of the YorHa Unit as they fight against Machine Lifeforms, Activision said in the announcement. Players can complete objectives in the game to earn rewards, including the Kui Ji - YoRHa No. 9 Type S operator. Four new NieR-themed melee weapons are included in the crossover event, too, along with the AK-47 Final Apocalypact weapon.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at the Nier crossover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGyui44MEU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YMGyui44MEU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty: Mobile is developed by Tencent's TiMi Studios.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-new-%E2%80%9Chigh-performance%E2%80%9D-mode-delivers-higher-fps-than-performance-mode-with-minimal-impact-on-image-quality.1200594/</guid>

			<p>The custom NVIDIA DLSS 4 "High Performance" mode strikes a good balance between the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, delivering image quality on par with the latter with better performance.</p>
<p>A comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows games like Cyberpunk 2077, Oblivion Remastered, STALKER 2, The Witcher 3 next-gen and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running on an RTX 4070 at 1080p with the official NVIDIA DLSS 4 Performance and Ultra Performance mode and the "High Performance" mode which can be enabled in the NVIDIA App by setting the Ovrerride Super Resolution to 42% input resolution. The custom mode essentially delivers the same image quality as the vanilla Performance mode but with better performance in most of the tested games, and with noticeably better image quality in some games like The Witcher 3 next-gen over Ultra Performance mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 New High Performance Mode - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4070" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8qNaG2ve5Uo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the release of the NVIDIA App earlier this year, it has become possible to tweak NVIDIA DLSS 4 Super Resolution with different input resolutions, giving users more control over how the upscaler behaves. Besides the "High Performance" mode showcased in the video below, the App also allows users to use the Ultra Quality mode that was added to the upscaler a while back but has never been properly implemented, allowing users to enjoy<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-ultra-quality-mode-better-perfromance-image-quality-dlaa/"> better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality.</a></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 officially launched together with the RTX 50 series GPUs, introducing a new Transformer model that delivers better image quality than the old CNN model, Multi Frame Generation for the latest RTX GPU generation and more. More information on these new features can be found <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-set-for-june.1200588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-3-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Forever Entertainment has revealed that mech RPG&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is launching next month, completing the set of remakes for the original PlayStation-era trilogy.</p>

<p>Following on from 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">remake-of-a-remake</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-for-nintendo-switch-delayed-to-q3-2023" rel="nofollow">the following year's</a>&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 2: Remake</em>, the latest entry in the series will be arriving on June 26th, per a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, no Nintendo Switch 2 Edition version of the game has been announced, so it sounds like it won't be getting any Switch 2 enhancements at launch, at the very least. It's entirely possible that's coming in the future, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=Ai3I8Rkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/front-mission-3-remake-release-date-battle.jpg?itok=3GiU7iWC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>is set for release in June.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also no word yet on whether&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>will be coming to other platforms, although given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-1st-remake-steam" rel="nofollow">both of its predecessors</a> were eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/front-mission-2-remake-pc-console-release-date" rel="nofollow">released outside of the Switch ecosystem</a>, it's a distinct possibility.</p>

<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3&nbsp;</em>was the first game in the series to make it outside of Japan, as well as the franchise's final numbered release on the original PlayStation (if we don't count&nbsp;remake&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 1st</em>, which also wasn't released in the West in its PS1 form).</p>

<p><em>Front Mission 3</em>'s plot revolves around pilots Kazuki Takemura and Ryogo Kusama, who are caught up in one of the&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>series' signature political conflicts. As tensions rise and military zones become more "volatile", Kazuki and Ryogo must pilot their "wanzer" mechs to survive.</p>

<p>Just as with previous&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>remakes, you can expect this one to come complete with a number of improvements, including sharper visuals, smoother performance, and gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Forever Entertainment intends to continue remaking&nbsp;<em>Front Mission&nbsp;</em>games; if so, the next logical candidate in the string would be 2003's&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 4</em>, the first series entry on the PlayStation 2.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Front Mission 3: Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for Nintendo Switch on June 26th. It will likely also be playable on Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While “auteurism” can sometimes feel like a pretentious label, there’s a real thrill in watching a creator unapologetically pour their tastes into their work. Doubly so if it’s some freaky shit. Mangaka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paru_Itagaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paru Itagaki</a>’s new ghost cuckold manga proves that she knows how to let her freak flag fly without getting lost in the weeds of her kinky illustrations.</p><p>Paru Itagaki may be the daughter of <a href="https://kotaku.com/baki-hanma-netflix-yujiro-obama-che-guevara-anime-1850741340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Baki the Grappler</em></a>’s<em> </em>Keisuke Itagaki, but her true claim to fame has nothing to do with her nepo baby status — it’s being the genius behind <a href="https://gizmodo.com/beastars-caps-off-netflixs-fall-anime-season-in-spectacular-fashion-2000535938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beastars</em></a> (AKA <a href="https://aftermath.site/zootopia-2-fan-comic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSFW <em>Zootopia</em></a>). At its core, <em>Beastars </em>is a bold exploration of class divides between carnivores and herbivores, gang violence, and the budding romance between a meek teenage wolf named Legoshi and a promiscuous white rabbit, Haru. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(animation_studio)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studio Orange</a>’s anime adaptation of <em>Beastars </em>first released on Netflix in 2020, it sparked a phenomenon in the anime community: much like people who hesitantly recommend <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> with warnings, <em>Beastars</em>' problem was that it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsBHll5wPg8&amp;list=PL792J1gNAYrQSZZKrlBbmjzZl3IZ-oxLm&amp;index=24&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too hot and uncomfortable to handle</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Watch/read <em>Beastars</em>, cowards&nbsp;</h2><p>In the climax of its second episode, <em>Beastars </em>confronted viewers with its stark approach to depicting sexuality, with Haru mistakenly assuming Legoshi meeting her in the shed on the roof of their campus was for sex. For many, this was an instant vibe check, sending the “I’m not a furry, bro” crowd for the hills and dismissing the show as the “furry porn fanservice” show. Like the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/never-give-up-digging-for-diamonds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digging for Diamonds meme</a>, folks quit too early, like cowards, before <em>Beastars </em>started cooking a deeply considered narrative about how the pair’s evolving relationship with sex, the implicit power dynamics between their species, and the broader taboo of interspecies romance reflected the sociological failings of their conservative society. By the final season, the series cemented itself as a provocative, well-crafted examination of these themes, proving there was far more at play than hetero (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULseevtGZH8&amp;list=PL792J1gNAYrQSZZKrlBbmjzZl3IZ-oxLm&amp;index=30&amp;pp=iAQB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and homoerotic</a>) anthropomorphic animals giving each other “come fuck me” eyes.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hal &amp; Legoshi: Will They or Won't They?

She’s <a href="https://x.com/itaparu99/status/1794693889082962378/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funny on social media</a>, has an <a href="https://x.com/itaparu99/status/1772585923462521257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-timer mangaka disguise</a>, and knows how to tackle big ideas without letting spicy stuff overpower themes. With <em>Ushimitsu Gao</em>, she’s leaning into the sexy stuff that scared the hoes with <em>Beastars</em>, writing a horror romance manga that’s equal parts sensual, thought-provoking, and most importantly, a mesmerizing read.</p><h2><em>Ushimitsu Gao</em> is Itagaki in her freaky Kate Chopin bag</h2><p><a href="https://championcross.jp/series/5371e74139496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ushimitsu Gao</em></a> (<em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em>) centers on Megumi Sano, a young housewife who’s always had a knack for seeing spirits. No matter where she goes, girly be seeing ghosts. Her unconventional trick to send them on their merry way is doing something lewd or obscene, because ghosts “dislike erotic stuff” — a fact I can’t help but think is a subliminal diss at folks who wrote off <em>Beastars</em>’ eroticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One night, while she and her exhausted salaryman husband, Yuji, are trying to conceive — an activity she describes as an unenthusiastic endeavor devoid of passion and climaxes for both parties — she spots a tall ghost Blair Witching in the corner of their bedroom while they make the beast with two backs. If the above sentence sounds like the most cursed thing you've read, that's because it is, and that's a part of the charm.</p><p>If you thought the premise would play out in a storyline where the ghost sits in the corner watching Megumi and Yuji make love, you’d be wrong. Yuji gets put in the proverbial accent chair, when Megumi’s efforts to have such fantastic sex with Yuji that it helps the dullahan pass on to the afterlife (or to exorcise him with salt) lead her to discover it's the unliving entity that’s turning her on. Her sensitivity to ghosts allows her to feel it place its salt-covered hand, too powerful to be exorcised, on her lips, and she responds in kind by sucking on his thumb. One morning, she even wakes up to Kinbaku rope marks on her skin after her resident ghost visits her in the night.</p><p>Megumi gives her paranormal service top a nickname, Ghost-kun, or Gou-kun (she almost nicknames him Yuurie or Yuu-san until she thinks better of it, as it sounds too close to her husband’s pet name, Yuu-kun) leaves spider lilies out for him, and covers her bedroom window with cardboard so they can get down during the day while her hubby is away, on top of the two having sex every night while her husband, who doesn’t believe in the paranormal, sleeps with his back to them getting it on.&nbsp;</p><p>Undoubtedly, this manga is freaky, and Itagaki is a real one. I kid you not, the moment Gou-kun's head fell off mid-sex, I joked to myself about how funny it would be if the manga made a joke about giving head. Itagaki immediately called my jest in a time-skip page-turn where Megumi casually mentioned her go-to kink request was for Gou-kun to do precisely that, while the rest of his body caresses her. The manga might only be a year old, but I spent a short evening getting caught up on it over the weekend, and I’m sat for more.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned up top, <em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em> isn’t just a smutty NTR manga. It also examines the unhealthy nature of the love triangle’s arrangement for all parties involved. Despite Megumi rightfully shaming a friend’s insistence that her affair is saving her marriage with an analogy about cheating wives that, like the hirugao flower, “come in bloom during the day, when the husband is away,” it later becomes the bedrock of her infidelity. To Megumi, her shacking up with Gou-kun is safe from scrutiny because he, in the technical sense, isn’t real. However, there are consequences to her affair: Every time they make love, Gou-kun is sapping the vitality out of Megumi, growing more handsome and less macabre (save for his protruding, Mileena-esque teeth poking out of his cheeks). To everyone else, her post-sex glow is her becoming more gaunt. Instead of taking that as a sign to stop cheating on her husband with a ghost, she takes it as a sign to eat more so she’ll have more energy left after their entanglement. The manga also doesn’t mince words by presenting their supernatural situation as anything other than Megumi cheating on Yuji.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned above, the story is more than just the sensationalism of its premise; it is brutally honest in its discussions about consent and includes a couple of chapters on certain reliable manga reading sites that provide content warnings. It doubles down by making matters all the more stark when body-snatching, signaled by Gou-kun code word “I will curse you,” comes into play. And Gou-kun is still being a homewrecker, declaring that Yuji and Megumi’s love is a thing of the past and that Yuji is neglecting Megumi’s feelings. While there’s some truth worth exploring in Gou-kun’s second point, the manga is also signaling that their outs are the awkward aftershock of the married couple being out of their honeymoon period.</p><p>Itagaki’s unflinching storytelling in both <em>Beastars </em>and <em>Her Face at the Witching Hour</em> is a rare fascination in the world of manga, where sexuality is often boxed into empty fan service or sanitized detachment. She refuses to be confined by those limitations, instead opting to employ horror, romance, and infidelity as rich narrative tools for exploring the tangled realities of self-discovery and desire.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s almost a <em>The Awakening</em>-style unraveling in Megumi’s journey where her pursuit of sexual liberation sends her soaring, only for the reentry flames of consequence to send her careening back down to earth. It’s exciting to see a creator evoke Kate Chopin vibes while writing about ghost cuckoldry. But good art strives to craft a compelling narrative that challenges, unsettles, and excites in equal measure. I think Itagaki is a creative deep in her bag.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam"><h3>9 Kings: It’s A Good Video Game</h3></a><p>Play some cards, slaughter some guys</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The app will apparently feature achievements, leaderboards, and social features. Additionally, the Mac version supposedly will include games bought and downloaded from other storefronts. Rumblings of a dedicated gaming app first appeared late last year at <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/" rel="nofollow ">9to5Mac</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">That's not all from Apple on the gaming front, either. Earlier this week, the company acquired Sneaky Sasquatch maker RAC7, per <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="nofollow ">Digital Trends</a>. The purchase of the two-person studio is reportedly the first time Apple has ever bought a gaming developer. Sneaky Sasquatch is one of the most popular games on the subscription service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/#1">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The dedicated gaming app also comes almost five years after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-fortnite-ban-and-apple-google-legal-battle-explained/1100-6480913/">Fortnite maker Epic took Apple (and Google) to court</a> over App Store policies that didn't allow for companies to get direct payment from users. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/">Fortnite finally returned to iOS</a> in the US just over a week ago after almost a half-decade off the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple has also spent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-ambitions/1100-6525131/">touting its gaming pedigree</a>, even stating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-15-pro-is-best-game-console-apple-says/1100-6517793/">the iPhone 15 Pro was going to be the best gaming console</a> in 2023.

                <p>Video game retailer GameStop is a big believer in Bitcoin. The Grapevine, Texas-based company disclosed today, May 28, that it had purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. At the current trading rates, that's worth more than $510 million USD.</p><p>Bitcoin is one of the world's most valuable, and volatile, assets. It's currently <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">worth more than $2 trillion overall</a>, which is ahead of the total market cap of Google's parent company Alphabet. The current price for one Bitcoin is about $108,000.</p><p>GameStop's press release announcing the purchase of Bitcoin is <a href="https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-details/2025/GameStop-Announces-Purchase-of-Bitcoin/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a single sentence long</a>, and there is no word on why GameStop did this or what its plans are. The announcement was not a surprise, though, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/gamestop-is-considering-investing-in-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-sources-say.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported in February</a> that GameStop was planning to buy cryptocurrencies. On May 27, US President Donald Trump <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-bitcoin-stock-sale-c2db8214871452b88950bc10b567d1ec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated his desire to create a "Bitcoin treasury."</a></p><p>In any event, GameStop's share price is up around 10% so far in 2025 and up more than 3,000% since the short-squeeze situation of 2021. GameStop had cash reserves of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/28/gamestop-shares-rise-as-retailer-meme-stock-buys-first-bitcoin-batch-scooping-up-500-million.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $4.5 billion as of February 2025</a>, according to the company's latest filings.</p><p>Buying Bitcoin is GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen's latest strategy to help the struggling company turn things around; other measures have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-makes-a-surprise-profit-warns-of-impending-store-closures/1100-6526415/" data-ref-id="1100-6526415">layoffs, store closures, and selling Game Informer.</a></p><p>Cohen has the power to do this in part because GameStop's board voted in December 2023 to allow Cohen and two other board members to use GameStop's cash pile to purchase securities as part of a new <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20250404496/gamestops-stock-is-climbing-again-this-is-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"investment policy."</a></p><p>GameStop previously invested in NFTs and created its own cryptocurrency wallet, but the company shuttered this in January 2024.</p>

After ambling through a brief demo that showcased the upcoming sojourn in all of its whimsical, offbeat glory, I parked myself next to Takahashi to learn more about his process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before I could fire up the recording app on my iPhone, however, Takahashi asked whether he might inspect the handset. The device, what I assumed was a run-of-the-mill iPhone 15 with a yellow colorway, piqued his interest because of its apparently ambiguous hue. We spent the next few minutes debating what constituted 'yellow' and whether this particular morsel of technology was in fact more of a 'banana' shade. We eventually agreed on the latter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was a small exchange that quickly told me two things: this would not be a straightforward interview, and this is a person who—despite spending decades making video games—remains unapologetically curious. Over the next 25 minutes we spoke at length about everything from production processes to the need for a creative revolution in the niche field of playground design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dredge-wasn-t-originally-going-to-be-a-narrative-game-but-then-it-became-one-of-2023-s-best" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dredge wasn't originally going to be a narrative game, but then it became one of 2023's best</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here's everything I learned during that wonderfully winding conversation.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="To a T wasn't immune to scoping issues">To a T wasn't immune to scoping issues</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Takahashi tells me the idea for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To a T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which tells the story of a 'Teen' stuck in a T-pose who must attempt to navigate life in a small town with the help of a fluffy companion, came to him fairly quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, it took longer than expected to turn the concept into something viable. He explains the development team (Takahashi now works at a studio called Uvula) initially thought they could finish </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>To a T</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in around two years. In the end, the project was in the oven for five.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although production took longer than anticipated, the nucleus remained unchanged. "It's sort of a sitcom," explains Takahashi, who says he storyboarded the beginning of the game in order to consolidate and communicate his vision for the project. Following our chat, Takahashi sent over some of those storyboards, which you can see below.</span></p><p>To a T storyboards via Keita Takahashi</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">12 people worked on the title when production was in full swing, but the size of the team fluctuated over the years. It was important, says Takahashi, to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses during that time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, he explains they generally tried to avoid incorporating physics because they can be "so tough and difficult."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-star-wars-outlaws-poker-style-mini-game-helped-to-define-its-tone" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Star Wars Outlaws' poker-style mini-game helped to define its tone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just use physics for the VFX and stuff like that," he says. He notes the narrative has always been the glue that binds the experience together. "I thought of the story and then tried to think about what kind of mini-games would fit," he continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those mini-games will see players attempt to help Teen brush their teeth, choose their outfit, and chomp down some cereal to understand how seemingly mundane actions can become notable hurdles when you exist outside the perceived norms of society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all of its whimsy and barmy charm, the demo was also a sensitive and affecting look at what life is like when the "little things" are hard and what it means to be the "perfect shape."

Tremendous.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Being a game developer is so risky&quot;">"Being a game developer is so risky"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As our conversation turns to how the industry at large has changed over the past five years—with a short-lived COVID-19 boom and subsequent over-investment eventually leading to mass layoffs, studio closures, and debilitating funding challenges—I ask Takahashi what he gleaned during that time and whether he has any advice for developers looking to bring their own unique vision to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, he's reluctant to whisper any sage words. "I'm still too young to offer wisdom," he says. The fear is that he might unintentionally offer bad advice. "I'm the worst, dude," he continues, with a laugh.

		<p>Redemption Road’s barmy time-travelling medieval war game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingmakers">Kingmakers</a> is set to hit Steam Early Access on 8th October 2025. Check out the new trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, uh, what’s going on there, then? Well, the future is about to crumble into an apocalypse, but there’s thankfully a chance to set things right by bouncing back in time 500 years and turning the tide of a brutal medieval war in England. You’ve got to change history, and since the chances of a time traveller just dying from stepping on a rusty nail and not having a tetanus shot are pretty much astronomical, you need to stack the odds in your favour by bringing some modern day toys with you.</p>
<p>Yup, that means running around with fully automatic assault rifles, RPGs, hopping onto motorbikes and into tanks that can just drive through stuff. With all of this at hand, you have a much better chance, but one man with a machine gun isn’t going to survive an enemy army, even if they are running at you with swords. So you can build cities and castles, recruit soldiers to your cause and raise armies to conquer the rest of the country, blending in RTS action with the third person battling.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can bring some friends with you too with support for up to 4 player co-op.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/everything-announced-during-day-of-the-devs-tga-2024-edition/">announced back at Day of the Devs last June</a>, Kingmakers was then expected for a Q1 2025 early access release, but has naturally slipped back a fair bit to October. There’s real potential here to be that silly online co-op hit, though, so hopefully it arrives in good shape.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[MindsEye gets an explainer trailer, just two weeks before launch]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/mindseye-gets-an-explainer-trailer-just-two-weeks-before-launch/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/mindseye-gets-an-explainer-trailer-just-two-weeks-before-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Build A Rocket Boy and IOI Partners have released a big new explainer trailer for MindsEye, their ambitious open world shooter and user-generated content <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/mindseye-is-launching-in-everywhere-but-what-does-that-mean/">Everywhere</a> platform that is set to launch on 10th June for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story of MindsEye takes place in Redrock City, a near future metropolis in which humans and machines battle for power and control, which is shown through the power struggle between Mayor Shiva Vega and tech genius Marco Silva, who is also the founder of the technology firm Silva Industries. Shiva wants to make Redrock City the safest place on the planet, but through controlling the population, while Silva wants to use technology to alter humanity. Caught between all of this is main character Jacob Diaz, who is a on a mission to figure out his own past.</p>
<p>The trailer shows off plenty of cinematics from the story, missions that even take you up to space, and a whole bunch of third person shooter combat. In these segments, you’ll have plenty of conventional guns to choose from, but also have an AI drone buddy that can do area recon and stun enemies, hack evil I, Robot movie robots to fight alongside you and more.</p>
<p>It’s brought together by in-game “portals” branded Play.Mindseye to access moments from the official story and the open world, as well as hop into the “infinite entertainment” of user-generated missions through the PC-based Build.Mindseye tools. It’s a full-blown level and mission editor, providing the platform for people to make their own games. This is a part of the Everywhere platform, as mentioned above, a counterpart and rival to Fortnite’s UGC tools, and more presciently, to GTA 5 and the upcoming GTA 6.</p>

<p>At launch the game will have the single player content in free roam, as well as separate races, checkpoint races, and drone races. This will expand through content updates to add more missions, multiplayer (in the autumn), community updates and “special collaborations”. More will be added for those buying the premium edition of the game.</p>

<p>For such an ambitious title, it’s perhaps surprising that the marketing hasn’t been more intense. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">first revealed in February</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/mindseye-release-date-set-for-june-10th/">release date was only announced in March</a>, but this production is clearly setting its sights on Grand Theft Auto Online’s audience. That’s hardly surprisingly when the team was founded by Leslie Benzies, formerly of Rockstar and producer on pretty much everything from GTA 3 through to GTA 5.</p>
<p>The run up to launch has also been quite restrained in terms of only granting preview to a select few YouTubers, from what we can see, and with no coverage from major gaming sites. Impressions were… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">less</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKKAMa6sXxE">than</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhWeYRoZl4E">favourable</a>. These previews were live, but remote and hands off, limiting the potential for appraisal.</p>
<p>So, uh… yeah, 10th June’s going to be interesting and we’re keen to go hands on for ourselves.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Elden Ring Nightreign</h5><p><span>May 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>The announcement of Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">last year</a> was a surprise for most players. Following the release of what has become FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">most celebrated action RPG</a> to date and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">expansion</a>, it has been reiterated multiple times that <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-2-development/">a sequel</a> was not in development, suggesting that it would be a while until Tarnished could return to the Lands Between, counting teased IP expansions that most thought were a few years away. The doors of the Roundtable Hold, however, could not stay shut for long, and the iconic location is about to be opened up to welcome the Nighfarers and aid them in their difficult battle against the Nightlords to repel the Night Tide and possibly restore the fractured reality of Limveld to the former splendor of its older days.</p>
<p>While every entry in the Souls series featured a multiplayer component, the co-op nature of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, and its extremely close resemblance to the original game, made more than a few players skeptical at the game's reveal. FromSoftware's games are known for their relatively slow pace that allows players to meticulously explore big, intricately designed locations, study enemy patterns, and develop their character build to be able to overcome the many challenges they have to face. I shared this skepticism myself.</p>
<p>While I could see the gameplay formula lend itself to a roguelike spin, the focus on co-op felt, on paper, maybe a little forced, considering the studio never implemented proper co-op in their games, allowing it only for short segments. Playing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/">Closed Network Test</a>, my opinion of the game changed for the better, and spending 30+ hours with the launch version made me realize how wrong I was. Though some things could be improved, Elden Ring Nightreign shows once again why FromSoftware is the best at what they do, tweaking their formula slightly to make it work as an engaging high-speed co-op experience where individual player knowledge and skill still matter a lot.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520000241_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though Limveld looks very similar to The Lands Between's Limgrave region, Elden Ring Nightreign's setting is very different from that of the base game. This new region is a parallel version of Limgrave, created after the cataclysmic event called the Shattering. Being a fractured version of the first regions players explore in Elden Ring isn't the only thing that makes Limveld dangerous, as the Night Tide besieges the land, reshaping it each night ahead of the coming of the Nightlord, a being linked with the ancient Nox civilization, who were known worshippers of the night even after they were forced into exile in The Lands Between. The only warriors capable of surviving the Night Tide and taking on the Nightlord and its hordes are the Nightfarers. Defined by their combat abilities, but with their own personal stories and motivations, the eight warriors - Wylder, Guardian, Duchess, Ironeye, Raider, Recluse, Revenant and Executor - often embark on Expeditions in Limveld from the Roundtable Hold base to fight off these hordes, defeat the powerful Nightlords, and discover the truth behind the mysterious being behind it all.</p>
<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, Elden Ring Nightreign features plenty of story, but it's up to players to put the pieces together. Instead of featuring the same envrionmental storytelling of every Souls game, which would have been difficult to implement in a fast paced game like this, the game's story is developed using character profiles that are accessed in the Roundtable Hold, as well as with Nightfarers' individual quests part of the Remembrance mechanics that require players to complete certain tasks while on an Expedition. New story elements are introduced and developed after a few Expeditions, in the vein of story-heavy roguelikes like Hades or Returnal, so even a failed Expedition rewards players for their effort beyond giving them Relics and Murk, central elements of the permanent progression system featured in the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250525181707_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the surface, Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't feel any different from the base game, only featuring a considerably smaller but denser map filled with locations to explore, which hide all sorts of enemies but also weapons and upgrades. It also plays almost exactly like it, down to the weapon's moveset and balance, reminiscent of the first few versions of the game. If one were to pick the Wylder, for example, there almost wouldn't be any difference from playing any player-created character from the original game, and, as such, the game can instantly feel familiar to those who have already spent time in The Lands Between. Everything else surrounding the most basic Elden Ring mechanics, however, is completely different. As the land of Limveld is besieged by the Nightlords, which, unsurprisingly, only come out at night, there's a time limit for exploring Limveld. Each game consists of three days, the first two lasting around 15 minutes, and the final comprising only the boss fight against one of the seven Nightlords. As time passes, the Night approaches, and the playable area becomes smaller in the first two days, eventually forcing the Nightfarers to convene in a certain spot on the map to take on a powerful boss, often a familiar face lifted straight from Elden Ring or the Dark Souls games. Defeating any boss in Limveld will reward Nightfarers with more runes needed to level up and one of three passive upgrades to help them better define the builds they have started putting together on the fly during the current Expedition.</p>
<p>Doing things as quickly as possible is the name of the game in Elden Ring Nightreign. With the Night constantly threatening to engulf certain parts of Limveld, Nightfares have to come up with a plan rather quickly, prioritizing where to go and which upgrades to get depending on the their position, the areas that will potentially become inaccessible as the Night Tide closes in, and the affinity of the Nightlord they are hunting. As the position of almost every location on the map is randomized at the start of an Expedition, knowing the layout of the map will not, by itself, be enough to level up, enhance the more than important than ever Flask with additional charges, and upgrade characters enough to survive the Night. After defeating the first Nightlord, Gladius, Shifting Earth events will be unlocked, special events that significantly alter the basic Limveld map to provide some welcome variety, and with World Events and Raids thrown in randomly, which can even cause Nightlords to appear before Day 3, Nightfarers can never rest easy.</p>
<p>With no time to waste, it's not surprising to see how character progression in Elden Ring Nightreign has been considerably streamlined, as, upon level up, stats are upgraded automatically depending on the Nightfarer. This doesn't mean that the immense number of character build options available in the original game are gone. The contrary, actually: there are so many options that everything feels almost overwhelming during the first couple of Expeditions. Every weapon in the game, which can be obtained by opening up treasure chests, raiding enemy camps, and defeating bosses, comes in different rarity levels and with different passive skills, the vast majority of which are active just by having the weapon in your inventory.</p>
<p>These passive skills empower all sorts of builds, allowing players to recreate the devastating bleed builds seen in Elden Ring's first few versions, elemental builds, tanky builds with increased poise and damage negation, critical hit builds that work great with characters that have an easy time opening enemies to them, like the parry-focused Executor, and so on. Further defining builds are the Relics, special items representing the game's permanent progression system, coming with passive skills that can be equipped to any character before the start of any Expedition, which can make a huge difference in a variety of situations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250526003628_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Adding more depth to the experience are the eight Nightfarers, who all play very differently from one another. The already mentioned Wylder is the most balanced of them, offering a balanced mix between offense and defense that can work in every situation, but every other Nightfarer is more specialized, offering a different gameplay style, such as the ranged-focused playstyle of Ironeye, the traditional tank with great supportive skills like Guardian, the magic oriented Recluse, the frontline fighter Raider, the quick Duchess, the spirit summoner Revenant and the parry-focused Executor. Each character's uniqueness is well-defined not only by the ability to use certain weapons effectively with enhanced movesets, but also by their unique Passive Ability, Character Skill, and Ultimate Art, which generally have a few uses besides damaging an enemy.</p>
<p>For example, the Ironeyes' Single Shot Ultimate Art can knock down the vast majority of foes and quickly revive downed companions, who usually have to be hit multiple times with regular attacks to return to life. After playing Elden Ring for hundreds of hours, this character system feels a little off, but thankfully it doesn't take a long time for it to shine, as it makes a lot of sense given the game's co-op focus, which is the feature that mostly defines the entire experience, and, most of all, makes it a ton of fun.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign can be either played solo or with two other players, but it's clear how the experience has been designed for co-op first and foremost. Elements like the time limit, the huge enemy numbers, which comprise the vast majority of enemies seen in Elden Ring, and their high HP values clearly indicate how Elden Ring Nightreign has to be played with friends. In solo mode, only the HP values are tweaked, so having to deal with a huge number of enemies is a challenge that only the best will be able to overcome. In the thirty-plus hours I spent with the game, I only managed to get to the Nightlord fight a handful of times playing solo, and most of the time, it was more frustrating than fun. Playing with others, no matter their knowledge of the game's mechanics, on the other hand, was always tons of fun.</p>
<p>While using voice chat to communicate and set up strategies consistently led to the most victories, even just using the in-game pin system, which allows players to indicate where they want to go to the other Nightfarers on the map, works reasonably well, and is a completely viable way of handling the war against the Night and its hordes. With other players by your side, the culmination of each Expedition, the fight against one of the Nightlords, becomes even more epic and memorable. It also helps that these bosses are among the best FromSoftware has designed to date. Each Nightlord has a distinct combat design that makes fighting them a joy, although they can be quite challenging, with unrelenting movesets that leave very few openings. For some, this will be a frustrating issue, but for others, their incredible power will only make the fights more epic, coupled with the fantastic soundtrack.</p>
<p>With online co-op being the focus of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign provides players with plenty of options to enjoy the game with others. Besides allowing regular matchmaking, the game also offers the chance to put together squads by inviting users from the friend list or setting up passwords to join a game. The password system can also be used to allow a certain number of users to more frequently encounter the remnants of their defeated friends, giving them the chance to obtain their dropped equipment or see the manner of their defeat. Unfortunately, the game does not feature cross-platform play, which feels like a baffling omission. The lack of duos matchmaking also feels like an oversight, which is probably justified by balancing reasons, as it would really take too long to take down the Nightlords with just two players with the current HP values, although the developer is thinking about implementing a two-player mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">down the line.</a></p>

<p>Using a good portion of the assets seen in the original game, Elden Ring Nightreign doesn't look much different from the 2022 Game of the Year, although visuals have been clearly touched up slightly, and present a high level of polish with little to no visual glitches and some beautiful skyboxes that well deliver the oppressive atmosphere of Limveld and the impending arrival of the Night. Character models are also, for the most part, lifted from Elden Ring and from the Dark Souls games, but those that aren't, like the models for new bosses, look great and contribute to better separating the co-op game from its predecessor and to making it more engaging.</p>

<p>Speaking specifically about the PC version of the game, in proper FromSoftware fashion, the game has a 60 FPS cap, so a high refresh rate experience is not possible, at least at launch. Though the game comes with a limited selection of graphics settings to tweak, and doesn't support any major upscaler (NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS), Elden Ring Nightreign seems to fare much better than the original Elden Ring in terms of performance. In a benchmark session comprising two in-game days on the base Limveld map without any Shifting Earth events, the game ran at 4K resolution, max settings an average of 59 FPS, 45 FPS 1% low on my machine (I7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), with no major stuttering, so the slight drops weren't an issue whatsoever. In addition, online play works great in all manner of situations and with all sorts of connections. Due to an issue with my internet connection, I temporarily could only play the game online via a mobile hotspot, and experienced no trouble whatsoever matchmaking with other players and enjoying full sessions, so, if the servers manage to keep up with the expected influx of players in its launch window, I expect online play to perform great for the vast majority of players.</p>

<p data-start="211" data-end="684">Elden Ring: Nightreign, more than many other FromSoftware titles, is likely to be an acquired taste for most players. My first few Expeditions into Limveld weren't particularly enjoyable, but the more I learned its mechanics, and the less I expected a traditional Soulslike with some roguelike elements sprinkled in, the more the game grew on me. Now, after dozens of failed Expeditions and a handful of successful ones spread over 30+ hours, I find it hard to put down. With its wealth of character customization options and the tension of a ticking clock dictating the fast pace of the experience, Elden Ring Nightreign is an engaging and exhilarating experience that even those with only a passing interest in FromSoftware's games, or those still skeptical about it, should give a chance. Like me, they may find themselves drawn to the Night so deeply that they may never want to leave.</p>

Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Magic Pot</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=itbIBPqb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/-techraptor-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-magic-pot.jpg?itok=MdkTo3Dq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That's right! We're so lucky to share the exclusive premiere of everyone's favorite recurring enemy: Magic Pot! This 3 mana 1/4 isn't just a decent blocker - it's also a great way to deal with cards causing trouble in your opponents' yards! And the fact that it dies and leaves behind a treasure token is a nice little bonus.</p>

<p>Now let's move onto the big guy, the crystal hunter himself:</p>

<h2>MTG Final Fantasy - Golbez, Crystal Collector</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=IivZOyzj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-exclusive-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-golbez.jpg?itok=X_OVuNKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We're so excited to premiere exclusive to TechRaptor&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s number 2 baddie, Golbez! Known as the mysterious Man in Black in the original&nbsp;<em>FFIV</em>&nbsp;game, he later becomes a playable character in&nbsp;FFIV: The After Years. Zealous in his pursuit of Crystals!</p>

<p>That's matched perfectly with the flavor of this card, as Golbez, Crystal Collector cares about being surrounded by Artifacts! I've got plans already brewing to put together a Commander deck around Golbez, Crystal Collector, filling up my board with treasure and food token generation via cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/137/nuka-cola-vending-machine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuka-Cola Vending Machine</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=671622" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Academy Manufactor</a>, <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=598195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Currency Converter</a>, and more! Add in discard outlets like big creatures with Cycling (which you can grab back), Golbez, Crystal Collector's own Surveil ability, and old classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5113" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bottomless Pit</a>, and we've got a nasty little engine here!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night.1200531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is not&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>. I know&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is right there in the title, but trust me when I say that if you approach this one like it's just another&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>-style expansion, you're going to be either baffled or disappointed.</p>

<p>If you want to have a good time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's best to think of it not as a Soulslike but as a multiplayer experiment in the genre. Happily, a good time is very much there to be had, although it's not without its caveats.</p>

<p>What begins as a slightly janky-feeling, strangely "off" version of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">megahit base game</a> slowly opens up and reveals its addictive core concepts over time.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>embarks on its own journey, and while it wears the (god)skin of its larger cousin, it's a unique, compelling beast in its own right.</p>

<h2>Just What the Heck Is&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-grafted-scion.jpg?itok=5VCJTeuL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-grafted-scion.jpg?itok=ViGgJkQU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a very different beast to its forebear.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>offers a hyper-condensed, frantic version of the standard&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>exploration-combat loop. Each run takes place over three days; on the first two, you'll be exploring as many locations as possible to scavenge for weapons and supplies, all while defeating some very familiar-looking minibosses.</p>

<p>The third day sees you and your buddies (or just you, if you're a masochist) taking on a Nightlord, one of the new bosses created solely for&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>. They're formidable foes that will require exactly the same careful approach and tactical understanding you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>encounter.</p>

<p>It's a system that takes some getting used to. As a player who likes to take their time and explore every nook and cranny of FromSoftware's beautifully crafted locations,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s breakneck speed alienated me at first. Over time, however, I managed to attune to its uptempo polyrhythms.</p>

<p>This is also very much a game designed around its co-op component. While&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>does support solo play, I wouldn't recommend it; the solo runs I tried were fairly miserable, and publisher Bandai Namco has also made it clear this is an experience intended for three players.</p>

<p>Assuming you can assemble a squad, then,&nbsp;<i>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</i>very much wants you to hit the ground running; quite literally, in fact. As soon as the spectral birds that are your carriers drop you in Limveld, it's up to you to decide where to go, what to do, and how best to spend your time.</p>

<p>Eventually, optimal routes will begin to reveal themselves, and it won't be long before you're creating complex routes in your mind, planning which locations should be visited and on what days. What starts as an intimidating, overwhelming core loop quickly becomes intoxicating.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Combat Feels Great</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-arrow.jpg?itok=SMO_PXcn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-arrow.jpg?itok=a1OTCyJM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Archery, in particular, has had a lot of attention paid to it in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It helps that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s combat is...well, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s combat, and for my money, it's the sharpest, smoothest iteration of the series' trademark weighty action-RPG fighting we've seen so far.</p>

<p>While most weapons and moves feel largely the same as they do in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, a couple of key improvements have been made. Bows feel great now, having been given a similar treatment to magic's glow-up in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; you can now easily and quickly fire off arrows, making archer Ironeye feel like a true master of his craft.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer game, customizable characters have been done away with in favor of character archetypes. There are six to start, plus two more you'll unlock in due course, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>Wylder, for instance, is a jack-of-all-trades greatsword wielder with a gap-closing hookshot, while the Recluse is a magic user whose unique skill must be used well in order to balance her insatiable hunger for mana. The aforementioned Ironeye is a mobile archer, while the Raider is a fearsome Viking type with a huge axe.</p>

<p>Each archetype feels distinct and enjoyable, and they slot into groups well. Trying out combinations of these characters is one of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s great joys, as is finding synergies between their core skills. Lining up the perfect Ironeye arrow after the Recluse has marked an enemy for extra damage feels sublime.</p>

<p>Outside of the character archetype changes,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s combat is largely untouched from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>salad days. If you loved the way&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>felt to play, then you're going to enjoy the core loop in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>as well. If you didn't, there's nothing here to convert you.</p>

<h2>Limveld Gets Repetitive Quickly in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-evergaol.jpg?itok=lsPn8CeM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-evergaol.jpg?itok=U4Bn4fGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be seeing a lot of the same stuff in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>runs.</figcaption></figure><p>It's outside of that core combat, when it comes time to explore <i>Nightreign</i>'s map, that things start to feel a touch more wobbly. Limveld itself is procedurally generated, but its locations aren't; every castle, camp, and ruin has the same layout.</p>

<p>For that reason, it really doesn't take long for things to start feeling repetitive. The pool of locations in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is pretty small, and once you've seen one ruin, you've seen 'em all. It doesn't matter whether it's Albinauric archers or Beastmen of Farum Azula waiting for you there; they're still lurking in the same dilapidated old buildings.</p>

<p>Repetition sets in worryingly quickly in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. I think a few more locations, or perhaps even a few more layouts for existing locations, would work wonders. As it is, despite its procedural generation shaking up positioning, Limveld feels decidedly more staid and dull than its bigger cousin.</p>

<p>Not only that, but on a number of my runs, I encountered three camps that all had the same bosses lying in wait for me. One set of Redmane Knights on a run is acceptable, but two is pushing it, and three feels like a programming error. Simply put,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>needs more variety in its map and enemy design.</p>

<p>Happily, however, there are some elements that break things up a little. Shifting Earth events add new geographical features to Limveld, like a swamp of Scarlet Rot, a frigid mountain to climb, or an honest-to-Marika entire city that you and your team can explore.</p>

<p>Engaging in these extra events can be hugely dangerous, but it can also result in some pretty tasty rewards for your squad. Of course, the layout of these Shifting Earth events doesn't change much from run to run either, so it's a temporary balm for the repetition, but it's nice nonetheless.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s Lore Sure Is There</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-nameless-king.jpg?itok=UCsZyPdn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-nameless-king.jpg?itok=m67X564v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>What is the Nameless King doing here? That's anyone's guess.</figcaption></figure><p>I'm a lorehound when it comes to FromSoftware games, and I admit that the lore and storytelling in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>just doesn't feel like it has the spark of the base game (or, indeed, of the original&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bloodborne" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodborne</em></a>).</p>

<p>This time around, storytelling is mostly achieved via text-based character stories called "remembrances". Each character has a backstory, and you can advance that story by collecting memory fragments from the world, some of which will trigger objectives you can tackle on your next run.</p>

<p>These objectives might, for instance, involve finding an item in a certain location, or beating a boss or a Nightlord in order to progress. Completing them rewards you with more backstory for the character in question, and you may also uncover relationships between characters, friendly or adversarial.</p>

<p>The thing is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;- and, indeed, the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series in general - is very often more focused on the world rather than those who live in it. I don't really find&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s characters particularly interesting, and since Limgrave's procedural generation makes it feel a little uncanny, I can't say the world is too compelling either.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the lore and story very much take a backseat to&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s gameplay, so if you just want to focus on slaying bosses and learning synergies, you can very much do that.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that FromSoftware games often benefit from the tireless efforts of lore archaeologists to uncover every nook and cranny of their stories, and naturally, at the time of writing, they haven't had the time to do so.&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may, in due course, benefit from a thorough excavation of its narrative.</p>

<h2>Bosses Are Where&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Truly Shines</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-augur.jpg?itok=wl0dJj9A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-augur.jpg?itok=19n6NZyB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s bosses are beautiful and brutal.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've played a FromSoftware game before, you'll know that boss encounters are arguably where the studio truly shines, and I'm very happy to report that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is no exception in this area.</p>

<p>To put it simply, <i>Nightreign</i>'s boss encounters are an exhilarating rush. Each of its eight Nightlords feels distinct, and while some of them are a touch more uninspired than others (there's yet another big ol' dragon in here), they all thrillingly demand their own tactical adaptation.</p>

<p>The first boss, for instance, is Gladius, a three-headed dog that swings a chain around and commands fire. Partway through the fight, Gladius suddenly splits into three separate dogs, and you'll need to keep an eye on all three before they recombine in order to win.</p>

<p>My personal favorite was the Augur, an Elden Beast-like being made of water that gracefully flits around the arena, splashing you with tidal waves and summoning explosive jellyfish to keep you on your toes. It may not have been the most mechanically challenging fight, but it shows FromSoftware's majestic grandeur is still very much in evidence.</p>

<p>I won't spoil&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s boss surprises, but suffice it to say I came away thoroughly satisfied with each of its Nightlords. There are only eight, too, as far as I'm aware; I'm sure FromSoftware will add more through paid DLC, but this isn't a live-service title, so don't expect monthly updates with more bosses.</p>

<p>You can, of course, continue to hunt down remembrances and play&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>after its final boss encounter has ended, but not every game needs to demand every waking hour of your time, and <i>Nightreign</i>'s determination to give you a way out if you want one at its conclusion is commendable.</p>

<h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-tree-spirit.jpg?itok=u5GJgf1K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-review-tree-spirit.jpg?itok=pCIMZP2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>has plenty of greatest-hits bosses for you to fight.</figcaption></figure><p>I was pleasantly surprised by&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. What cautiously won me over in the network test became an addictive compulsion over the course of my time with FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment, and I have no trouble unreservedly recommending it to anyone who loves&nbsp;<em>Souls</em>&nbsp;games' core combat loop.</p>

<p>I only wish Limveld was a more lively, vibrant place. Its procedural generation feels particularly uninspired, and although that can help with route optimization, I'd rather be wrongfooted and have to adapt than see the same scenery over and over again.</p>

<p>Still, focusing on&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s excellent boss encounters and range of build synergies should keep combat-happy Nightfarers sated. Just don't look too closely at the arenas you're fighting the monsters in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has made its first ever gaming studio acquisition in the form of&nbsp;<em>Sneaky Sasquatch&nbsp;</em>developer RAC7, and a report has also suggested that a new gaming-focused app could be on the way.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/apple-acquires-rac7-sneaky-sasquatch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a>, Apple says it's "excited" that RAC7 has joined it, and that it intends to "continue to deliver a great experience for Apple Arcade players", offering "hundreds of games from many of the best game developers in the world".</p>

<p>RAC7 consists of just two employees, namely artist Jason Ennis and programmer Jesse Ringrose. The studio's previous works include sound-based horror game&nbsp;<em>Dark Echo&nbsp;</em>and "free-form puzzle game"&nbsp;<em>Splitter Critters</em>.</p>

<p>In the report, Gurman, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", says that the Cupertino giant is planning to introduce a "dedicated app for video games" on iOS devices later this year.</p>

<p>Said app will apparently serve as a launcher for games on the platform, and it'll also feature leaderboards, achievements, and "editorial content...about new titles". It's apparently intended to replace the Game Center app.</p>

<p>Gurman's isn't the first report to claim that Apple is developing a new gaming-focused app, either; back in 2024, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/22/apple-new-app-store-like-app-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">9to5Mac's Filipe Espósito</a> said Apple was working on a "new App Store-like app dedicated to games", which, if Bloomberg's report is accurate, is almost certainly the same app.</p>

That's also when the next set of Apple iPhone devices are likely to be revealed.</p>

<p>The news comes shortly after a major blow was dealt to Apple last month in the form of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">€500 million fine</a> issued by the European Commission over the company's refusal to allow developers to point customers to non-App Store-related payment systems and third-party app stores.</p>

<p>Epic's&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was at the center of that row, and following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">worldwide outage</a> that Epic says was caused by Apple blocking the game's release on iOS,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally reappeared</a> on Apple's operating system last week.</p>

<p>At this point, <em>Elden Ring</em> is well-known for its epic sense of scale, offering players dozens of hours of meticulous exploration, gradual character progression, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/is-elden-ring-really-that-hard-well-it-depends-what-you-mean-by-hard/">unforgiving enemy encounters</a> that require deliberate care and strategy. On its face, this doesn't seem like the best basis for a semi-randomized multiplayer action game spin-off with strict time limits and an ever-encroaching physical border in a tightly constrained map.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> makes the combination work. The game condenses all the essential parts of <em>Elden Ring</em> down to their barest essence, tweaking things just enough to distill the flavor of a full-fledged <em>Elden Ring</em> playthrough into zippy runs of less than an hour each. The result is a fast-paced, quick-hit shot of adventuring that is well suited to repeated play with friends.</p>
<h2>Fort-elden Ring-nite</h2>
<p>The initial moments of each <em>Nightreign</em> run draw an almost comical comparison to <em>Fortnite</em>, with each player dropping into the game's singular map by hanging off the talons of a great spectral eagle. Once on the ground, players have to stay inside a circular "safe zone" that will slowly contract throughout each of two quick in-game days, forcing your party toward an eventual encounter with a mini-boss at the end of each day. If you survive both days, you take on one of the several extremely punishing Nightlords you chose to face at the beginning of that run.</p>

<p>If you've played <em>Elden Ring</em>, you'll definitely recognize the general fallen world aesthetic on display here, as well as many specific enemies and items taken directly from FromSoft's previous epic. What will be less familiar is the general pace of play, which is guided by that encroaching circle of deadly blue flame. Instead of taking your time and exploring every nook and cranny for hidden secrets, you end up dashing between points of interest highlighted on the map in a madcap attempt to farm enough experience points and powerful items to have a chance against the big bosses.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>There are a few crucial tweaks to the <em>Elden Ring</em> formula aiding you in this newly speed-focused effort. For one thing, your character now has an unlimited "surge sprint" that can get you from one part of the map to another at a pretty rapid clip. For another, there's a nice springy wall jump that lets you climb up stairstep cliffs and walls that are much taller than your character. Add in occasional jump pads for quickly leaping over cliffs and a complete lack of fall damage for descending into valleys, and you get a game that feels more like a 3D <em>Sonic</em> than <em>Elden Ring</em> at points.</p>

<p>Things feel more like the old <em>Elden Ring</em> during battles, where you'll quickly fall into the familiar rhythm of managing limited stamina to attack, block, and dodge enemies' heavily telegraphed attacks. Even here, though, things feel a little more action-oriented thanks to powerful, class-specific "character skills" and "ultimate art" attacks that slowly recharge over time. The quick pace of leveling also aids in the power fantasy, condensing the progression from zero to hero into an extremely tight time frame, relative to <em>Elden Ring</em> proper.</p>

<h2>Try, try again</h2>
<p>Speaking of classes, the eight on offer here tend to fall into the usual archetypes for this kind of action-adventure game: the tank, the mage, the defensive specialist, the dextrous dodger, etc. For myself, I tended toward the Ironeye class, with an unlimited supply of arrows that let me deliver consistent (if relatively weak) damage against flying and/or zigzagging bosses, all while maintaining a safe range from all but the widest-ranged attacks.</p>
<p>But one big benefit of <em>Nightreign</em>'s faster-paced design is that you don't have to tie yourself to a specific class for hundreds of hours at the outset. You'll get ample opportunity to try them all—and different combinations with teammate classes—across dozens of individual, bite-size runs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>As you do, you'll start to learn the general shape of the map, which is well-designed with a few distinct geographic regions and points of interest. While the specific enemies and items you'll find in various locations will change from run to run, you'll quickly develop a feel for the landmarks and general routes you'll want to at least consider exploring each time.</p>

<p>Repeated runs also help you develop the key sense of when it's worthwhile to fight and when it makes more sense to run away. This is especially important at the beginning of each run, where your low-level character needs to focus on farming fodder enemies until you are powerful enough to take on the lowest tier of sub-bosses you might stumble across. Later in the run, you'll need to shift to ignoring those low-level enemies so you can spend more time gaining big rewards from the even bigger bosses.</p>
<p>Even with a decent general strategy, though, players shouldn't expect to be able to win every run in <em>Nightreign</em>. During some runs you may find only garbage weapon drops or low-level enemies that make it hard to quickly build up the critical mass of power you'll need by the final encounter. During other runs you may chance upon a great weapon that causes enough bleed damage to make even the most difficult bosses relatively easy to kill.</p>
<p>Then there are the runs where you get greedy doubling back to a lucrative encounter on the edge of the safety circle, only to find yourself quickly engulfed in blue flame. Or the ones where you take one wrong step and fall to your doom down a cliffside while trying to dodge away from a relatively harmless enemy, losing a crucial character level (and your momentum) when you respawn.</p>

<p>In between runs you can equip relics that offer small permanent stat boosts to the various classes. In general, though, success in <em>Nightreign</em> is a matter of keeping at it until you stumble on the right mix of luck and execution to finally best the Nightlords.</p>
<h2>Find a friend</h2>
<p>While <em>Nightreign</em> technically has a single player mode, the game is quite explicitly designed for groups of three simultaneous humans (groups of two need not apply—paired players will need to join up with a third). Being in a threesome generally means that one player can draw an enemy's attack while the other two take advantage by flanking around their guard. It also means that downed players can be revived by a partner repeatedly hitting their crawling near-corpse with a weapon, an awkward and hilarious process in practice.</p>

              Does this count as three-on-one odds, or do the multiple heads on the beast make it more of a fair fight?

<p>Being able to coordinate with your teammates is crucial both during battles and as you decide which location to explore next in the ever-narrowing circle of the available map. If you're not playing with friends and chatting over a voice connection, your main form of communication is an awkward system of pinning points of interest on the map.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I ran into some serious problems with lag in my pre-release multiplayer runs, with the game periodically freezing for multiple seconds at a time as the servers struggled to keep up. I often came out of these freezes to find I had succumbed to an enemy attack that I hadn't even seen on my screen. I can't say this server performance in a tightly controlled pre-launch environment bodes well for how the game will perform once the wider public gains access in a few days.</p>

<p>Those technical problems aside, I was surprised at how well this zippy, capsule-size take on the <em>Elden Ring</em> formula worked in practice. <em>Nightreign</em> might not be the full-fledged, epic <em>Elden Ring</em> sequel that long-time "Soulsborne" fans are looking for, but it's still a compelling, action-packed twist on the popular adventure gameplay.</p>

While no other details are provided, the update's timing and focus suggest that Nintendo is emphasizing cross-platform performance and backwards compatibility to ensure a smooth console transition.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Prior to this, its last update came back in November 2022, when Nintendo wrapped up its ongoing support for the game. New Horizons originally launched in March 2020 at the onset of widespread lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/" data-ref-id="1100-6477018">which supercharged its popularity</a>. However, despite its adoption rate by Switch owners, Nintendo has not announced plans for a specific Switch 2 version of the game, unlike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">other headliners such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Ahead of the hotly anticipated launch of Switch 2 next week, a steady stream of news about the console has emerged. For example, Nintendo has gradually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">revealed the cross-platform games that are getting Switch 2 enhanced editions</a>. Relatedly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A comes out in October for both consoles</a>, and the Switch 2 version will have improved graphics and performance.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>The upcoming Pokémon Legends game will launch across Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> on 16th October. Pre orders for Pokémon Legends: Z-A will begin on 5th June, via the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Along with revealing the release date, Nintendo also shared the upcoming game's cover art, which you can see in full further down this article, although I cropped it a bit for the header image above if you just fancy a taster now that you know the date.</p>

<p>"In addition to the Nintendo Switch title, a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will offer improved graphics and frame rates," the <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1927712162778099735">Pokémon social media account</a> added in an additional post. "The digital and physical versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> can be upgraded to the  Nintendo Switch 2 Edition via upgrade pack."</p>
<p>As for the game itself, here's what the official blurb says: "Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a new frontier for the Pokémon video game series, blending an RPG story unfolding in a single city with action elements and a real-time battle system unlike anything seen before in the franchise. </p>
<p>Trainers can look forward to the beginning of a new adventure in Lumiose City - one woven by people and Pokémon together!"</p>

			<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A will arrive on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this year on&nbsp;<strong>October 16, 2025</strong>, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have announced. It'll be available on both the Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, with the Switch 2 version featuring "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>."</p>
<p>It's right around the time we were expecting the release date to be, because mainline Pokémon releases have all recently launched in that same fall-early winter window to get it in just ahead of the holidays, and because that was the release window Nintendo revealed earlier this year during a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-new-trailer-confirmes-late-2025-release-window-new-extended-look-gameplay-video-released/">Pokémon Presents presentation</a>. You'll be able to pre-order Legends Z-A when the Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company announced the news with a <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1927712162778099735">post on its official X account</a>, sharing a new piece of key art for the game. "<em>Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives October 16, 2026!</em>" the caption for the post reads.</p>
<p>"<em>In addition to the Nintendo Switch title, a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will offer improved graphics and frame rates! The digital and physical versions of Pokémon Legends Z-A can be upgraded to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition via upgrade pack</em>."</p>
<p>There's also going to be another <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1927712715335712964">Pokémon Presents event on July 22, 2025</a>, which will likely showcase more of what's to come in Legends Z-A, and hopefully some news on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-mmo/">what else we can expect to play</a> from the world of Pokémon.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For the<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html"> 150 million+</a> that already own a Nintendo Switch, it's great that one of the biggest series on the platform will still be available on the Switch 1, but it'll be interesting to see what the release of Legends Z-A does for Nintendo Switch 2 sales.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Nintendo Switch 2 is only days away from launching globally, and there's no doubt it'll be a big seller for the rest of the year. But with how poorly the recent major Pokémon releases on the Nintendo Switch have been from a<a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/"> technical perspective</a>, it wouldn't be surprising if the launch of Legends Z-A pushes people to upgrade more than any other game we know about in the console's launch year.</p>
<p>Especially if Pokémon Legends Z-A arrives and is borderline unplayable on the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>release date, and we also now know when the next Pokemon Presents showcase is set to air.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Release-Date-for-Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Revealed-and-Pokemon-Presents-Vid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which had already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">slated for a late 2025 launch</a>, will be arriving on October 16th. Pre-orders for the game will be opening on June 5th, which is the same <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">day of the Switch 2's launch</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will be available on both the Switch 2 and the original Switch, and if you buy it on the older machine, you'll be able to pay to upgrade your version to the Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-august-2023" rel="nofollow">often</a> a Pokemon Presents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-from-pokemon-presents-about-arceus-and-gen-4-remakes" rel="nofollow">show</a> during the summer, and this year's is set to air on July 22nd, with The Pokemon Company promising to reveal "the latest news and updates from the world of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>".</p>

<p>I'd be very surprised indeed if we didn't get at least a hint about the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, which will almost certainly be exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2. Expect more info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>prior to its release as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, following on from 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em></a>.</p>




<p>While&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>took place during the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>world's past,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>will instead be set in the present day. It'll take place entirely inside Lumiose City, which is currently in the midst of an urban redevelopment plan.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Switch 2</a> on October 16th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/674577/to-a-t-review-keita-takahashi-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>From the worm-like character stretching to the length of the planetary system in <em>Noby Noby Boy</em>, to the tiny Prince hoarding a spherical mass of objects and even buildings in <em>Katamari Damacy</em>, the heroes of Keita Takahashi’s games reflect the creator’s whimsical vision. <em>To a T</em> is yet another Takahashi title that fits that playful tradition, well, to a tee. The protagonist is a young teen, aptly named Teen, whose body is permanently stuck in a T-pose. But while they may be able to wiggle their fingers a little or move their wrists to reach out for an item, their elbows are woefully nonexistent.</p><p>That’s okay, though! Like most of Takahashi’s games, <em>To a T</em> is also a heartwarming tale about self-acceptance. Prep, an indie pop band from England, even composed an infectious, chirpy theme song for the game about already being the perfect shape, no matter what you look like.</p><p>In a world where elbows are very much an accessory to daily life, Teen has to go through some pretty unconventional routines due to their irreversibly stiff arms. For one thing, Teen can’t put on clothes, use the toilet, or even dry their face on their own. Even walking down the street can be a little cumbersome, since their outstretched arms mean they may inadvertently slap their hands into another passerby. Fortunately for Teen, they have a trusty sidekick — a dog named Dog — who’s more than eager to help them navigate these tasks.</p><p>Take washing your face, which can initially be an unfamiliar affair. As Teen, you’ll need to twist your upper body, reaching your hand toward the tap — one that’s uniquely designed for Teen’s predicament — and lower your head, so the stream of water spurts upward to your face. Then, you’ll hold your position until your face is clean and free of persistent eye boogers. Brushing your teeth is another fiddly routine. This is done by reaching for a toothbrush with a particularly long handle, getting Dog’s help in squirting a bit of toothpaste on it, and then scrubbing your teeth until they’re squeaky clean.</p><p>But these activities aren’t designed to be tedious; you aren’t carefully calibrating every small movement like you would in physics games like Bennett Foddy’s <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em>. Instead, these are simply different sorts of routines you’ll need to get used to. When your arms are resolutely perpendicular to your body, these activities are just all in a day’s work.</p><p>They’re also genuinely joyful, even if the movements can appear superfluous. Rinsing your mouth is a matter of wriggling the analog stick or direction keys and then pressing another button to spit the water out into the sink. But you can also shake your head while doing that, so that your spit will trickle out like a meandering, miniature waterfall. Using the toilet allows you to mash several buttons, just so you can listen to Teen huffing and grunting as they go about their business behind closed doors. There’s really no point to doing so other than giggling at these sights and sounds, but it’s such a delightful way of prodding at the game’s inherent silliness. That’s the beauty behind <em>To a T</em> — it has zero pretensions about the kind of game it’s trying to be. </p><p>In fact, <em>To a T</em> later informs you that you can skip any of these routines if you like. Want to eat breakfast without brushing your teeth right after? If you can tolerate seeing green gunk stuck on your teeth for the rest of the day, go right ahead. The game isn’t going to penalize you for skipping teeth brushing for a day — or two.</p><p><em>To a T</em> is chockful of such diminutive joys. Breakfast consists of cereal and flavored milk every day, such as chocolate, matcha, and mango, and there’s a small thrill in discovering what these mixtures would taste like to Teen. In one meal, Teen commented that the cereal tasted like rubbery tires, and in another it was an explosion of strange, candy flavors. Regardless of the taste, they welcomed every mouthful of these sugary treats with gusto.</p><p>Exploring the neighborhood, particularly on weekends, feels especially liberating, as your day is seemingly filled with endless possibilities for fun. Eateries offer minigames in the form of speed-eating contests, as you devour a giant corn on the cob and even hailstorms of ice cream. There are coins to collect and discover among the shrubberies and rooftops, new shops to look at, and fascinating locales — from a lighthouse to a magical mushroom forest — to get lost in. Even attending school was an adventure, even though Teen was largely reluctant to head to class in his first few days due to relentless bullying, a problem that does get resolved. </p><div><p><cite>Image: Annapurna Interactive</cite></p></div><p>Eventually, Teen discovers an innate talent for flying. By spinning on their toes like a ballerina, they gain the ability to traverse higher grounds. This skill does have a bit of a learning curve, however. As it turns out, flying isn’t particularly intuitive, and it took me several tries to get my feet off the ground. But as with most gimmicks in <em>To a T</em>, failing isn’t really that big of a deal-breaker. You’re free to wander around town however you prefer, be it flying, running, or riding a unicycle.</p><p>As you delve deeper into the game, <em>To a T</em> spins an increasingly ludicrous-yet-charming tale, one that Takahashi himself has referred to as being rather “stupid” in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/it-is-very-touching-and-very-stupid-katamari-damacy-creator-cant-wait-for-us-to-experience-the-final-scene-of-his-new-game/">an interview</a>. Having finished the game, I can attest that one of its final moments is, indeed, almost irredeemably nonsensical. Yet it also made me crack a really wide smile, something I haven’t done while playing games in a while.</p><p>Playing and making games amid a politically fraught climate may seem frivolous, and this is <a href="https://www.vg247.com/keita-takahashi-on-wattam-and-the-superfluousness-of-video-games">an issue</a> that Takahashi mentioned he was struggling with when he was working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021203/wattam-review-ps4-pc-katamari">his previous game, <em>Wattam</em></a>. But <em>To a T</em>’s central message of acceptance, and of finding joy in life’s smallest moments, feels like a salve for these trying times. At the very least, its positivity gave me the impetus to keep trudging on — hopefully it’ll do the same for you, too.</p><p><sub>To a T <em>launches on May 28th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s due to be with us on October 16, with pre-orders starting as early as June 5.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195752,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Coming to both the original Switch and the Switch 2, the new game from Game Freak will offer an upgraded version for the newer Nintendo console, which will boast a higher resolution and improved framerates. However, this will come at the cost of an upgrade fee—likely $10, based on the Japanese announcement of 1,000 yen.</p><p>  <em>Z-A</em>, set exclusively in Lumiose City within the Kalos region, is essentially a follow-up to 2013's <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em>, while also the second in the <em>Legends</em> franchise. Which is to say,  it will play differently from the mainline series, especially when it comes to combat. <em>Z-A</em> will use real-time fighting between your Pokémon, rather than the traditional turn-based battles, and will include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521">Mega Evolution</a></span> as a core mechanic. It also looks unlikely to have the same open feel as <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, given the game is entirely set in one city.</p><p>In Lumoise City, Pokémon co-exist with humans, rather than being considered pets/captives. The city—originally based on Paris—is undergoing urban redevelopment by a company called Quasartico, which appears to be a pivotal aspect of the as-yet undetailed story. What we do know, however, is that play will be split into day and night. During the day, you’ll explore, chat with the locals, and progress through the story. During the night, the local Wild Zones become Battle Zones, where you take part in the Z-A Battle, attempting to climb your way up through the ranks from, well, Z to A. Here you’ll battle other trainers in real-time combat with your current collection of Poké pals.</p><p>If you’re not planning to upgrade your Switch just yet, don’t worry. <em>Z-A</em> seems to have been primarily developed for the original hybrid console, with the Switch 2 upgraded version tweaking things to run more smoothly with the extra horsepower. We don’t have prices yet, although given pre-ordering starts as soon as next week, we don’t have long to wait. $60 for the Switch version and $70 for the Switch 2 seems extremely likely, however.</p><p>It’s interesting that <em>Z-A</em> is releasing in the slot we’d usually expect to see a new mainline game in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise. It likely speaks well of Game Freak, which was clearly overworked in its efforts to release two full-size games in 2022—hopefully the developers will be&nbsp;given more time and space to work on these projects from here on out.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
