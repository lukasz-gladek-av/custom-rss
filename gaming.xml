<figure data-uuid="7fc8ef16a4588"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fc8ef16a4588/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the massive Switch 2 sales out of the gate, Nintendo's shares have been slipping throughout December, dropping as much as 4.7% yesterday. Why? It seems fears surrounding chip shortages may be to blame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) estimates that Nintendo's market value may have already decreased by as much as $14 billion this month, as Switch 2 RAM module costs have leapt up 41% in the quarter.</p>
<p>It's not just RAM either. The console's NAND storage has also seen an estimated 8% price rise, as both SanDisk and Samsung have delayed shipments of flash chips due to "increased demand from large data centres and hyperscalers", according to a <a href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/1996105253545279875">recent statement</a> from SSD manufacturer Transcend.</p>
<p>This shortage explains the pricy state of microSD Express cards — the <em>only</em> expandable storage method for Switch 2 — which regularly sit at the best part of $200 for the beefy 1TB option and around $60-$80 for the smaller 256GB. "This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed onto the gamer," Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Of course, the holiday season is near-enough guaranteed to be a big one for Nintendo and the Switch 2. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">upped its sales forecast</a> from 15 million to 19 million Switch 2 sales by the end of the financial year, and its impressive start is nothing to be scoffed at.</p>
<p>But consoles cost money to make, and if memory costs stay on the up-and-up, who knows what the company will need to do to keep its profits moving in the right direction.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="503">If you’re a runner or really anyone who’s serious about fitness, a reliable watch is a must. The best way to improve yourself at any activity is by setting incremental goals, and you can’t effectively track your progress without the right tools. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a tough, durable smartwatch that’s designed to be your perfect partner, whether you’re in the gym or building your cardio the great outdoors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/">Right now, you can grab it at Amazon for $250 off, bringing the price down to $549 from its regular price of $799.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, a massive wave of layoffs at Xbox affected several gaming projects, including announced titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/"><strong>a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online</strong></a>, and many others. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">The next unannounced project by Romero Games</a></strong>, the studio created by DOOM series creator John Romero, was also cancelled, but today, it has been confirmed that it has been saved, and though its scope has been changed, it will be an innovative experience in the vein of FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@htdreams"><strong>Andrés De Pedro Álvarez</strong></a>, speaking at the Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 last week, the creator of the DOOM series confirmed that the unannounced project has been saved. However, the game has been redesigned and has become something different despite incorporating many elements from the title canceled earlier this year.</p>



<p>Though the DOOM series creator couldn't get into specifics other than the fact that the game is much smaller than before, he did say that he has never played a game like this shooter before. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience,"</em> Romero said. </p>



<p>Comparing the game to a masterpiece like FromSoftware's is definitely bold, but also very exciting, especially coming from the developer that contributed to the creation of the genre with Wolfenstein 3D and its establishment with the DOOM and Quake series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The confirmation that the next project from Romero Games has been saved is rather welcome, but not entirely surprising. Following the cancellation of the game that Xbox would have published, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/"><strong>the studio had not closed and was evaluating opportunities from other publishers</strong></a>. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the first glimpses of a game that already sounds very interesting.</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' winter update's now got got a proper release date. Snow will be coming to the shooter on December 16th, and judging by the way Embark have revealed that, it looks like there could be a temperature-based twist coming to the usual murder-deathing and trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-140-takes-aim-at-locked-room-exploits-and-item-swap-induced-rapid-fire">sneak into places you shouldn't</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-first-roadmap-promises-lots-of-goodies-like-a-new-map-quests-and-more-before-the-end-of-the-year">roadmap</a> Embark put out last month offers a good glimpse into what'll be coming with this update, dubbed Cold Snap. The snowfall map condition, which does what it says on the tin, will bring with it a "Flickering Flames" event, a new raider deck, and new quests.</p>
<p>Plus, a day after Cold Snap drops, the chance to reset your character via a prestige-esque extraction project will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">start being offered</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Cool. While the addition of snow alone's not much to write home about, the fact Embark have revealed Cold Snap's arrival date via a shot of a dead bloke lying in the now does seem like it might suggest some survival-style temperature mechanics you'll have to stay on the right side of in order not to catch your death. Maybe flickering flames is all about chucking yourself into a fire before your fingers and toes start to freeze up and fall off.</p><p>Cold Snap marks the end of the additions Embark have pulled back the curtain on thus far, with a fresh roadmap for 2026 likely to arrive not long after the calendar flips over, if not before then.

              <p>The shock of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> having stumbled out of the gate</a> has clearly hit publisher Activision hard. Reports that the latest entry in the annual franchise has seen a slump in player numbers are seemingly <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">confirmed by a statement</a> the publisher put out late last night, in which it was stated that “the Franchise has not met your expectations fully,” and that as a result there will no longer be “back-to-back releases of <em>Modern Warfare</em> or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>games.”</p> <p>For over 20 years, the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> franchise has been the backbone of Microsoft-owned Activision’s sales, more often than not the best-selling game of a given year, and routinely bringing in in excess of $2 billion. But in 2025, that run seems to have once more faltered. Observable player numbers are way down, user reviews are extremely bad, and old rivals like <em>Battlefield</em> have reappeared and eaten its lunch.</p>

 <p>To be completely clear, <em>Black Ops 7</em> isn’t a disaster! It will likely make a solid profit, perhaps be one of the best-selling games of 2025, but the issue likes in Activision’s colossal expectations for the series. Anything short of record-breaking popularity is perceived as failure, given how much of the company’s financial claims will have been predicated on such success. This has clearly spooked the now Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard so much that it’s made a public statement, ostensibly directed to players but clearly aimed at shareholders, to <em>mea culpa</em> and promise to do better next year.</p>

 <p>The whole statement is a masterclass in euphemism, each negative phrased as a positive, its opening paragraph thanking us for “the feedback” from a “passionate community” (“please stop yelling!”) and stating “we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver,” (“we fucked up, we know we fucked up!”).</p>

 <p>After announcing a free week next week for multiplayer and Zombies, and explaining how impossibly brilliant the seasonal updates are going to be, the statement eventually states that “our strategy going forward is changing.”</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>This seems very much designed to respond to widespread complaints that this year’s outing feels too familiar with a terrible always-online campaign, thus losing the public’s wider interests when there’s a big, bold and fresh-feeling <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be playing instead.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">A&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> interview</a> with&nbsp;<em>The Game Business</em>‘s Chris Dring last week reported that not only had&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> not performed well since its November 14 release, but that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has a whole has seen far lower numbers of players throughout 2025. While no official sales or player numbers have been reported by Activision, and things are futher obfuscated by the game being released on Game Pass, public facing stats like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">those of&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> show just how few people are playing&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> on Steam compared to both previous years&nbsp;<em>and</em> this years strong competition in the form of <em>Battlefield 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em> and free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>.</p>

 <h2>Innovation vs. escalation</h2> <p>Of course, what this statement is&nbsp;<em>not</em> saying is that there won’t be a new&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> in 2026, but rather that it won’t be&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>. The last time the franchise featured any other branch was 2021’s <em>Call of Duty:</em> <em>Vanguard</em>, and before that, 2017’s <em>Call of Duty: WWII.</em> Both were the best-selling games in the U.S. in their years, but it’s noteworthy that Activision was still disappointed by&nbsp;<em>Vanguard</em>‘s sales, <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-call-duty-vanguard-modern-warfare-2-release-1848873636">blaming this on the World War II setting and a lack of “innovation.”</a></p>

 <p>It seems we’re back there once again, although this time the franchise is in a tougher spot. <em>Vanguard</em>‘s perceived failures were cited as being because of what it <em>wasn’t</em>, and the company was able to declare that no one need worry (it was in the midst of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-that-has-happened-since-the-activision-blizz-1847401161">sexual abuse scandals</a>, some <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600">specific to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600"> management</a>, as well as trying to ensure its $69 billion sale to Microsoft), and that next year there would instead be a game-changing new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> series. But this time, the statement promises nothing at all beyond hopes and dreams, given falling back on what’s worked before clearly isn’t the answer.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if there even is an answer. 22 years of annual releases (plus spin-offs) is enough to exhaust even the most ardent, die-hard fan, and after a while just the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” can feel leaden, even outdated. It would be more sensible for Activision and Microsoft to pull back on expectations, perhaps spend less on a game that innovates rather than escalates, fascinating a gaming audience into not wanting to be left out. But given the need to appease shareholders, the forced move is always to go bigger, spend more, risk more, and make more. If the issue really is general fatigue among players, that could be a hefty disaster.</p> <p>“To be clear,” ends the “Call of Duty team’s” statement, “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.” It continues,</p> <blockquote><p>“We have been building the next era of <em>Call of Duty</em>, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s going to be an interesting year.</p>

            <p>Netflix considers Warner Bros.' game studios to be "relatively minor", as it admits they didn't factor into its $82.7bn acquisition deal.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros.</a>, which would include its game studios as part of the bid. That said, gaming was not mentioned in the press release for the news, while a webcast for the news only included gaming in passing.</p>
<p>Now, in the company's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters made it clear gaming was not a major consideration as part of its bid. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," he said.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Warner Bros. has been struggling in the games industry as of late. In its 2025 Q1 earnings report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">company reported a 48 percent decrease in games revenue due to no new releases</a>. Its most recent earnings report from November reports a 23 percent decrease, again due to no new releases.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; layoffs at Rocksteady after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopped</a>; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it's not as if Warner Bros. isn't capable of success. A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> had sold over 34m copies, making it one of the best-selling games ever. A sequel is reportedly in the works.</p><p>"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering," said Peters in the Netflix earnings call. "Quite well" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>He continued: "They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."</p>
<p>Though harsh, there's certainly some truth in Peters' comments. Hogwarts Legacy's success alone isn't enough to keep Warner Bros.' gaming studios afloat. And while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">change in leadership came in June as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, Game of Thrones), nothing has been seen yet.</p>
<p>Still, it appears gaming is not a priority for Netflix, which doesn't bode well for the future of these studios. So while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, it's unclear how this may be impacted by the acquisition.</p>
<p>And it's not quite over yet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-to-ruin-the-netflix-party-hollywood-studio-announces-clearly-superior-warner-bros-offer-of-its-own">Paramount has also made a public offer for Warner Bros.</a>, in a bid to outdo Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3 (2023)</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> being two of the worst received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> games, Activision has stated that they will not to do back-to-back games in their Call of Duty sub-franchises going forward.</p>
<p>In a blog post addressing the future of the franchise, the Call of Duty team start by saying “thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months,” which is a nice way of putting it. “Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.”</p>


<p>Of course, for the next year, that means giving Black Ops 7 as much support as needed to tide them over to 2026’s COD. So next week they will be hosting a free trial for Black Ops 7 multiplayer and Zombies, hand-in-hand with a Double XP weekend.</p>
<p>“We would like you to experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves,” they say, and so they’re putting the two stronger sides of the game forward for consideration. It has been the story campaign that has come in for the strongest criticism, while multiplayer is a continuation of Black Ops 6, and remains the beating heart of this franchise.</p>
<p>Further to this, they promise “unprecedented” support through seasonal content: “Season 01 is the largest live season ever and we’re just getting started.&nbsp; We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made.”</p>

<p>But the most important point is that they will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, which has led to dismal reviews and a wave of negativity for the franchise. The team promise:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</em></li>
<li><em>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Black Ops 7 was another disappointment after the highs of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> last year. While Activision’s teams talked about how the two games were conceived around the same time, the campaign was a major disappointment, focussing entirely on co-op, replaying hits from Black Ops 2 in an unsatisfying way, and casting a pallor over the series just as shooter rivals like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a> arrived.</p>
<p>In our review, I said, “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series. It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a week, the second season of the Fallout show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will air on Amazon Prime Video</a>, and the main cast is currently busy with a series of interviews. Walton Goggins, the renowned actor behind what's arguably the most iconic character in the TV series, The Ghoul (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added to Fallout 76 as a quest-giving NPC</a>, voiced by Goggins), recently appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVH3ASR4cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Virgin Radio UK's 'Chris Evans Breakfast Show'</a> to reveal that creator Jonathan Nolan, the producers, the cast and the whole staff 'went for broke' instead of playing it safe with this second season.</p>



<p><em>I've been in this situation a few times where, if over the course of the first chapter of a show, if you will, if you're able to build a critical mass, what you have an opportunity to do in season two or chapter 2, is play it safe or go for broke and put everything in there. And that's what we did. We, meaning like, us in front of the camera, but really everybody behind the camera. There are 700 people employed by the Fallout show. It is a world.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, the actor showered Jonathan Nolan with praise for the scene in the first season's pilot when the bombs start dropping and his character, Cooper Howard, runs with his daughter for their lives.</p>



<p><em>It's based on one of the biggest video games in the world, right? Fallout. This game has been played for 20-some years by players all over the world, and there's a very unique attachment to this experience. When we set out to do this, Jonathan Nolan in cahoots with Todd Howard and Bethesda Games, the idea was to tell an original story within the canon of Fallout. So yeah, it picks up in the very first episode with the ending of the world really seen through my perspective. I didn't understand what a unique opportunity that was for me until I saw it on film. Even though I experienced it, you know, on the day, but seeing it, I didn't realize that it was going to affect me viscerally the way that it did. [...] The way that John Nolan architected those shots and the way that he chose to tell that story was terrifying.</em></p>



<p>The second season of the Fallout show will run for eight episodes, just like the first one. A new episode will be released each week, with the second one scheduled for Christmas Eve, the third for New Year's Eve, and the final one for February 4, 2026. The story picks up immediately in the aftermath of the previous season's finale, taking viewers on a journey through the Mojave wasteland to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without retconning the events seen in the game Fallout: New Vegas</a>). Deathclaws have been confirmed to appear this season, too.</p>



<p>New additions to the cast of the Fallout show include Macaulay Culkin, who plays a mysterious "crazy genius" character; Justin Theroux, who portrays Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas; Kumail Nanjiani, who stars as a high-ranking officer of the Brotherhood of Steel; and Amy Acker, who will play Cooper Howard's assistant during the flashbacks. The show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already confirmed for a third season, too</a>.</p>

			<p>Among the technical solutions Sony implemented in its PlayStation 5 to enable the system to reach maximum performance without issue is a liquid metal cooling solution, which helps keep temperatures down when the system is pushed to its limits.</p>



<p>This cooling solution, however, led to significant issues, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/">the liquid metal can leak and leave dry spots on critical components, resulting in various malfunctions.</a></strong> Although Sony made some changes for the PlayStation 5 Pro and some of the latest base console models, liquid metal cooling issues can still affect systems, potentially even all of them, according to a technician.</p>



<p>Over on X,<a href="https://x.com/Modyfikator89"><strong> modder and service technician modyfikatorcasper</strong></a> shared a new report on a PlayStation 5 Slim (CFI-2016) system with less than one and a half years of life, which has been impacted by liquid metal issues. In this case, however, the liquid metal leak wasn't caused by the system's position, but by application quality and degradation over time and temperature. As such, the service technician believes all PS5 systems will eventually require maintenance, regardless of the model and its position.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>While the claim that all PlayStation 5 models will eventually require maintenance is bold, it is undeniable that the liquid metal issues have affected a lot of systems. Earlier this year, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassels highlighted how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">these issues are becoming more widespread</a></strong>, with an increasing number of users reporting various malfunctions over the past few months.</p>



<p><span>As most <span>current reports of PlayStation 5 units malfunctioning due to liquid metal issues involve older systems, it will take some time to determine if the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-consoles-improved-liquid-metal-application-similar-to-ps5-pro-prevent-leak-better-cooling/" target="_blank"><strong>new liquid metal TIM layout</strong></a>&nbsp;of the newly released&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank"><strong>CFI-2100 model</strong></a>&nbsp;has been accompanied by improved</span> application to prevent degradation over time, as it should with leaking issues.</span></p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> now out in the wild and having earned a largely mixed reception, Activision have said right, that's it, time to do a thing. Said thing is committing to no longer releasing entries in the same sub-series, be that Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in back-to-back years going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This change was relayed via a the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">CoD blog post</a>, the first paragraph of which acts as a mea culpa of sorts for Blops 7 not hitting the heights previous entries have in terms of keeping shooty folks happy. Or, as Activision put it: "We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully." Ah yes, the capital F franchise, good job of not sounding like a robot there.</p>
<p>"To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward," the publishers added, in a line that sounds slightly more human.</p>
<p>So, no more releasing Black Ops 7s right after Black Ops 6es, or Modern Warfare 3 reboots right after Modern Warfare 2 reboots, in the name of providing "an absolutely unique experience each and every year". "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental," Activision added. "While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>For now, the publishers reaffirmed their commitment to keep on adding new seasonal stuff to Black Ops 7 and working to turn around opinion on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, declaring: "We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made." They're also keeping their chins up about the series' future, asserting that they "believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.</p>
<p>If you've yet to see how Blops 7 stacks up in the great pantheon of games about military people crouch walking and using sniper rifles to kill enemies at point blank range, Rick Lane kindly reviewed both its "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">hideous mess of a campaign</a>" and its slightly better, but also "overshadowed by the spectre of generative AI" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> for us.</p>

The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Baldur's Gate 3 Cast Answers Our Burning Questions</p>
      </div>
<p>It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion.</p><p>Despite her memory issues, Shadowheart is the next-chattiest companion, while returning favorite Minsc has the least dialogue of all the companions. The full <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spreadsheet</a> has some other interesting surprises, such as the entry for "Rat" having almost three hours of unique dialogue and ranking above major characters like The Emperor and Raphael--a solid reminder that we should definitely cast Speak With Animals more often.</p><p>The total tally of spoken dialogue comes to 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds--almost 10 days worth of voice lines spread across 2068 characters.</p><p>If tallying the length of all the files wasn't enough work, Everwhite-moonlight also created a seperate <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdseRVefYowbQfc5xE9VHvMsLbk6pU6F/view" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">document</a> that transcribes each individual voice line in the game, cross-referencing them with their cue ID for anyone who wants to find a specific line in the game files.</p><p>Despite its age, Baldur's Gate 3 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-studio-reacts-to-the-game-awards-nomination-what-the-fk/1100-6536343/" data-ref-id="1100-6536343">been nominated for The Game Awards 2025</a>, picking up a nod for Best Community Support. Developer Larian Studios appears to be gearing up to announce something new at The Game Awards this year, with clues pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/" data-ref-id="1100-6536822">a new Divinity game</a>.</p>

            <p>Doom creator John Romero's cancelled game is back, with the developer stating the untitled project has "survived".</p>
<p>Following mass layoffs at Microsoft this summer, Romero Games - the studio set up by the Doom creator and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Soon after this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">Romero Games assured fans the studio had not been closed</a>, and the team was now on the hunt for a new publisher to handle its cancelled game. And, it seems a new publisher or some kind of deal was indeed found, with Romero recently stating the game had "survived cancellation".</p>

<p>Romero discussed the topic of his studio's cancelled game at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (see video below). Confirming it had been saved, Romero was met with waves of applause from the audience, before he shared a few more details about what we can all expect on its release.</p><p>"There's a really good 110 people working on the game," Romero said, adding it has "been basically completely redesigned". The studio's upcoming game has "nothing" to do with the previous game, he furthered, but "incorporates a lot of the elements" from it.</p>
<p>"We're not starting at ground zero," the developer said. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p>
<p>He added it is now a "much smaller game" than before, but it is "more fun" for the team as "the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn't actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that". Said Romero: "[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that's why small teams are great."</p>
<p>The developer still can't talk about the design specifics just yet, but said he has "never played a game like it" before. We do know that it is a shooter, though. "But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a very crazy place, and a different world, and it was really cool to explore it and be like 'what is that?'," Romero elaborated. "That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p>

<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romero-memoir-doom-guy-getting-not-one-but-two-screen-adaptations">Romero was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work</a>.</p>

<p>Puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a> launched on Switch last year, and we were particularly enamoured by it. Developer Wishfully quickly followed it up with the announcement of a sequel, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Children of the Leaf</a>', and the latest gameplay trailer promises it will be every bit as cute as we'd hope.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's Unity Awards Showcase, the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWoUwHXShgQ">Say hello to the Roller</a>' trailer introduces us to one of the many cute creatures you'll encounter on Lana and Mui's journey, one that possesses a particularly sticky set of skills.</p>
<p>Using Mui's transforming abilities, these cute fluff balls can stick to walls and ceilings, leave flammable trails, and roll along narrow corridors undetected. They are also really freaking cute, which is always a bonus — just try not to become too attached to them by the end of the trailer, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release date for Planet of Lana 2 just yet, though Wishfully and Thunderful have confirmed that it'll be coming our way at some point in <strong>early 2026</strong>. That leaves you a good bit of time to catch up on its predecessor, if you haven't already, which we described as "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan – perhaps even destined to join that short list of classics" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Three new trademarks which very much look to be related to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series have been unearthed, with one closely mirroring the design of a desert monolith Geoff Keighley's posted a picture of in advance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">The Geoff Awards</a>. That <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595">monolith teaser</a>, which Keoff captioned "regal.inspiring.thickness" has been the subject of much chatter for the past week or so, as the big showcase hype machine churns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">MP1ST</a>, who have spotted these three logo trademarks on the website of the European Union's intellectual property office. All were applied for in relation to video games on December 9th, by German law firm Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte. Larian Studios' name isn't mentioned in the filings, but that'd be the same law firm <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98397930">they used</a> when applying for <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129">previous Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">first of the trademarks</a> is the swanky new Divinity logo I've used as the featured image for this article, while you can check out the <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">other</a> <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288404">two</a> - which seem at a glance like they could be alternative logos - below.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EUIPO</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>The one on the left appears to mirror the 'eye with weird sticky outy bits' design of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisit/comments/1pgd9j2/sculpture_found_in_joshua_tree_where_is_it_from/">Geoff's mysterious monolith</a>. I think you could also reasonably describe Larian's Divinity games as having a regal, inspiring thickness to them.</p>
<p>That said, the studio's ever Tweeterly verbose publishing director Michael Douse was quick to reply to a user speculating about fresh original sin with <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">the following words</a>: "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we've been working on, we will." Further down in the thread, he also helpfully confirmed that Larian aren't working on or talking about a toilet simulator as of right now.</p><p>Regardless of whether these do turn out to be the harbingers of a Divinity loo experience, the timing and context seem to point to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers offering more info during the Geoff Awards. If you're keen to get in a suitably divine mood while you wait to see if that's the case, here's former RPS deputy editor and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-baldurs-gate-3-lead-writer-adam-smith">current Larian writer Adam Smith</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/divinity-original-sin-2-review">review</a> of Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <p>As someone staring down the barrel of untangling a box of Christmas lights, I won't lie, a not tiny part of me wants to throw them in the bin and replace the whole lot with a fresh set from the shop. (I must stress, I won't be doing that. But the urge still stands.) However, Restory is a cosy game that appeals to the better angel of my nature, the part that will patiently untangle the lights so they can be enjoyed for another year.</p>
<p>Restory sets you up as the manager of a small Tokyo electronics maintenance shop at the turn of the millennium. Customers bring you broken devices to painstakingly disassemble, clean, and replace their broken parts, restoring them to working order. Though you can also order broken devices and spare parts online using your delightfully dated PC.</p>

<p>The money you earn from your work goes on rent and bills, and paying for the licenses to allow you repair more complicated and valuable tech. Though, from my time with the demo, the management side of Restory is on the lighter side – you aren't going to be adjusting the prices to undercut nearby businesses or seeking out unofficial parts to restore devices, for instance.</p>
<p>Due for release in 2026, if you head over to Steam you can take part in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812600/ReStory_Chill_Electronic_Repairs/">Restory's first playtest</a>. I've spent an hour with the demo so far and I'm enjoying its mix of management game and simulator, but there are aspects that aren't quite gelling for me yet.</p><p>Restory's repair jobs, at least as I've discovered in the demo, are fairly simple. You disassemble a device. Slide broken parts straight into the bin under your workbench. Order new parts from your computer terminal. Clean the dirt, dust, and rust from the pieces that remain. Fit everything back together and return it to the customer. In a game about restoration, the items in your hands feel both disposable and interchangeable, even as the stories speak to the items being unique.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the joys of other restoration cosy games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assemble-with-care">Assemble With Care</a>, comes from fiddling with the innards of machines. Rotating camera mirrors, spooling tapes, connecting wires in an effort to diagnose the problem with the machine you're repairing. It may only be a slight puzzle to solve, but that connection with the kit in your virtual hands makes the action meditative. You contemplate the object in front of you.</p>
<p>Assemble With Care may be an unfair comparison, as you only encounter each of its objects once, making them unique within the game. Whereas Restory is a longer game in which you encounter the same device repeatedly. While the (off-brand) recreations of 2000s tech, such as a 'Pokia' 3310 and an 'Autorolla' Razor, initially inspired feelings of nostalgia, by the fifth time I was unpacking a handset that looked identical to the others that preceded it, the devices lost their lustre. If even the colourshemes of the phones or the tamagotchi were to vary it might make each repair job more distinct.</p><p>However, there is still a tonal mismatch between treatment of objects in Restory and its stories. In one, for instance, a security guard arrives at your store requesting you fix his flashlight. The torch is rare, he says, and important to him. So I buy another one online, strip it for parts and repair his flashlight to return to him. While he leaves happy, cannibalising one item to fix another seems at odds with the messaging of the game.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While broadly the customer stories are enjoyably told – such as the recluse who lives above your store, who communicates with you via messages and items lowered to your window in a plastic bucket – they don't all work so well. In the listing details of an off-brand Tamogotchi on the in-game auction site, a seller writes "It was my son's. I don't understand these things… Please don't let it die. I can't get my son back, but at least his memory lives on." What could be a poignant story, instead feels cheapened for its throwaway nature compared to the time lavished on the guard who wants his flashlight fixed. Especially as you can immediately strip the toy to pieces to distribute among other broken toys.</p>
<p>What is already on Restory's workbench made for a distracting hour, but hopefully between now and release it can gain a little more variety. There is a version of running a small electronics shop – buying, restoring, and selling items to meet rent and pay bills – that could be thoroughly absorbing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pc-building-simulator">PC Building Simulator</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, and Trash Goblin show how diverting these kinds of granular manual work can be. It's just not yet clear if Restory will become one of them.</p>

                <p>It's been a busy week for industry speculation after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">Geoff Keighley started posting </a>about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/">moved into Los Angeles</a>. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-mysterious-monolith-is-not-for-lords-of-the-fallen-2/1100-6536750/">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">all shot down</a> by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.</p><p dir="ltr">A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="4304" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211"></a><figcaption>The logos trademarked bear a striking resemblance to the monolith's imagery.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A recent PlayStation Store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">database leak revealed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> is getting a Definitive Edition release on the PS5, but it's likely that the statue and the new trademark filings relate to a brand new title in the Divinity series.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is not far away now, airing on December 11 live from Los Angeles. Despite being over two years old now, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 is up for an award again, earning another nomination for Best Community Support. This year's frontrunner looks to be Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which earned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-nominees-ranked-by-how-many-nominations-they-received/2900-7267/">record-breaking 12 nominations</a>.

            <p>New trademarks for the Divinity franchise have been spotted online ahead of The Game Awards, leading fans to believe the mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">Geoff's demonic statue in the Mojave Desert</a> has finally been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">mp1st</a>, trademarks for a Divinity logo and two icons have been <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">registered in Europe</a>. One icon, with its glowing orb and spindly leg design, certainly resembles the statue. Fans have therefore quickly jumped to the conclusion of Larian announcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 3 later this week.</p>
<p>Yet those hopes have been somewhat dashed by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse. "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity: Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will," he responded on social media.</p>

<figure>

<p>So what does this relate to? Douse's reply is in response to a leak of a PS5 Definitive Edition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, Larian's 2017 RPG it developed before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that released on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. "Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Douse.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>So does that mean the trademarks relate to this new edition of Original Sin 2? Or is Larian working on a new game in the Divinity franchise, just not Original Sin 3?</p>
<p>The Divinity franchise began with Larian's 2002 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, and has received seven entries so far.</p>

<p>Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke previously announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">studio's next game won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor will it be related to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It will be "still familiar enough, but different," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-will-have-different-tone-style-way-of-doing-it-to-baldurs-gate-3-but-wont-dwarf-it">Vincke told Eurogamer</a>, while the "tone, style, way of doing it, are for us certainly new - and I think very appealing."</p><p>It's unclear what Larian is working on next, though it seems a return to Divinity shouldn't be ruled out. Either way, following the phenomenal success of Baldur's Gate 3, the studio's next game is hugely anticipated - and certainly worthy of a demonic statue.</p>

<p>The change comes after this year's entry - Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, which succeeded 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">received negative feedback from critics and players</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">concerning sales reports across the industry</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog post shared last night, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">the Call of Duty team</a> - which includes studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> and Raven Software - acknowledged that the franchise had "not met" many players' expectations in recent times.</p>
<p>"With respect to Black Ops 7, we set our sights to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 and the studios have poured their passion into making a great game that all of us are very proud of. But it's one thing for us to say it, more importantly it's up to you to try it and judge for yourselves," it said.</p><p>As such, the Call of Duty team is going to be making some adjustments to its strategy from now. First off, it is opening up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-dark-ops-challenges">Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode</a> for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week. This is in order to allow anyone who has been on the fence about Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide" for themselves.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team is also committing to "unprecedented season support" for Black Ops 7, saying it "won't rest" until the game "earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we've ever made".</p>
<p>In addition, the studios said there will be no back-to-back releases of either Black Ops or Modern Warfare (which it did in 2022 and 2023) from now on.</p>
<p>"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year," the team wrote. "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p>
<p>It believes the franchise's future is "strong" and that its "best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent" of its development teams.</p>
<p>"We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the franchise and the genre forward," the blog closed. "We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together."</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 recently came under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was then brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to analyst Rhys Elliott and The Game Business' Chris Dring about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">why Call of Duty Black Ops 7 failed to hit the mark this year</a>.</p>

            <guid>1378087</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just surprised fans with the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch 2 platform</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, the game was already available to play on the Switch 2 for those who owned the Switch version, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated</a> in May 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-is-now-available-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in September 2022. However, this native version offers various technical enhancements.</p>



<p>The developer says that it takes 'full advantage' of the latest Nintendo console's hardware, including NVIDIA DLSS support:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing</li>



<li>Improved load times</li>



<li>Optimized performance</li>



<li>Joy-Con 2 mouse control support</li>



<li>Motion controls</li>



<li>Amiibo support</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the technical improvements, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is exactly the same as it was on the original Switch. Just like with that version, Nintendo users can enjoy three exclusive in-game items inspired by The Legend of Zelda franchise: the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Champion’s Tunic. New users can purchase the game for $59.99, while existing Switch users will be able to upgrade to the improved version for free.</p>

<p>Beyond that, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the same content as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it first released</a> on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on November 11, 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the original game's launch. </p>



<p>That means the official expansions released by Bethesda Game Studios (Hearthfire, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn), as well as the following Creation Club items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adventurer's Backpack</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Mail</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Plate</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Dragon Plate</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Dragonscale</li>

<li>The Gray Cowl Returns!</li>



<li>Tundra Homestead</li>



<li>Umbra</li>



<li>Vigil Enforcer Armor Set</li>



<li>Wild Horses</li>
</ul>



<p>That's the extent of the additional content you can get on the Nintendo Switch 2 (or the Nintendo Switch, for that matter) in Skyrim Anniversary Edition, since the game does not support the Creation Club menu on Nintendo's consoles, unlike PlayStation and Xbox consoles and, of course, PC. </p>



<p>By the way, if you've been hoping to see Skyrim's successor pop up any time soon, Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that The Elder Scrolls VI is still 'a long way off', and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will launch after GTA VI</a> in any case (meaning in 2027 at the earliest). </p>

<p>Use these Roblox Midnight Chasers monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and more.</p>



<p>Midnight Chasers is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-catch-a-monster-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that immerses players in an exhilarating street racing experience where speed and skill determine a player’s success. Unlike most Roblox games, in Midnight Chasers, gamers drive supercars, hypercars, bikes or regular cars — weaving through traffic, cutting across highways, or just cruising and showing off their ride. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate racing machine and test your driving prowess against friends or other players in high-speed competitions.</p>







<p>The more races you win, the better rewards you earn, which will help make your vehicle collection even more impressive. Because there’s a wide selection of vehicles, Midnight Chasers offers replay value. Thus, progression in Midnight Chasers revolves around collecting and using the game’s main currency: Cash. It’s the main resource within the game and allow players to purchase new vehicles and upgrades that can be used to enhance their racing capabilities. Thus, while these currencies can be earned during regular gameplay, redeeming codes will help give players a leg up.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-midnight-chasers-codes">How To Get More Midnight Chasers Codes</h2>



<p>Midnight Chasers codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes Midnight In-Dev’s X account, as the team drops codes during game milestones and updates. However, keeping tabs on the various sources can be time-consuming, especially when there is no notification system in place when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Midnight Chasers codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

<p>Is Larian's popular role-playing series back?</p>

<p>It's ignited plenty of speculation online, and now a trio of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity</a> trademarks, which were filed in Europe on 9th December 2025, appear to confirm it's an announcement related to Larian's popular role-playing series. As you can see below, the symbols match the statue:</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the news this week of a PlayStation 5 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</a> being added to Sony's servers. Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse responded to this, mentioning how the team <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">wasn't "meant to announce that yet"</a>. Douse has also supposedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/">ruled out Divinity Original Sin 3</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/mystery-game-awards-reveal-is-a-new-divinity-rpg-as-riddle-is-finally-solved">our colleagues at Push Square</a> note, this could even be a "double-header" of announcements including "a re-release of Original Sin 2 on new-gen consoles and a fresh announcement for the franchise".</p>
<p>If we hear anything on the Nintendo front, we'll let you know. Larian previously released Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on the Switch eShop in 2019 (<a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/010027400cdc6000">and it's compatible with the Switch 2</a>), but we're sure many fans would embrace a next-generation upgrade.</p>
