		<p>Even though it’s the shortest month, it’s been a little surprising just how quickly it feels like February has raced by. We’re just a few short days away from the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and I know that’s one that series fans have been salivating over for a long time – and not just for the in-game chef’s creations!</p>
<p>But MHW is still in the future, what about in the here and now? Well, the week’s two biggest releases (full releases, not pre-order shenanigans releases) are the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Are you playing either of these this weekend?</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you been playing this week? Well…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww</strong> has been playing a bunch of backlog games and titles that were soon to leave the PS Plus catalogue. That included The Outer Worlds, though this was too old fashioned, and he started Life Is Strange 2. He also got The Shapeshifting Detective, which didn’t speak to him, and he played Call of the Sea with his daughter, but got a little stuck on a riddle.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Could Have Been ‘Multiplayer Skyrim’ Before a Reboot Happened]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-multiplayer-skyrim-before-reboot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-could-have-been-%E2%80%98multiplayer-skyrim%E2%80%99-before-a-reboot-happened.1116135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-multiplayer-skyrim-before-reboot/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Avowed hit the market just a few days ago, and players worldwide have been getting to grips with Obsidian’s latest ambitious RPG. This semi-open-world title boasts sumptuous visuals and an innovative story, plus all the trappings of a fantasy RPG that we’ve come to expect over the years.</p>



<p>The single-player marvel could have been something entirely different, though. In a recent report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was revealed by Carrie Patel, the game’s director, that Avowed started life as an MMO that was dubbed ‘multiplayer Skyrim’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-might-have-been">What Might Have Been</h2>



<p>Given that the industry’s MMO category is well and truly oversaturated these days, I’m rather thankful that Avowed took on a fresh form following a dramatic reboot.</p>



<p>In a recent report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=copy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Bloomberg</a>, Obsidian’s Carrie Patel explained that a 2021 pivot led to a total reboot of Avowed, which had until then been designed as a multiplayer title. The game was preparing to enter production in earnest, but Microsoft’s acquisition of Obsidian took a drastic turn, and a relatively large team was ordered to shake things up.</p>



<p>Patel expanded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Normally if you’re stepping back and reevaluating your creative direction, putting together a new vertical slice and revised production plans, you would do that with a very small team. </p>



<p>We did not have a very small team at that point.</p>



<p>A lot of lessons we learned as we were building this game, ideally we would’ve learned on a small scale with a true preproduction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a further twist, Avowed’s open-world model was switched out for a ‘zone-based’ structure akin to 2019’s The Outer Worlds. This has since been reviewed by Avowed’s development team, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-not-open-world-because-zones-tough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been pretty public on the reasons</a> for that creative and logistical decision.</p>



<p>Patel wrapped the interview with Schreier by signing off with a nod to the future of the Avowed label:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that we’ve built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I’d love to see us do more with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you happy that Avowed is a single-player RPG, or would you have preferred an MMO? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-could-cause-the-closure-of-%E2%80%98more-than-a-dozen-studios%E2%80%99-report-claims.1116132/</guid>

<p>Earlier this week, we reported on the layoffs that had hit the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase. In one sweep, an entire department in North America was laid off, despite the rampant and ongoing success of Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Now, a fresh report published by Game File’s Stephen Totilo has expanded on NetEase’s current situation. The gaming titan has been in a sticky spot of late, and studios it has opened or invested in have started to experience layoffs and closures, such as Liquid Swords, which this week also announced redundancies.</p>



<p>Per Totilo’s report, the devastation is yet to unfold in full, and ‘more than a dozen studios’ could be facing closure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-review-and-evaluation">‘Constant Review and Evaluation’</h2>



<p>In Game File’s most recent report, it was stressed that NetEase’s cuts aren’t ending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/liquid-swords-the-next-studio-to-hold-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liquid Swords</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-ceo-debated-having-marvel-rivals-canceled-and-removing-heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Marvel Rivals team</a>.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was stressed by Stephen Totilo</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years—two people familiar with the company’s efforts tell Game File. Neither individual was authorized to speak about NetEase’s plans publicly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those sources have claimed that NetEase wants to divest ‘overseas teams’, an action that could lead to the closure of more than a dozen game studios around the world. The situation would be exacerbated if these studios can’t secure funding once ‘dropped’ by NetEase.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, NetEase neglected to comment on these insider reports, but it was mentioned that the company and its studios are ‘in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made.’</p>



<p>In a one-year window, Embracer Group laid off more than 4,500 employees and brought about the closure of 80 projects, as well as shutting down some prolific studios. This NetEase situation could mirror that to some extent. </p>



<p>The Chinese company is the fifth largest game firm by revenue, sitting just behind Nintendo and a step ahead of Electronic Arts. It collectively employs around 30,000 people, which represents a concerning amount of ‘fodder’.</p>



<p>I’m most concerned about Rebel Wolves, which NetEase invested in back in 2022. Recently, the Polish studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/">revealed Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, an intriguing title pieced together by former Witcher developers. That could be one of the studios impacted by these changes.</p>



<p>For now, everything remains up in the air.</p>

<p>In a recent leak published on social media by eXtas1s, fresh references to the ‘new Xbox controller’ were uncovered. These details gel nicely with what we already know about the ‘Sebile’ controller that was leaked in the FTC vs. Microsoft documents almost two years ago. If nothing else, this new update is a testament to the controller <strong>still existing</strong>.</p>



<p>Per the update posted by eXtas1s, dataminers have uncovered references to the ‘Sebile’ controller in new XCloud files. It was originally thought that the upgraded, next-generation controller would be released alongside whatever console comes next, but these latest details suggest it could arrive sooner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-sebile">What is Sebile?</h2>



<p>In September 2023, the FTC vs. Microsoft court case led to many documents being publicly revealed, with some outlining the future of Xbox hardware and peripherals. One such peripheral that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-new-xbox-controller/">was fully unveiled was ‘Sebile’</a>, otherwise dubbed ‘the new Xbox controller’ by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the documents suggested it would have a ‘lift to wake’ feature, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/">precision haptic feedback</a>, better ergonomics, and a rechargeable battery as standard. It was also stressed it would have seamless connectivity mechanics, better accessibility for repair and disassembly, and an accelerometer.</p>



<p>In a recent post published on <a href="https://xcancel.com/extas1stv/status/1893094238549590287?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media by eXtas1s</a>, those very same features are discussed again. In recent XCloud files uncovered by dataminers, references to the following were found:</p>



<ul>
<li>Codenames: Sebile_Delgado, Sebile_EV1B, Actium_Duet, Actium_EVO</li>
</ul>



<p>EXtas1s expands on the codenames by reiterating the proposed technical specification:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Modular with improved haptics, similar to the DualSense. Goodbye to batteries, now with a rechargeable battery. Gesture to ‘wake up’ the controller. Part of the console renewal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While the tech specs seem to be nothing more than a look back at what we already know, the modern references to the codenames in the XCloud files are new and are more or less confirmation that Microsoft is still working on Sebile.</p>



<p>Are you eager to see this modernised, enhanced Xbox controller surface? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Pokemon fans are known to be passionate, especially as Pokemania nears its 30th anniversary in 2026. Sometimes, fans are even willing to pay shockingly high prices for unofficial Pokemon items, including--of all things--a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that bears more than a little resemblance to Charizard. "Cheetozard" recently went up for auction, and the highest bid has already cleared four figures.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/526839/cheeto-charizard-auction-pokemon-collectibles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this Charizard-shaped Cheeto is currently available to anyone with a large amount of expendable income <a href="https://goldin.co/item/cheetozard-pokemon-charizard-shaped-cheeto-370g3p?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOTEzN2RlNjJiOWFiM2Y0ZmFjNzQxODkyYzFkZmI1ZWMiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjd9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Goldin auctions</a>. At press time, the highest bid is $2,100, and there are still eight more days before the auction comes to a close.</p><p>According to the auction description, Cheetozard was "discovered and preserved sometime between 2018-2022 by 1st &amp; Goal Collectibles." It comes with a custom-made Cheetozard card inside of a clear storage box. It's a very amusing novelty item, but probably not for everyone.</p><p>Next week, The Pokemon Company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-february-27/1100-6529609/" data-ref-id="1100-6529609">be hosting a Pokemon Presents Livestream</a>, and fans have already speculated that the franchise's next Switch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, will be featured. Meanwhile, Pokemon Go developer Niantic is reportedly in negotiations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">to sell its gaming division to Saudi Arabia's Scopely</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date "03.04.25." Now, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.</p><p>The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he has been in contact with Activision</a> about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the long-running franchise will continue</a>.</p><p>If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer</a>. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. Hawk has obviously moved on to better accommodations since then, but we're eager to see where the video game series can go with the full power of the current gen consoles.</p>

The tabletop publisher's digital event was packed with new board game announcements and ongoing support for various beloved franchises. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The RenegadeCon 2025 Board Game Announcements</h2>

<p>During a Twitch livestream, Renegade Game Studios began RenegadeCon 2025 with new board game announcements. They were then collected into a <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/renegade-con-february-2025-reveals-recap/" rel="nofollow">recap blog post</a> on their official site.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monsters-menace-the-world-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=dz7PIUJd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monsters-menace-the-world-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=ffDpO25k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first board game announced was <em>Monsters Menace The World</em>. A game where two to four players play as gigantic monsters as they terrorize the world and gain infamy. In addition, each player controls a Military faction dedicated to slowing down the monsters' rampage. Whoever has the most infamy wins. It is currently available for pre-order at an MSRP of $55. The game will be released in June.</p>

<p>The second RenegadeCon 2025 announcement is a new twist on an old classic. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> has players join either GI Joe or Cobra as they complete missions across a world map. There are multiple twists on the Risk formula here, including a focus on completing multiple objectives instead of world domination. <em>Risk GI Joe: Special Missions</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $70.</p>

<p>Third is a revised edition of the board game, <em>Sentient</em>. One to four players play as cutting-edge robotics companies. You'll compete against one another calibrating AI networks, and striking deals with investors, all to kick off the sentient robot revolution. This update to the 2017 original release includes a new solo mode and an updated game board. Sentient is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $40.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skara-brae-board-game-renegadecon-2025-cover.jpg?itok=7QNo5Dwo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skara-brae-board-game-renegadecon-2025-cover.jpg?itok=cQycCMBM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who enjoy more survival-focused board games, RenegadeCon 2025 has you covered with <em>Skara Brae</em> by Garphill Games. This game is set in the Orkney Islands of ancient Scotland. Players must gather resources to feed, clothe, and shelter your growing number of settlers. <em>Skara Brae</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $60.</p>

<p>Another Garphill Games project announced was <em>The Anarchy</em>. This Medieval-themed board game is set after the death of King Henry I with players in the role of nobles loyal to the swiftly inaugurated King Stephen de Blois. During this chaotic era, Players must build their domain, defend their castle from attack, and storm strongholds loyal to Empress Matilda.</p>

<p>Whoever proves they are the most brave and loyal to King Stephen wins the game. <em>The Anarchy</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $65.</p>

<p>Of course, RenegadeCon 2025 wouldn't be complete without new material coming to World of Darkness.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade Rivals</em> is getting a second Royalty Pack (MSRP $15), commemorating winners from past Prince of the City tournaments. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-reveals-werewolf-apocalypse-fifth-edition-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse</em></a> V5 is getting a new sourcebook, <em>Wyrmtide</em>, packed with new player options, story seeds, and enemies. <em>Wyrmtide</em> is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $45.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/werewolf-gift-and-rite-deck-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=ROQIB8AO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/werewolf-gift-and-rite-deck-renegadecon-2025-card-artwork.jpg?itok=oXEg5CMu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, <em>Werewolf</em> players can pick up a pack of convenient <em>Gift and Rite</em> deck. This deck contains all Gifts and Rites from the <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse Core Book</em>, the <em>Storyteller's Toolkit</em>, and the <em>Shattered Nation</em> sourcebook. The <em>Werewolf: The Apocalypse Gift and Rite</em> deck is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $25.</p>

<p>Lastly, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em> TTRPG</a> is getting a new supplement based on the <em>Transformers One</em> feature film. It will contain new player options and locations based on the feature film, including playing as Bots looking to gain their own T-Cog, alongside new threats and locations on the surface of Cybertron like the Iacon 5000. The <em>Transformers One</em> supplement is available for pre-order for $40.</p>

Reading between the lines, the suggestion is that even if Nagoshi’s next game does make it out the door, it won’t get the red carpet rollout fans would hope for, or a new IP might be needed in order to have a chance of standing out in an ever more crowded field. </p><p>NetEase  acquired Grasshopper Manufacture, the studio behind cult-hits <em>Let It Die</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netease-games-acquires-goichi-sudas-grasshopper-manufac-1847914966">back in 2021 as well</a></span>.

That said, we'd expect the gamified alarm clock to pop up at other major retailers soon, including Walmart, Target, and GameStop. It's possible Amazon will sell it, too.

So far, Nintendo has added two more games to the lineup via free post-launch updates: Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p>In total, there are over 40 scenes that can be watched on the screen when the corresponding tracks from the game pull you out of your slumber. You can opt for the volume to increase over time.

The built-in motion sensor lets you snooze your alarm with a gesture or a button press (it's your choice). Nintendo characters from the games above can also respond to motion-detected gestures.</p><p>Throughout the day, Alarmo can be used to remind you what time it is by setting it to play music at specific intervals. It can also track your sleep and let you know how often you're tossing and turning, which provides a general idea of the quality of your sleep.</p><p>Alarmo is powered with the included USB-C cable. While it doesn't work wirelessly, the included coin battery saves your settings, so if you need to move the clock to another room or your power goes out, you can plug it back in without needing to set it up again.</p><p>Nintendo plans to release more updates, including new scenes, for Alarmo in the future.
