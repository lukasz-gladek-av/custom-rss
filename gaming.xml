      <div><p>Capcom has announced a new sales milestone for flagship survival horror games&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, as well as new figures for several other games in the series.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/dev1_official/status/1915685807085805921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>has hit ten million sales, which means the game has managed to pick up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">between January and now</a>.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil Village</em>, meanwhile, has crossed the eleven million mark. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million line</a> in June last year, so it's taking a little longer to pass those milestones than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but that's still a pretty impressive performance nonetheless. Capcom also shared this cool artwork to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=gUj5eoPl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-artwork.jpg?itok=a3LFXN3V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games have reached big new sales milestones.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to these two figures, Capcom also announced new milestones for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3</em>, although it's harder to tell whether these are sales figures or player counts, given that both games are available via Xbox Game Pass right now.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 7&nbsp;</em>has also passed the 15 million mark according to Capcom, but again, since that game has historically been available as part of Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, it's hard to say whether the figure refers to sales or simply player count.</p>

<p>In any case, the figures show that Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>franchise is still going strong, so hopefully, it won't be too long until the next installment of the franchise is revealed.</p>

<p>Roughly five years passed between the release of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 6&nbsp;</em>and the semi-reboot&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, and a further four years went by until&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>arrived, so by that logic, we should be getting fairly close to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 9&nbsp;</em>reveal, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=nJJvdwfR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-4-sales-scarecrows-village.jpg?itok=RxuF1k5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely, the successor to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>is coming soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Until then, however, the various&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games are available across pretty much all platforms, so you can pick your poison when it comes to survival horror.</p>

    <p><span>Run an amusement park in Fontaine.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.6 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Paralogism,” will launch on May 7, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-961236"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update features a new Archon Quest Interlude chapter, leading players to Mondstadt where an unexpected storm brews. Meanwhile, a new amusement park opens its doors in Fontaine, challenging players to manage its operations with both wisdom and courage. Two new characters will also join the adventure: Escoffier, the former chef of Hotel Debord who can whip up delicious dishes with ease, and Ifa, a seasoned sauro-vet who fights alongside his saurian companion, Cacucu.</p><p>In the latest Archon Quest Interlude, players’ joyous return to Mondstadt during the Windblume Festival takes a sharp turn for the worse as an unexpected trial places Albedo in the crosshairs of all. Travelers will find themselves thrown into an investigation and more alongside Venti, familiar faces from the Knights of Favonius, new allies like Dahlia, as well as the Hexenzirkel’s very own Lady Alice.</p><p>As danger looms beyond the courtroom, signs of a greater threat begin to emerge with monsters invading the city. In a key negotiation with Lady Alice, Travelers must undergo a magical trial to secure her support and defend Mondstadt from the encroaching darkness. The mage’s trial arrives as a new Weekly Boss Challenge, unfolding in a dramatic battle upon a mystical chessboard. Face the King and Queen, uncover the secrets of the board, and prevail against this onslaught of powerful foes!</p><p>A brand-new management gameplay event is coming to Fontaine: The Chevalmarin Film Fantasyland, starring Navia alongside familiar faces from Fontaine and Natlan as you work together to run an amusement park. Through managing three main attractions—Eclectic Escapades, Movie Masterpieces, and Mellow Manor—players can grow their park by upgrading facilities and improving Service Value by recruiting and training employees. Along the way, helpful “Friendly Encounters” and even a local chef may offer valuable management techniques or buffs. Clever use of Action Points during each business cycle is key to maximizing revenue and unlocking Performance Rewards, including the exclusive 4-star bow, Sequence of Solitude.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>But Fontaine is home to more surprises yet! Players will soon cross paths with Escoffier, a new 5-star Cryo polearm wielder and the former head chef of the famous Hotel Debord. Her combat style blends culinary flair with elemental power. Escoffier’s Elemental Skill allows her to summon the All-Spectrum Multi-Use <a title="Genres > Cooking [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a> Mek, which can either stay in place to absorb Elemental Attacks and prepare food items, or follow the active character to serve up continuous blasts of Cryo DMG. Beyond dishing out damage, Escoffier also brings reliable support to the table. Her Elemental Burst heals allies, and both her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst reduce enemies’ Hydro and Cryo RES, an effect that strengthens with more Hydro or Cryo teammates.</p><p>Another new playable character is a familiar face from Natlan: Ifa, a new 4-star Anemo catalyst user from the Flower-Feather Clan who soars into battle with his Qucusaurus companion, Cacucu. This skilled sauro-vet can rain Tonicshots on his foes while healing teammates, and summon a wind current that pulls in enemies to control the battlefield. While in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Ifa boosts Swirl and Electro-Charged DMG based on the party’s Nightsoul Points. With his sharp medical instincts, Ifa can also automatically heal the active character when their HP falls below a certain threshold, ensuring his team stays healthy and strong in the heat of battle.</p><p>In Version 5.6’s Event Wishes, Escoffier, Navia, and Ifa will be part of the first phase, followed by Kinich and Raiden Shogun in the latter. Meanwhile, this version will bring back the Chronicled Wish, this time featuring various 5-star characters from Inazuma.</p><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> Version 5.6 will lead to another chapter of the main story, and let players run an amusement park starting from May 7. </p></blockquote><div id="carousel_961237"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,995 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed a new piece of trivia about his PlayStation game Death Stranding. He said on a social media post that he offered Margaret Qualley a role in the video game after seeing her in a Kenzo perfume ad back in 2016.</p><p>The ad was directed by Oscar-winning director Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Her), and in it, Qualley dances in a variety of contorting positions. "The only note I got from my agent was that they wanted me to dance like a tree," <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/how-margaret-qualley-auditioned-for-spike-jonzes-kenzo-ad.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Qualley said of the ad</a>, which you can see below.</p><p>In Death Stranding, Qualley plays Mama and Lockne. It's unclear if Qualley is coming back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. </a></p><p>Qualley's stardom has grown since 2019's Death Stranding, as she played one of the leads in the Oscar-nominated movie The Substance in 2024. She's also known for her roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the TV series Maid. Among her numerous upcoming projects is Happy Gilmore 2.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 launches at the end of June on PS5, with Kojima directing. Lately, Kojima has been busy <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1915711243488285041" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing the game ahead of release</a>. Kojima Productions recently held a media event where members of the press got a chance to play it, and impressions will be posted online this May. </p>

            <p>
The developer behind acclaimed indie role-player Tenderfoot Tactics has removed the game from sale on Xbox, and said the decision was made to support a growing Palestinian-lead boycott of Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
"We have removed Tenderfoot Tactics from sale on Xbox in solidarity with BDS [Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sonofbadru.bsky.social/post/3lngim3mjzc2x">Tenderfoot Tactics developer Badru wrote on social media</a>. "We call on others in our community to do whatever they can to fight this historic injustice. Free Palestine."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, the Palestinian BDS National Committee added Microsoft to its list of companies flagged as having links to the Israeli military. In Microsoft's case, <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the BDS Movement states</a> that the maker of Windows and Xbox has provided Azure cloud and AI services "central to accelerating Israel's genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip". Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
The BDS Movement has subsequently issued a call for a boycott of Microsoft products, including Xbox specifically, as a visible way to pressure the company. Its website suggests cancelling your Xbox Game Pass subscription, and avoiding key Microsoft-owned franchises such as Minecraft, Call of Duty and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>.
</p>
<p>
"By boycotting the Xbox brand, we're pressuring Microsoft to end its complicity in Israel's genocide, occupation and apartheid against Palestinians," the BDS Movement states. "Palestinians call on everyone to boycott Microsoft's Xbox and Microsoft gaming products since viable gaming alternatives exist. Genocide is not a game."
</p>
<p>
Other companies listed by the BDS to be boycotted include computer manufacturer HP, and Reebok, which sponsors the Israel Football Association.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-protest-employees-fired-israel-gaza-50th-anniversary-c5b3715fa1800450b8d0f639b492495e">AP reported earlier this month</a> that Microsoft had swiftly fired two employees who interrupted a presentation on AI held during the company's 50th anniversary celebration to protest links to Israel.

Fans can look forward to more news to come in the coming months.</p><p>Even though Skate is currently only available in a closed playtest, the game has microtransactions.

"If a new area is added to the game world, you can access it for free," the studio said.</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle claimed it won't lock "cool" items behind a paywall as an incentive for people to spend money. While the in-game rewards system is still being worked out--including what people can buy with real money and earnable in-game currency--Full Circle said "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash."</p><p>The new Skate was first announced in 2020, with series veterans Deran Chung and Cuz Parry--creators of the original games--returning.

At the time, Nintendo shared pre-orders would be happening the following week, but it had to pause those plans in the face of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">Trump's ambiguous tariff plans</a>. After some time, however, Nintendo made public that pre-orders would begin today, April 24, and that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-demand-outpaces-nintendos-expectations-and-supply">demand was already exceeding supply</a>.</p>

<p>Which lead to last night, at 12 p.m. ET, when pre-orders at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy officially opened. Many of us here on staff were at the ready, credit cards in hands, to secure our consoles. Some of us were successful. Some of us were not, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lnknfbsobs2f">some of us fell asleep</a>.</p>

<p>But what about you? Were you able to pre-order a Switch 2? Did you not even bother trying? Are you perfectly happy with your Steam Deck and have no plans to get a Switch 2? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

Raiders of Blackveil is said to combine elements from MOBAs, RPGs, and PvE extraction titles to deliver a strategic action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with up to two friends.</p>

<p>In Raiders of Blackveil, you fight through a dystopian future in which a mega-corporation, Blackveil, oppresses the industrial-fantasy world's animals. Players join the animal rebellion working to take down the company and preserve a future free from enslavement and mindless consumerism.</p>

</article><p>The Copenhagen-based studio has been developing Raiders of Blackveil in secret for the past two years with developers who have worked on series like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and Kane &amp; Lynch on the team.&nbsp;Flösser, who is CEO of Wombo Games, served as chief creative officer at Square Enix during development of games like Hitman's first season, Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, Deux Ex: Human Revolution, and Thief. He also worked on Hitman: Absolution, Hitman: Blood Money, Freedom Fighters, and more in managerial roles.</p>

<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finaly be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,"&nbsp;Flösser said in a press release. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in Early Access later this year."</p>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is scheduled to launch into Early Access this coming summer.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has stated its upcoming reboot won't have an offline mode.</p>
<p>This is because "the game and city [known as San Vansterdam] are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox", and both are "always online and always evolving".</p>

</figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">recent column by the developer</a>, Skate players will notice changes to San Vansterdam itself as time goes on, as well as "smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities". And, so the studio can deliver on its vision, Skate will "always require a live connection".</p>
<p>Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's playtest, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard.</p>
<p>In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the playtest's microtransactions. As reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>"We know that using real money during a playtest is a little unusual, but we think it’s the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch," Full Circle said today.</p>
<p>"If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spent during playtesting in San Van Bucks (SVB) when we reset for Early Access launch."</p>
<p>As to when we will all be able to get our hands on Skate, Full Circle remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although it hasn't shared a more specific date as yet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>. On its eventual release, it will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss-incredible-results-540p-to-1080p/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS support for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be a massive game-changer for the upcoming system, as the AI upscaler is already delivering impressive results upscaling low base resolutions to 1080p.</p>
<p>In a recent hands-on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> going over the system and both first and third-party games, the tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to try out the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6, among other games. The game is the first taste of a game powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine on the system, and it seems like it delivers on all fronts, sporting stable 60 FPS gameplay in docked mode with some visual cutbacks in line with those featured in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S versions over the others. More interesting, however, is that the game is not running at native 1080p resolution as early analysis of the available footage suggested, but at 1080p resolution upscaled from base 540p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS. Given how clean the image looks, this is extremely impressive.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter 6 Nintendo Switch 2 port is not the only impressive third-party port that will launch with the system in a little over two months. Much like the CAPCOM game, Cyberpunk 2077 has also been<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> confirmed</a> to use a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. The upscaler is reportedly used for all the game's display modes in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">exceptions</a>. You can learn more about the new system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">report.</a></p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 launches on April 29th, which is also when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Steam release</a> will happen. It's not clear whether the game will support crossplay between platforms, however.</p>

<p>Co-op supports two players, and you can "explore the entirety of Miraland, including the brand new Sea of Stars area" with a friend in tow. You can also teleport to your fellow Stylist, take photos, and "enjoy all-new interactions" as part of the co-op mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=cSr3pbrQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=s93mLdeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 brings a new co-op mode and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Version 1.5 is also known as "Bubble Season", the update is also introducing new bubble-themed co-op challenges to take on.</p>

<p>These will involve teaming up to "use bubble props that generate bubbles in different colors to reveal hidden paths", as well as "protecting a fragile bubble as it travels along a winding path" and working with your co-op partner to keep it safe.</p>

<p>You'll also find lots of new stuff on Serenity Island, which has transformed into "a fantastical playground brimming with floating bubbles and celebration". There, you can ride a Bubble Gondola, use a new outfit to "create soaring water columns for traversal", and more.</p>

<p>Of course, this being an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new outfits, including two new five-star sets and five free outfits, one of which is "legendary fan-favorite" Sea of Stars. The new dyeing system will also let you change outfits' individual colors and create custom color schemes.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. The game's 1.5 update, Bubble Season, arrives on April 29th, as does its Steam version.</p>

And he’s put it to good use in his 20-plus year career, playing everything from a flying ball of fire in <em>Fantastic Four</em> to a fireman-turned-revolutionary running through fire in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, with a bunch more ass kicking in between. So, when he pulled off playing twin vampire and savior in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646"><em>Sinners</em></a></span>, it wasn’t surprising when the biceps came out, the bullets started flying, and undead punches were swinging. That’s just what Michael B Jordan does.</p><p>As we all collectively bask in Jordan’s Oscar-worthy performance in the year’s best film, it’s appropriate to look back at the most physically badass roles in his career.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s almost nothing redeemable about <em>Fantastic Four</em>—except for the fact that Michael B. Jordan somehow turned a flaming CGI mess into a showcase of raw, physical swagger. As Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, Jordan isn’t just tossing fireballs or flying through collapsing debris; he’s <em>owning</em> every chaotic second with the kind of athletic command usually reserved for action heroes in better movies. Between landing with thunderous force after mid-air combustion and confidently walking out of infernos like it’s just another Tuesday, Jordan makes you believe that setting yourself on fire might actually be cool if you’ve got the abs for it. The movie might crash and burn, but MBJ rises from it like a fireproof phoenix—cocky, kinetic, and built for the heat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Running through fire, smashing through walls, and igniting more than just books, Michael B. Jordan’s turn as Guy Montag in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is a slow-burn kind of badass. You don’t expect a dystopian fireman-turned-revolutionary to be this physically commanding, but Jordan makes rebellion look like a contact sport. Whether he’s barreling through surveillance drones, sprinting across flaming streets, or wrestling with his own morality as violently as he does his enemies, his body moves like a weapon sharpened by rage and purpose. It’s not the kind of superheroic muscle-flexing you see in <em>Creed</em> or <em>Black Panther</em>, but it’s every bit as intense—just cloaked in ash, smoke, and the weight of dismantling a broken system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t usually think of a fighter pilot role as a physical showcase, but Michael B. Jordan made sure his turn as Maurice “Bumps” Wilson in <em>Red Tails</em> hit different. Right out the gate, he’s throwing hands in the barracks, turning a playful scuffle into a display of fast fists and sharp footwork that shows he’s got more than just pilot skills. Once he’s in the air, that energy doesn’t let up. He’s yanking the controls like he’s in a street brawl with gravity, barking into the radio while dodging enemy fire, and pulling G-forces like it’s personal. In one brutal dogfight, Bumps takes a hit and nearly blacks out—but Jordan grits through it, clutching the stick like it’s life or death, sweat pouring and muscles flexed. Even when he’s grounded, he’s all tension and twitchy readiness—pacing, punching the air, never still. Jordan was a fighter in every sense of the word.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Televsion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment in <em>Friday Night Lights</em> where Vince Howard takes off on a broken play, jukes two defenders out of their cleats, stiff-arms a third into the turf, and dives headfirst into the end zone like it’s life or death—and in Howard’s world, it kind of is. It’s in scenes like that where Michael B. Jordan’s physicality erupts. As one of his few true sports roles, Howard captures the raw athleticism Jordan brought to <em>Friday Night Lights.</em> It wasn’t just football; it was survival dressed in pads. And Jordan made sure you felt every yard he earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jordan’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798">Killmonger</a></span> yelling “Is this your king?” is forever embedded in the collective consciousness of everyone who’s seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772"><em>Black Panther</em></a></span>, because it’s a declaration of dominance he backs up with every ounce of muscle and menace in his performance. From the moment he enters Wakanda, he moves like a man who’s trained for war his entire life—because he has. Every strike is calculated, every fight brutal, whether he’s dismantling T’Challa in ritual combat or walking through Wakanda’s royal court with the swagger of someone who’s already won. Coogler expertly weaponizes Jordan’s physique, making every flex and clash of spears feel like a reckoning. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-recommend-id="image://a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1250" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Across three films, he doesn’t just play a boxer—he <em>is</em> one, chiseled out of grief, grit, and legacy. Whether he’s hammering tires in back-alley training montages or trading blows with human tanks in the ring, Jordan’s body looks war-ready. And under Ryan Coogler’s direction, every punch, flex, and sweat-drenched stare tells you this isn’t just about titles—it’s about identity, redemption, and proving he’s more than Apollo’s son. This is Jordan at his most locked-in, most lethal, and most legendary. Putting on a performance worthy of being attached to the <em>Rocky</em> legacy is one of the highest honors any badass actor can receive.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-recommend-id="image://e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-format="jpg" data-width="2707" data-height="1353" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

As twin brothers  Elijah “Smoke” Moore and Elias “Stack” Moore in Ryan Coogler’s magnum opus horror flick <em>Sinners, </em>Jordan wasn’t only body slamming, shooting and leaping over waves of blood thirsty vampires, he was also taking bullet shots, rumbling, and trying to sink his teeth into...himself. Coogler made sure you could see his bulging biceps as he unloaded rounds of ammo onto racist Klansmen to reinforce the notion that Jordan’s characters were built to do battle with the evils of the world, because survival is the only way they’ve known how to live. Whether you see <em>Sinners</em> in the panoramic brilliance of IMAX 70mm or on your phone, you’ll recognize that Michael B Jordan is a badass regardless of the era.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-fans-are-saying-nintendo-could-learn-a-thing-or-two-from-bethesda-when-it-comes-to-video-game-prices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has become something of a lightning rod for the ongoing debate around Nintendo’s pricing for the Switch 2 and its games, with some fans saying the company behind Mario could learn a thing or two about video game pricing from Bethesda.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>. Bethesda, however, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>has explained why it went down the remaster route</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The base Oblivion game costs $50 and includes all the DLC originally released. It’s an impressive, high value package, and for many it makes Nintendo’s Switch 2 game pricing look even worse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare and contrast, as many are doing, Oblivion Remastered to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which costs $70, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which costs an eye-watering $80. There’s a $10 upgrade path for existing owners of the OG Switch versions, and Nintendo Switch Online subscribers can upgrade for free. But Nintendo’s standalone pricing here has sparked a backlash online, especially when you consider the jump to $80 not only for Tears of the Kingdom, but for a number of other Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it gets worse for Zelda. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN has confirmed that Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not come with the Expansion Pass</a>, which means you have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the Switch 2 if you don't already own it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild comes with improved visuals and performance, achievements, as well as support for the new "Zelda Notes" service in the Nintendo Switch Online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild on the Switch, you won't get those features automatically; you need to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition to gain access.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t own the game, you can buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at (so basically the price of the original game and the pack). But it won't include the DLC Expansion Pack, so if you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. That makes $90 total for the full Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping $90 for the most current version of a game that came out in 2017 on the Wii U <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo"><u>feels painful</u></a>, especially in light of Mario Kart World retailing at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy"><u>unheard-of $80</u></a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 itself costing $450</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here we have Oblivion Remastered, which some are saying is good enough to be called a remake, with all the DLC thrown in for $50. You can see why Nintendo is coming out poorly in the wake of comparisons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Oblivion, a full-blown Unreal Engine 5 remake is $50 and its also on Game Pass Ultimate</p><p>Zelda Breath of the Wild Switch 2 edition is $70 with a few enhancements...</p><p>I dont know how anybody can defend Nintendo for its Switch 2 game prices <a href="https://t.co/7d6VGSlBgc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7d6VGSlBgc</a></p></div>— JayWood2010 (@JayWood2010) <a href="https://twitter.com/JayWood2010/status/1914707600731431055?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo will look at them and say ‘those guys could have made $30 extra,' " <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6rvcp/nitendo_can_learn_from_bethesda/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joked redditor Cultural_Writing2999</a>. "It's hard for them to learn much of anything over the sound of all that money being printed," geldonyetich added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This response taps into the idea that Nintendo is charging what it’s charging for Switch 2 because it knows people will pay for it.

Since this has indeed been listed as a "starter" set, we do expect more could be announced in the future, along with more amiibo figures , of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My Nintendo Store only offers free delivery on orders over £20. So, if you were initially going to buy one of the TotK amiibo, you can also buy either one of the full Switch 2 edition games or upgrade packs in the catalogue above, to get you over the threshold and save yourself some extra money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> has now sold more than 10m copies, and has managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the series to date.
</p>
<p>
Capcom trumpeted the sales milestone for its spruced up survival horror classic this morning, though revealed its Resi 4 Remake had actually topped that figure as of 31st December last year.
</p>
<p>
That means the game has shifted 10m in less than two years, having first arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2023.
</p>
<p>
Updated sales figures for other previous Resident Evil releases show Resi 7, which released back in 2017, is now up to 15m. Capcom's Resi 2 Remake, released back in 2019, is now also up to 15m.
</p>
<p>
More recent launches such as 2020's Resi 3 Remake and 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> have also continued to sell, and stand on 10m and 11m units respectively.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">press statement on these updated figures</a>, Capcom described them as evidence it had "successfully executed its long-term catalogue sales strategy".
</p>
<p>
The Resident Evil franchise has now sold a combined 167m units since its first entry released in 1996, Capcom also noted. What's next? Capcom has said it will continue remaking older games alongside newer launches. So, would you prefer Resi 5 or a Code Veronica Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">alongside your Resident Evil 9</a>?
</p>
<p>"Keeping what works while reimagining what doesn't, this is about as good as remakes get," Aoife Wilson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-review-a-classic-comes-back-to-life">Eurogamer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Elder Scrolls 4's 'duplicate items glitch' is alive and well in Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted">Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda recently said it only wanted to remaster Oblivion</a>, rather than remake it, to ensure players were experiencing the same game they remember playing back in 2006, but with the benefit of today's technology.</p>
<p>And the Oblivion team has indeed remained faithful with its remastering efforts, even including the original's duplicate items cheat (or, glitch, if you prefer).</p>

<p>This Oblivion glitch is a handy and, let's be honest, welcomingly easy way of doing things compared to the more conventional and long-winded method of getting multiple tools and such as you make your way through the fantasy world.</p>
<p>This glitch can be used for items such as arrows or even, for those money hungry players among us, gold.</p>
<p>As our Marie has discovered, the duplicate item glitch in Oblivion Remastered works <em>slightly </em>differently compared to the original game, but it's still very doable, as it is only really the control commands that have been changed up a bit.</p>
<p>If you too are working your way through Oblivion Remastered, but could really do with a few more of a certain item and simply coming across it organically isn't working out for you, you can find out how to use this glitch to your advantage in our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-use-duplicate-items-glitch-oblivion-remastered">How to use Duplicate Items glitch in Oblivion Remastered</a>. This guide covers Xbox, PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a> even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod that is now available for download for free addresses one of the game's most glaring issues.</p>
<p>The mod, which was developed by well-known modder Lyall, removes the 30 FPS cap in cutscenes, which is highly distracting when playing the game at higher framerates. The mod also fixes ultrawide resolutions FOV issues and introduces a few other features and improvements, such as the option to skip intro logos, enable the developer console, and disable letterboxing and pillar boxing in cutscenes. The mod, whose installation is quite simple, requiring the user only to drop the downloaded files into the game's folder, can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/ClairObscurFix">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game featuring a fascinating Belle Époque-inspired fantasy world, a charming cast of characters voiced by some incredible talent like Ben Starr, who previously voiced Clive Rosfield from Final Fantasy XVI and, more recently, general Khazan from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, and Jennifer English, who previously voiced Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3, and a turn-based combat system featuring some real-time elements like timed-button presses for increased skill power, dodging and parrying, that make confronting enemies extremely fun. The debut game from Sandfall Interactive is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also available as part of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/"> GeForce NOW service library.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>movie, for which several studios were apparently engaged in a bidding war last month, has gained a new star and two pretty big-name writers.</p>

<p>According to a new Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow">first mooted in March</a>, will star <em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and <em>Immaculate</em>'s Sydney Sweeney. Variety says which of the two leads Sweeney will be playing is "undecided", although it seems fairly obvious to me that Zoe is the right choice, given Sweeney's resemblance to the character.</p>

<p>Additionally, the movie's script is being written by&nbsp;<em>Deadpool and Wolverine&nbsp;</em>scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, according to Variety. The duo's other credits include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zombieland&nbsp;</em>and 2023's&nbsp;<em>Ghosted</em>&nbsp;(although let's hope they're using the former rather than the latter as inspiration).</p>

Chu, whose name you might know from movies like&nbsp;<em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical&nbsp;<em>In the Heights</em>, and last year's&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>.</p>

<p>This is the second video game-based movie with which Sydney Sweeney has been associated this week. On Tuesday, it was reported that Sweeney is working alongside Michael Bay on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the Sega racing classic&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's also one of several movies based on video games that are currently in the works, alongside the likes of Dread's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>, Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">based on popular card game&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, headed up by Josef Fares. The game stars Mio and Zoe as two writers who must begrudgingly work together to battle a (very literal) corporate machine that plans to steal their ideas.</p>

			<p>Breath of Fire IV, the fourth entry in the classic JRPG series developed by CAPCOM, is now available on PC via GOG, complete with plenty of enhancements over the original PlayStation release.</p>
<p>The newly released PC version of the game, which launches 25 years after the original released on the first PlayStation in Japan, is now available for the price of $9.99 / €9.99 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> and comes with improvements over the PlayStation release and the original PC release that launched in 2003, such as full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, 2 localization options (English and Japanese), new rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more), improved audio engine, improved keyboard and mouse support, fixed combat and cutscene scripting issues, full support for modern controllers and more.</p>
<p>The JRPG franchise by CAPCOM has been dormant for quite some time, so hopefully the Breath of Fire IV PC release will be successful enough to show the publisher how there's still interest in its series. Lately, CAPCOM has been bringing back series that were thought to be dead, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a> series, so a new game or a proper remaster of some of the older entries in the series, like my personal favorites, Breath of Fire III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, may not entirely be off the table.</p>

The metropolis of Tokyo is a bit different from what we know, but the streets are just as nostalgic, or, depending on where you’re from, they’re just as good as the place you’ve always wanted to visit.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Companions / Atypical Vehicles</strong></p><p>Autonomous drones, affectionately called “Companions,” have been integrated into daily life, but in cop terms, they’re referred to as “Atypical Vehicles”.</p><p>When they pose a significant threat to society, it’s time for the Atypical Vehicle Disposal Squad (AVDS)—a special unit of the Nitro City police force—to commence their mission to destroy all rogue vehicles!</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">Shoot ‘Em Up</a>!</strong></p><p>Good news: you can bring as much ammo as you want… and that includes grenades!</p><p>After just a little bit of cooldown, the lightning bolt of destruction will return to your hands. Ah, how wonderful! Just like magic!</p><p><strong>Gadgets and Gizmos</strong></p><p>Tired of traditional grenades? Why not try out the EMP, damage-dealing radio-controlled drones, auto-firing turrets, flamethrowers, anti-tank missiles, and more? There’s sure to be at least one out of the 12 different cool gadgets that’ll catch your eye.</p><p><strong>Understand Your Guns</strong></p><p>By assuming a more stable shooting position, your bullets will hit targets more accurately and deal more damage.</p><p>You can shoot some guns like SMGs while walking without caring about that, since they’re for close-range anyway, but the bigger the gun, the more it’s affected by your positioning. Stand still and aim carefully to use them properly.</p><p><strong>Large Armored Targets</strong></p><p>Oh no! We’re under attack by tanks and helicopters! Whatever can we do~?!</p><p>Rifles and SMGs don’t do much to armored targets. You could totally stick with them and show them your perseverance, but you could hit them harder where it hurts with more powerful firearms and gadgets.</p><p><strong>Radio Comms</strong></p><p>Story dialogue in stages are all contained in the police radio comms, which can be accessed at anytime and are completely optional. Which means you can ignore them completely if you want.</p><p>Great for multiple playthroughs, or for people who think the story sections of video games are basically the same as the instruction manual of an electric toothbrush.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Nitro Express（ナイトロ エクスプレス） - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRRS2CsrR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
