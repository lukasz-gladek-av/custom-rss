While I can’t yet confirm or deny whether <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> has <em>that </em>much content (I would <em>love </em>to have 300 spare hours to find out), I can say that Omega Force’s latest title almost certainly won’t leave you wanting for stuff to fight.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196884" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="196884,196646,195207" data-current="196884"><div><p>Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>My first playthrough took a little over 40 hours to complete.

There’s technically a short prologue chapter too, but it’s only a single tutorial battle to get your feet wet with the combat. Every chapter is roughly equal in terms of length, though you may wind up spending the most time in Chapter Three for reasons I’ll explain below.</p><h2 id="h56578"><a id="story"></a><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>has three branching story paths</h2><figure id="" data-id="dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-recommend-id="image://dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

This is standard <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>stuff, so that part shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. From here, you can engage with the three factions on a freelance basis like you’re someone who writes online professionally. But unlike someone who writes online professionally, one of your employers will eventually want to hire you full time. This will lock you into a unique story path for the remainder of Chapter Three, and that will persist into chapters four and five.</p><p>Several unique stages are locked behind each branching story path. Following my first playthrough, my stats indicated that I had only completed 50% of the missions in the game. In other words, there’s a healthy amount of replay value here, which brings me to my final point.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-recommend-id="image://eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You’ll surely want to see how those other story paths play out, and <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>gives you great tools to do just that. Here’s everything you’ll unlock once you start your postgame file.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You’ll gain the ability to freely replay any battle in the game, including optional missions you might have seen and initially missed. Additionally, you can restart the game from the beginning of any chapter <em>and </em>before any battle that leads to a new story branch depending on how you complete it. Yes, there are branching paths in the branching paths!</li><li>Your level cap will get a permanent increase, adding extra levels to each weapon for you to gain.</li><li>An extra weapon type can be found in the postgame as well, which is so insanely strong that it’s worth the insane amount of cash it costs in the shop. I won’t reveal <em>exactly </em>what it is, but it’s a very fun piece of fan service.</li><li>On top of the new weapon type, a stronger grade of weapons enters the pool too. You can purchase these outright, or you can find them in basic story missions. </li><li>Also, you can upgrade your weapons! This should be familiar to <em>Warriors </em>fans, but you can use spare weapons to both pass on useful traits or bestow raw power upgrades to your favorite armament. This does cost money though, so make sure you don’t blow through your reserves right off the bat.</li><li>Finally, an all new difficulty level is unlocked in the postgame. This changes fundamental rules of the game to skew things in your foes’ favor, but your rewards after each battle will dramatically increase. Also, you’ll find new optional challenges in several battles on this difficulty that will grant powerful new equipment and items upon completion. Do note that this difficulty is <em>really </em>intended for high level players, to the point that you’ll be dramatically underleveled for it even after a full playthrough. You’ll likely need to level up by playing through the other story paths before you challenge the game on this difficulty.  </li></ol><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>could very well require a triple digit number of hours before you accomplish everything it has to offer.

But that aside, if we’re judging solely on how long a game can divert your attention away from doing your dishes, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is a solid package as-is. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games rolled out a survey designed to poll Escape from Tarkov players on a variety of topics. In the last few weeks since the most recent wipe hit the game, players worldwide have been suffering under the weight of performance issues, network problems, bugs, and of course, vast swathes of cheaters plaguing the game.</p>



<p>The BSG team revealed that details and results from the most recent survey will be shared online in due course, but for now, they’ve pledged to ‘actively work to resolve’ the key challenges everyone is facing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-promises">Big Promises</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1881773608764092783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games explained that ‘several technical updates’ are set to hit Escape from Tarkov in the ‘near future’, correcting problems such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issues causing FPS drops and stuttering in various locations</li>



<li>Issues that caused complete sound loss during raids</li>



<li>Instances where sound was not correctly played indoors</li>



<li>Fixes for issues when loading into a raid as a Scav</li>



<li>Issues where players couldn’t interact with the Lightkeeper due to incorrect spawn points for the Zryachiy and his guards</li>



<li>All causes of invisible bot spawns in raids</li>



<li>Visual adjustments aimed at correcting fog effects on various locations</li>



<li>Issues with item availability and in-game trader quests</li>



<li>Issues where players would receive empty crafts in the “Cultist Circle” module of the Hideout</li>



<li>Client freezing when posting an offer on the flea market for an item found via the “Linked Search” function</li>



<li>Adding a graphics settings parameter: “Disable frame limit in-game when Nvidia Reflex is turned off”</li>



<li>Incorrect functionality of the Cyclone “Shahin” 3.7x thermal scope.</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans were quick to jump on the post and suggest further changes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>Among the suggestions sat topics like new spawn locations and loot routes on certain maps, more intricate mechanics in the Hideout, and adding more features to PvE that <strong>are not </strong>included in the ‘offline’ mode.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains the most popular extraction shooter in the world, even if it is suffering with more than a few issues at present. As always, the cycle will continue – players will start dropping off now to enjoy other games, but by the time the next wipe arrives, they’ll be gearing up to come back.</p>

<p>As Black Ops 6 surfaced last year, rumours started circulating online regarding the potential revival of DMZ. It was noted by some Call of Duty leakers that DMZ – the failed extraction shooter mode – would be returning in Call of Duty ‘2026’, but since then, the leaks have run relatively silent.</p>



<p>Earlier today, TheGhostOfHope stressed again on social media that DMZ is coming back with whatever Call of Duty game hits the market in 2026.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-raid">Time to Raid</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s DMZ mode was released alongside Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0 in 2022, and it quickly became a fan-favourite game mode. In DMZ, players were tasked with entering Al-Mazrah, completing tasks, securing loot, killing enemies, and then extracting again without being wiped out.</p>



<p>It was a good enough mode, but the content train faltered very early on and it was ultimately discontinued before it had time to shine. It doesn’t help that it was overshadowed by the bigger and more impactful players in the extraction shooter space like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>On Twitter (X), TheGhostOfHope posted a ‘small leak on the TL’, claiming:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DMZ returns as third gamemode in COD2026</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By ‘third gamemode’, the leaker is referring to the mode that sits alongside the campaign and traditional multiplayer offering. In Black Ops 6, that’s a full-fledged COD Zombies offering.</p>



<p>DMZ was a unique enough mode in the Call of Duty space, giving players a massive battle royale map to explore like never before. It empowered users to team up, as well – PvP combat wasn’t the default way forward, and players were even <strong>punished </strong>for killing other raiders. </p>



<p>Do you think DMZ coming back would be a win, or is it a waste of time? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The Microsoft Edge Game Assist feature is a widget that appears in the Game Bar in Windows 11 much like Valve’s Steam overlay browser. It’s also game-aware, so it can detect games you’re playing and offer up tips and guides in a little side panel.</p><p>The Game Assist overlay was previously restricted to beta users, but it’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/01/21/expanding-microsoft-edge-game-assist-preview-to-edge-stable/">now available in the stable version</a> of Microsoft Edge. If you want to enable the in-game browser you can open up Microsoft Edge and go to Settings and more &gt; Settings and then search for Game Assist and install the widget. The Game Assist feature will then be available in the Game Bar, which can be opened with the Windows key + G.</p><p>“The initial preview of Game Assist offers contextual tips and guides for a selection of popular PC games while we optimize the experience based on your feedback,” explains William Devereux, senior product manager for Microsoft Edge. Microsoft has also added support for more popular PC games, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“We’ll add tips and guides for even more popular games throughout the preview and over time,” says Devereux. “In the meantime, you can still use Game Assist to browse your favorite guides or other websites while playing any game.”</p><p>Game Assist works by using the same cookies, autofill, and favorites data from your main Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft has also added support for extensions like ad blockers to this Game Assist feature, and it’s planning to add support for keyboard shortcuts in the future, alongside an improved picture-in-picture experience and the ability to add a tab from Microsoft Edge to the sidebar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The pair would be co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios division. Then, in December 2023,<em> Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</em> landed in theaters as the last movie officially released as part of the Zack Snyder era of DC. The first project created by Gunn and Safran as part of the new DCU was the animated show <em>Creature Commandos</em>, which ended its first season earlier this month.

And the director and CEO of DC Studios explained that moving forward, only <em>Creature Commandos</em> is “pure canon.” Some older stuff, like his 2021 movie <em>The Suicide Squad,</em> could be considered an “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5nvtnk22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jamesgunn.bsky.social/post/3lg6v5nvtnk22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imperfect memory</a></span>” of what happened. Also, the 2022 show <em>Peacemaker </em>is “almost entirely consistent” with the new canon, but just ignore the scenes involving the Justice League at the end.</p><p>Okay, so let’s recap: What’s canon in the DCU? <em>Creature Commandos</em>, all the shows and movies that come out afterward,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-trailer-james-gunn-krypto-dog-lex-luthor-1851725124?_gl=1*xwqb6a*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ3NTczNC4xNDQuMS4xNzM3NDg1ODY1LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-trailer-james-gunn-krypto-dog-lex-luthor-1851725124?_gl=1*xwqb6a*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzQ3NTczNC4xNDQuMS4xNzM3NDg1ODY1LjYwLjAuMA.."> like 2025's <em>Superman</em></a></span>, and <em>some </em>parts of<em> Suicide Squad</em> and most (but not all of) <em>Peacemaker</em>. That’s it, right? Well, no. It gets more complicated! </p><p>In 2023, before <em>Aquaman</em>, DC released <em>Blue Beetle</em>. The movie was a massive box office flop and it isn’t part of the new DCU. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/blue-beetle-first-character-dc-universe-james-gunn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/blue-beetle-first-character-dc-universe-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But the <em>Blue Beetle</em> hero featured in the movie <em>is</em> in fact part of the DCU</a></span>, and the actor who played him will return in the future in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/06/blue-beetle-animated-series-dc-studios-1235973196/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/blue-beetle-animated-series-dc-studios-1235973196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animated series</a></span> that will reference the movie, but will be a canon adventure in the DCU. </p><p>Oh and speaking of confusing, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-peacemaker-season-one-isnt-canon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/james-gunn-peacemaker-season-one-isnt-canon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second season of <em>Peacemaker</em></a></span><em> </em>starring John Cena will be part of the DCU even though the first season is sort-of-but-not-actually canon. </p><p>To summarize: The DCU canon consists of <em>Creature Commandos</em>, all future DC movies and TV shows (except some stuff like <em>The Batman 2</em>), the Blue Beetle character but not the movie he appeared in, parts of <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, and most of <em>Peacemaker’s </em>first season but not really and all of its second season. Got it? Well, if not, just reread this thing or tweet at James Gunn. I’ve tried my best to explain it all and my head hurts so I’m going to go take a nap. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The results of the 13th annual State of the Game Industry Survey have been released, shining a light on how developers feel about all manner of hot-button industry topics, including generative AI.</p><p>The majority of surveyed developers (52%) said they work for companies that use generative AI, with 36% reporting that they personally use such tools for game development. While the majority of surveyed developers are working at companies that use generative AI, 30% of respondents said they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p><p>The survey also founded that Business and Finance roles (51%) were the most likely to use AI tools, with Production and Team Leadership (41%), and Community, Marketing, and PR (49%) following. What's more, the survey found that 28% of developers between ages 18-34 used AI technologies at work, compared to 47% for video game developers over the age of 55.</p><p>AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions. Video game actors also remain on strike, due in part to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">concerns about the use of AI. </a></p><p>Outside of AI, the State of the Game Industry study found that men make up 66% of the work force, down from 75% in 2020. Women and non-binary developers account for 32% of all game developers, up from 29% and 24% in the prior years. The percent of respondents identifying as LGBTQ+ was 24%, and white/caucasian developers accounted for 59% of the total game developer base in the study.</p><p>The study also touched upon industry layoffs, with the largest percentage (30%) saying they were not at all concerned about future layoffs. The study organizers said this surprising statistic might have to do with the number of "N/A" responses it got from developers who may have already been laid off. Layoffs in the video game industry were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">rampant in 2024 and have continued in 2025</a>.</p><p>Another data point from the survey found that PC is far and away the most popular platform for developers, with a whopping 80% of respondents saying they were currently making a game for PC. This was followed by PS5 (38%), Xbox Series X|S (34%), Android (29%), and iOS (28%).</p><p>The study also covered live-service games, with the biggest percentage (42%) saying they would not want to make a live-service title as their next game, with only 13% saying they would want to. The live-service game market is big and potentially lucrative, but it's also highly competitive. Sony recently made headlines for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">cancelling two more live-service games, including a God of War title</a>, following a strategic review.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250121745145/en/The-2025-Game-Industry-Survey-Reveals-Increasing-Impact-Of-Layoffs-Concerns-With-The-Usage-Of-Generative-AI-Funding-Challenges-and-More" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">State of the Game Industry study</a> was compiled from more than 3,000 developer responses, published and compiled in partnership between the Game Developers Conference and Omdia. The study is largely drawn from responses from independent and AA studio developers. Only 15% of responses came from AAA developers, down from 18% a year before.</p>

			<p>It's been announced today by Marvel Games and NetEase Games that a special Spring Festival event will be coming to Marvel Rivals. Since its release, this title has been widely successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">title already winning awards</a>. The Spring Festival will be coming to Marvel Rivals on January 23 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT, where a new limited-time game mode will be available for players to participate in.</p>
<p>This game mode is called Clash of Dancing Lions and allows players to participate in a 3v3 on a designated map to try and gain possession of the ball and get it over to the scoring zones that are on either side of the field. The first team to reach the designated score will be the winner of the Clash of Dancing Lions event.</p>
<p>By participating in the Clash of Dancing Lions event in Marvel Rivals, players will be able to get limited-time items such as the Star-Lord: Lion's Mane costume, nameplate, and spray. That is just the tip of the reward iceberg, as there is plenty more to unlock, including a Gallery Card customization event named Fortune &amp; Colors.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you can expect from the Marvel Rivals event, you can check out the Spring Festival trailer below, which showcases the Clashing Lions costumes. This includes Star-Lord: Lion's Mane, Iron Fist: Lion's Gaze, and Black Widow: Lion's Heartbeat. These costumes won't all be available to begin with, and will release over the following weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | The Spring Festival Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1ogvqoq09I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, Marvel Rivals will have a special Spider-Man 2 bundle, which comes with the Advanced Suit 2.0, nameplate, and spray, coming on January 30. This is to celebrate the launch of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 on PC.</p>
<p>The game has received three patches thus far, with the first season well underway. Players also got to experience Season 0 when the game was first released, which had just under half of the content that Season 1 currently has. Already there are many players flying through the ranks, with the likes of <a href="https://esports.gg/news/marvel-rivals/shroud-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shroud considering creating a Marvel Rivals esports organization</a> because he likes the game so much.</p>
<p>Whether that will come to fruition anytime soon remains to be seen, but as the game continues to remain popular, it's possible that this will become a staple in the esports genre amongst giants like Overwatch 2, Valorant, and League of Legends, for example.</p>

The news was <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019">shared on X</a> and featured a shout out to The Game Awards. </p><p>“To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards">@thegameawards</a>, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it!” the post read. <em>Balatro</em> was featured prominently during The Game Awards, nominated for a number of awards including Game of the Year and winning the best indie, best debut indie, and best mobile categories. </p><p>On X, Wout van Halderen, PR manager for <em>Balatro</em> publisher Playstack, added that the game had sold 3.5 million copies <a href="https://x.com/TheHashtag0nist/status/1881729707521257851">by the first week of December</a>. With The Game Awards taking place the second week in December, the implication is that <em>Balatro</em> received a significant 1.5 million unit bump in sales after being featured during Keighley’s Christmas Commercial telethon. Even more impressive, the 5 million figure is total units sold and doesn’t count the number of downloads the game got for being on the Apple Arcade subscription.</p><p>Since its launch in February, <em>Balatro</em> has quickly become one of the biggest indie hits of 2024. <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">Developed by a single person</a> over the course of two years, the poker roguelike has garnered a reputation for being a well-crafted “number-go-up” game with its developer leaning in on the joke that <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1839702508454687062">it devours players’ free and not-so-free time</a>.</p><div><p>In the 11 months since the game’s release, it’s only gotten small, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278578/balatro-is-getting-more-cards-featuring-other-games">cosmetic</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319769/dont-watch-this-balatro-video">updates</a> but developer LocalThunk has hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">a major gameplay-focused update</a> is forthcoming this year.</p></div><p>Jimbo help us all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A tooltip will eventually let you know that you can break boxes around the map to earn additional Materials, but by the time it gives you this information, you may have already passed up a handful of them. </p><p>So, hey, I just figured I’d let you know to <strong>keep an eye out for boxes with a glow around them</strong> because I’m a nice guy who wants you to be able to afford to buy the first Magic Vial from the Craftery, which will net you an extra Relic slot. You’re welcome. No, really, don’t sweat it.</p><h2 id="h655508"><a id="yolvan"></a>Put Yolvan to good use</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During the game’s opening hour or so, you’ll fight Yolvan and earn him as a Homunculi that you can equip. Since he fires projectiles, <strong>assign Yolvan to your shoulder button attack slot so that you can hold his attack down</strong> while you use melee attacks, too. This can massively improve the speed at which you deplete the Break Gauge of basic enemies, allowing you to pummel them into submission.</p><p>When the Craftery begins selling Mixed Parts (pretty early on), make sure to buy some and use them to <strong>purchase Yolvan’s Eviscerate ability</strong> to make him even more of a force to be reckoned with. Holding down the button for this ability will unleash a tornado attack that stuns several enemies at once while dishing out surprisingly good damage in the process. Since it can hit multiple enemies at once, it’s a pretty great upgrade over his basic attack in most scenarios.</p><h2 id="h655509"><a id="muninn"></a>Always keep Muninn out</h2><figure id="" data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll get Muninn when exploring the Magicite Mine. This Homunculi can be equipped and summoned to accompany you passively. Unlike most Homunculi, this means you don’t have to press any buttons to make Muninn attack. Instead, it will fly around behind you and occasionally auto-attack foes.</p><p>While this Homunculi doesn’t deal significant damage, it does help to chip away at the Break Gauge of your enemies without you having to micromanage any cooldowns or remember to press any buttons. </p><p>And, of course, if you’d like Muninn to bug off, just hit the assigned button again to send it packing. But, like, why would you not want the help? Are you too good for a friendly owl pal? Don’t be like that.</p><h2 id="h655510"><a id="helix"></a>Don’t miss the Helix Crystal Relic</h2><figure id="" data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll start the game with only a handful of replenishable healing wards, so a bit of passive healing sure would be nice, right? Luckily, you can grab the Helix Crystal early in the game, which will heal you for 3% of your total health every time you defeat an enemy. It may not sound like much, but there are a lot of enemies that are fairly easy to defeat along your path, so it certainly adds up. </p><p>When you’re ready to get it, play until you get the Lower Stratum Key a few hours in, then fast-travel back to the Abandoned Attuner Tent. Head left from the Abandoned Attuner Tent, and open the door to access the Magicite Mine. Inside, head down the slope and all the way to the left until you encounter a rather large foe. Defeat him and grab the Helix Crystal.</p><h2 id="h655511"><a id="difficulty"></a>Lower the difficulty if you’re struggling to git gud</h2><figure id="" data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Ender Magnolia</em> is designed to challenge you, it’s perfectly fine if you decide you’d like to reduce the degree to which it does so. Luckily, <strong>you can adjust the difficulty when resting at a Respite</strong>. You can opt to select from multiple presets, or you can manually adjust various aspects of enemy difficulty, such as health, attack frequency, and more. Do what feels right to you. I’m not here to judge.</p><hr><p><em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When was the last time you dove into Diablo Immortal? Following its bout of controversy upon release, namely, the egregious monetization practices that saw many spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on gems and power-ups for their miniature characters on-screen, I dropped the game. However, Blizzard has continuously updated and improved the experience since its launch. They recently dropped a few new updates, addressing player feedback. Here are the Diablo Immortal patch notes for the past week!</p>



<h2 id="h-january-bug-fixes-for-diablo-immortal">January Bug Fixes for Diablo Immortal</h2>



<p>The past few weeks have brought about a handful of bug fixes for Diablo Immortal that vastly improve the game through performance and gameplay tweaks. While they appear minor on the surface, these updates do make a difference!</p>



<h3 id="h-january-21"><strong>January 21</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would become immobile after entering a Wild Brawl match.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-january-14"><strong>January 14</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed minor visual issues in Westmarch.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed performance issues that caused crashes.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>UI</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where several bundles wouldn’t appear in the Shop.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players couldn’t interact with the Familiar Expeditions menu.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-diablo-immortal-worth-playing-now">Is Diablo Immortal Worth Playing Now?</h2>



<p>If you tried to play Diablo Immortal previously, specifically a year or so ago, then you’re probably a little jaded on the mobile ARPG. But if you’ve yet to try it, now’s an excellent time. At the end of last year, specifically in December, Blizzard pumped out a few updates that genuinely improved the game. There’s word the studio intends to reduce the overall cost of gems, too. That’s a huge boon to current and returning players.</p>



<p>If you don’t have a powerful computer or gaming console for Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2, then Diablo Immortal will suffice for the time being.</p>



<p>What’s your favorite class in Diablo Immortal? Let us know in the comments below, or visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a> to discuss the ARPG!</p>



<hr>



<p>If you do play Diablo IV, don’t forget to jump into the new season—Season of Witchcraft. You’ll find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-7-start-date-and-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start date and time here</a>!</p>

		<p>We love a good MOBA here at TSA Towers. Heck, we probably like the odd bad one too. One of the latest and greatest entries in the mega-popular genre is SMITE 2, the sequel to Titan Forge Games breakout hit. While it’s currently rumbling through an open beta launch, the team are adding new content virtually daily, getting it ready for its full launch, with the latest addition being a returning new god in the form of Cabrakan, and the Wandering Market, a bazaar where players can spend their hard-earned – or potentially hard-bought – Coins on new skins for their favourite characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="SMITE 2 Free-to-Play Open Beta Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTbb9B3UinQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Everything was announced at this past weekend’s SMITE 2 Founders Series event in Las Vegas. The Wandering Market will provide a rotating store for all players to access for free, with additional cosmetic items available via the paid, Premium Collection.</p>
<p>Players will be able to earn Coins to spend in the Wandering Market by completing quests and gaining XP each day. All those lovely Coins will be spendable across the various different collections released in the Wandering Market, so players will be able to save them up for future storefronts/sales as they play, and spend them whenever the mood takes them.</p>
<p>In turn, they shadow-dropped player-favourite Cabrakan into the sequel, delighting many long-term fans. Cabrakan, the destroyer of mountains, represents the Mayan Pantheon of Gods and uses earthquakes to disrupt and crowd control the opposition. We can’t wait to go hands on with him now he’s arrived.</p>

<p>While all this lovely information dropped, they also played a spot of competitive SMITE 2, with the first Founders Series Champions being crowned in Las Vegas when ‘Team Name but with 5 Ms’ beat Team Risk 3-2 in the finals, with BennyQ being crowned MVP. </p>

Having been bested by Sonic and friends twice in the previous films, the Egghead was going to have pivoted to talking to his adoring fans and promoting energy drinks that were probably not good for you.</p><p>There are two scenes that would have had Eggman interrupting the plot to stream to his followers. They contain some funny gags, such as Agent Stone enthusiastically spamming heart emojis on his boss’ stream because <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189">he’s clearly in love with him</a></span>, but still, it’s easy to see why these scenes were cut. In the context of the already busy movie, they likely would have just interrupted the flow and momentum of the action, and frankly, there’s already plenty of Carrey’s antics to go around (maybe too much). But seeing them now does contextualize one line that still made it into the final movie during Carrey’s final monologue.</p><p>At the end of the film, Eggman sacrifices himself to save Earth as he helps Shadow move the self-destructing Eclipse Cannon out of the planet’s orbit. But before he does, the doctor streams a goodbye message to Agent Stone after carelessly tossing him aside earlier in the movie. When he does so, he opens the stream with “This is Dr. Ivo Robotnik dedicating my final live stream to one very special henchman: Agent Stone.”</p><p>The use of the word “final” implies that there were others which, in the finished film, seems a little odd because we hadn’t seen Eggman streaming prior to this moment. While it makes sense that these scenes were deleted, the real shame is that we didn’t get to see Agent Stone yearning and nursing Eggman back to health after the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. Stobotnik shippers are not taking it well, but at least we’re seeing it now thanks to the digital release.</p><p>These scenes are fun to see, but the most interesting behind-the-scenes content coming out of Paramount right now are the new pieces of concept art which may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">answered some of the lingering questions from <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The standard version of both modes sees players compete in 3v3 soccer matches with a few unique twists that capitalize on their heroes’ abilities. Both obviously rip elements from Psyonix’s massively popular Rocket League, though, and it looks like the Marvel take on the blown-up soccer experience comes with a few differences, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, the limited-time mode seems to focus on at least three characters – Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow – instead of just one hero. The soccer ball also seems to be the size of your average, real-life ball, too, as players can be seen carrying it around the competition and to the goal. Marvel Rivals and Overwatch already <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-doesnt-stray-far-from-overwatch-but-its-super-fun-regardless">share more than a few things in common</a>, but it will be hard to say just how similar Clash of Dancing Lions and Lúcioball are until the Marvel event drops in a few days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Marvel Rivals Spring Festival event allows players to complete tasks for rewards, including the Star-Lord Lion’s Mane costume seen in the trailer. Additional details remain under wraps, but NetEase tells players that they’ll be able to earn other goodies, such as a nameplate, spray, and more, as part of the event. While the Iron Fist Lion’s Gaze and Black Widow Lion’s Heartbeat outfits were also shown off in the new video, the developers only tell fans to expect to see the three skins arrive in-game “in the coming weeks.”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Marvel Rivals news, players are still looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-gets-suit-from-playstations-spider-man-2-later-this-month">Marvel’s Spider-Man tie-in skin</a> set to arrive later this month.

This new set takes Wizards of the Coast's legendary card game into uncharted territory—the world of professional racing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any new Magic set, players will have new tools and mechanics to explore and build decks around. In <em>Aetherdrift</em>, these come in the form of “Speed” and “Exhaust.” First to the starting line is “Speed,” a new resource that players can accumulate when they play a card with “Start your engines!” which sets your speed value at 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can then increase their speed value once on their turn when they deal damage (combat or non-combat) to an opponent up to a maximum speed of 4. By reaching max speed, these cards will gain additional effects, but perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Speed is that, according to Wizards, once you gain it, it won’t decrease and you can’t lose it. While it takes at least three turns to reach max speed, getting a card with “Start your engines!” onto the battlefield as early as possible will be crucial. Additionally, while no specific cards were revealed, Wizards mentioned that some cards gain effects at different speed levels, not just max speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A good example is the new card <em>Far Fortune, End Boss</em>, which deals one damage to each opponent whenever you attack. However, if you are at max speed, it gains an additional ability: “If a source you control would deal damage to an opponent or a permanent an opponent controls, it deals that much damage plus 1 instead.” Since <em>Aetherdrift</em> features many artifact vehicles, <em>Mendicant Core, Guidelight</em> might inspire some deck ideas. Its max speed ability reads: “Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {1} (colorless). If you do, copy it (the copy becomes a token).” I can already think of a few artifact decks that could benefit from a card like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering Aetherdrift Preview - Key Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up is “Exhaust,” which is more straightforward but arguably more powerful. These one-time-use mana abilities compensate for their limited use with incredible versatility and game-changing effects. One of the previewed cards, <em>Redshift, Rocketeer Chief</em>, has the Exhaust ability: “{R}{G} and {10}: Put any number of permanent cards from your hand onto the battlefield.” Its default ability allows you to tap it to add X mana of any single color, where X is equal to its power. Considering that green is known for boosting creature power, you could easily empty your hand onto the battlefield with little trouble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real trick to maximizing the Exhaust mechanic will be in blink- or copy-heavy decks, allowing players to reuse these phenomenal abilities more than once. For example, recasting your commander with Exhaust or bouncing a card back to your hand will let you activate the ability again. Equipping an Exhaust creature with <em>Helm of the Host</em>, which creates copies with fresh uses of their abilities, could also lead to some truly devastating plays. However you approach it, I foresee plenty of headaches dealing with Exhaust in competitive games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Aetherdrift</em> sets itself apart from other original Magic sets with its unique art style and theme. Love it or hate it, the team has done a commendable job of making the set—and its mechanics—feel cohesive. I’m eagerly anticipating the full list of spoilers so we can get a better idea of just how versatile and widespread the new Speed and Exhaust mechanics will be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many decks will benefit from these abilities, but as with any new mechanic, it remains to be seen how much they will be incorporated into future releases. Sets like <em>Bloomburrow</em>, <em>Duskmorne</em>, and now <em>Aetherdrift</em> have redefined what an “original Magic plane” can be. While the racing aesthetic may seem odd or out of place to some players, for others, the bombastic visuals and vehicle-heavy theme might be exactly what draws them in. <em>Aetherdrift</em> releases on February 14—because nothing says romance like a new MTG set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

		<p>Unknown 9 Awakening has been deemed a failure by development studio Reflector, and plans to expand the series with more games, along with other multimedia ventures, have been cancelled. This news also means that staff at Reflector are going to be let go as the studio looks to move to a single project future, with back office staff being affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unknown 9: Awakening –&nbsp; Cinematic Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpO-jUWtm6E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Herve Hoerdt, CEO of Reflector Entertainment, said,<em> “Today, I informed our teams the decision to not greenlight further work on a future project that was in conceptualization phase and thus terminating this development line. Continuing the project would not have been sustainable for the future of the studio. Regrettably, this also means that there will be redundancies following the decision.</em></p>
<p><em>This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio’s ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe. The performance of the release didn’t come near the company expectations, after numerous timeline adjustments and investments, both financially and other, and didn’t warrant any further exploration in this universe.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately, this also affects back office staff, bringing the support teams in line with the single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future. Where possible, staff will be assigned to this project, based on an existing Bandai Namco IP, which is shaping up very well.</em></p>

<p><em>Reflector Entertainment will be providing adequate severance packages, extended health benefits for affected staff and families, continued access to emotional, mental health and counselling services and finally, proactive career planning support to set them up for future success. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe will continue investing on creating Western content for global audiences, in line with the Group’s vision.”</em></p>

<p>In our review for Unknown 9: Awakening, Nic said, <em>“I really wanted to write about the positives of featuring more cultures in this genre, and about how cool it is to have a famous actor play the protagonist, but sadly the gameplay gets in the way of anything interesting. Unknown 9: Awakening is just a bunch of gaming tropes loosely tied together with boring and uninspired NPCs lazily lurching from set piece to set piece, as the poorly designed game creaks and groans under the weight of expectation.”</em></p>
