<p>Get ready to kid the kids to the vacant lot. A new Backyard Baseball game is coming this year.</p>



<p>Playground Productions has officially announced a new Backyard Baseball game will launch in Summer 2026. It’s the first new game in the Backyard Sports series since Backyard Sports Baseball 2015 for iOS and Android. With a likely release for console, it would be the first for major platforms since Backyard Sports: Rookie Rush in 2010.</p>







<p>Details on the game itself weren’t revealed, but Playground Productions says that information will come in the near future.</p>



<p>To hold over until more news comes, Playground has released Backyard Sports: The Animated Special on YouTube. The nearly 12-minute show features an all-star cast of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ego Nwodim, Donald Faison, Adam Pally, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“In a high-energy new animated special from Playground Productions, the beloved 90’s video game franchise “Backyard Sports” returns as superstar Stephanie “Bubbles” Morgan is in crisis after losing her gotta-have-it, never-play-without-it lucky bubble gum,”</strong> the show’s description reads. <strong>“With just 30 minutes until game time, the Backyard kids embark on a wild, time-sensitive mission to track it down and save their season.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Straight to the End of the Line.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is 22 years old, which as you can imagine means that people have cracked that game wide open with weird glitches, skips, and tricks. Over the years, speedrunners have found ways to break San Andreas that got an any% speedrun of it down to a little under three hours, but recently an absolutely buckwild bug was found that cut that time down even further, to under an hour. Buckle up, folks, because this is one heck of a wacky speedrun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some context. San Andreas has been broken and rebroken many times over the years across its multiple versions, and there's one specific "trick" that's upended the speedrunning landscape multiple times. It actually originated in GTA: Vice City, where a <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/gtavc/guides/0h9mr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trick known as Script Stack Underflow</a> (SSU) was found that chopped an any% run down to around eight minutes. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-speedrunning-trick-sh-1838953554" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Way back in 2019</a>, San Andreas runners found something similar that they called "Arbitrary Jump in Script", or AJS, specifically in the Window Store remaster of the game. This overly-complex trick essentially let speedrunners jump straight to the end of the game by doing a long series of very specific things such as killing a drug dealer, parking a bike in a very specific place, answering the phone at very specific times, and diligently avoiding vending machines at all costs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While involved, it demonstrably worked, with the end result being the game executing a "JUMP" command to the start of End of the Line Part 3, the final mission. Ever since then the speedrunning community has had to split the category into any% and any% no AJS, because watching a run with AJS is fun exactly once and then you really just want to watch a proper, action-packed, multi-hour San Andreas speedrun. For a long time, this skip was limited to the Windows Store version of the game, though it was later found in the Definitive Edition remaster with some significant setup differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well now, speedrunners have figured out how to do AJS in the original PC version of San Andreas. It is <em>also</em> completely different in how it's set up, and is somehow even wackier than any of the versions that have come before. u/Vitosi4ek on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1qpv1ji/a_skip_the_whole_game_strat_has_been_found_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has a really nice breakdown of all the steps involved</a> (though some runners have already found ways to smooth out certain bits of it). These include: winning $10,000 on horse betting, making a clone of yourself, doing stunt jumps on a superbike, betting in the casino with negative money, changing your clothes, doing a dance minigame, running two Mission at the exact same time, and a lot more. All of this will hopefully, if the game doesn't crash, send you to the start of End of the Line Part 3, and let you finish the game right there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This glitch was literally just discovered, and in that time the world record run for an any% of GTA: San Andreas has dropped down to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zll2qkggyCU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">53 minutes and 46 seconds by creezyful</a>. It's very likely that this time will get even more shaved off in the coming days and weeks as speedrunners continue to optimize. This has also resulted in the community splitting any% off from any% no AJS, so audiences can still enjoy a roughly three-hour run of San Andreas and all the hyjinks involved in that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's wildly impressive to me that people are still managing to crack games this old open even more than they've already been, and make their guts do ridiculous things. Just this past AGDQ, I watched someone run arbitrary code execution in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, something I'm pretty sure they didn't know how to do the last time the game was at the show. Video games, man!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that does mean it'll probably be a long time before we get a run of GTA 6 that goes that fast. And that's if we can even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">make it to launch day this November</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Starting today, Amazon has dropped the price of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBAAb?object_uuid=a0d375b8-6481-4348-a869-c9ce41beeb48&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteelSeries Counter-Strike 2 Dragon Lore Limited Edition wireless gaming mouse</a> to just $56.76 after a massive 62% off discount. Historically speaking, the price of this mouse was fixed at $150 since it first released last July... until today. The Dragon Lore Edition gets points for its gorgeous design, but it also happens to be an excellent performer for any gamer looking for a lightweight mouse with top-of-the-line accuracy and precision.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition Mouse for $56.76</h2><div id="234911"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234911" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition Wireless Gaming Mouse</h3></p></div></span></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4Z6Z?object_uuid=a0d375b8-6481-4348-a869-c9ce41beeb48&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a> is offering 50% off the matching mousepad. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition is based off the venerable Aerox 3 wireless mouse but with a snazzy facelift. Instead of the "holey" honeycomb pattern, the CS2 Edition is kitted with a solid shell adorned with an intricate red and gold dragon illustration that replicates the legendary rare AWP skin in Counter-Strike. Art aside, I actually prefer the solid mouse cover; mice with a bunch of holes in its shells don't feel as sturdy, naturally, and accumulate dust faster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite losing the honeycomb shell, the CS2 Edition mouse is still very lightweight at 71 grams while still providing all the features you'd want in a premium gaming mouse. It can connect wirelessly two ways: over 2.4GHz WiFi with the dongle (the preferred choice for PC gaming) and Bluetooth. The PixArt co-developed 18K dpi "TrueMove Air" optical sensor offers true 1:1 tracking. The battery lasts up to 200 hours per charge. The mouse buttons are mechanical with a nice clicky sound and are rated for 80 million clicks. At under $60, this is a steal.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

      <p>It's perhaps the least surprising collaboration of 2026. Time Magazine (owned by<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykvypl9gxo?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Marc Benioff</u></a> and<a href="https://time.com/7339621/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects-choice/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>doing stuff like this</u></a>) has teamed up with Darren Aronofsky (already<a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-real-history-of-perfect-blue?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>well known for copying the work of others</u></a>) on an AI-generated web series about the American Revolution that finally answers the question nobody was asking: what if<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/coke-ai-holiday-ad?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>that Coke ad</u></a> had muskets in it?</p><p>Aronofsky is Executive Producer on the series <em>On This Day… 1776</em>--presumably because slop spat out by a mutated autocorrect doesn't need a director--and the way Time describe this thing is wild:</p><blockquote>If&nbsp;<em>On This</em>&nbsp;<em>Day…1776&nbsp;</em>manages to make the American Revolution feel like something that’s actually alive, it’s likely because the project has two things going for it. One is a new technology. The arrival of the U.S.A.’s semiquincentennial coincides with advances in artificial intelligence that leave behind sepia tints and costume drama and let storytellers generate a world that feels vibrant, richly textured, and immediate.</blockquote><p>You will not be surprised to learn that the series feels neither vibrant, richly textured or immediate. It looks like shit. Because it was made by a computer, and not a human director--even one as derivative as Aronofsky--every scene is cartoonishly ghastly. Objects and characters are unable to maintain their shape, and there are AI-generated irregularities throughout that nobody has either noticed or cared to remove.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdlfdingcc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiahklorddirvzg2qwnkcenkj3gbeukzoqd4oiw54vzsaf2jy56je4"><p lang="en">Finally we’ll see the story of how the nation of Aamerleda was founded</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Allosaur (@allosaur.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6/post/3mdlfdingcc2k?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-29T18:14:13.101Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>I don't want you to think you have to watch this.

The project also takes its “of-the-moment” feel from the headlines. In the first episode, dated Jan. 1, George Washington, visiting the hillside outside Boston where irregulars hold the high ground above British forces, asks them to shout out where they’re from. (You’ve never heard “Delaware!” proclaimed with more defiant pride.) And in the second installment, Jan. 10, Ben Franklin recruits Thomas Paine to articulate the overarching principles that can unite them. “Here in America,”&nbsp;<em>Common Sense&nbsp;</em>declares, “the law is king.”<p>In the story of how the United States of America came together for the first time,&nbsp;<em>On This Day…1776&nbsp;</em>has the cure for what ails us.</p></blockquote><p>The defining thing about AI today isn't the slop or the copyright infringement issues we've been facing for years, it's the increasing desperation with which it's being forced on us by an elite who knows we don't want it, but knows they need us to have it anyway so they can maintain the charade that their overcommitted tech companies are making a line go up.</p><p>Even by the standards of copywriting, even by the standards of self-promotion, what Time has written here has about as much credibility and basis in reality as a White House press briefing. <em>1776 </em>doesn't have the "cure for what ails us", it's just more of the same poison.</p><p>Oh, and for anyone who doesn't want to leave behind "sepia tints and costume drama", but does want to revisit the events of 1776 and watch some stuff made by humans, you should watch HBO's fantastic John Adams series if you haven't:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEtajI8Tmsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="John Adams | TRAILER  | HBO Films"></iframe></figure><p>Or, for a more recent and comprehensive retelling, there's Ken Burns' epic series:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lruEtNTN9oY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The American Revolution | A Film by Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein &amp; David Schmidt | Official Trailer"></iframe></figure>

              <p><span>Google has just started rolling out access to its new “experimental research prototype” Project Genie, an AI tool powered by Genie 3 and Gemini that allows users to create interactive, explorable worlds with a simple text prompt. Unsurprisingly, someone has immediately used it to generate a bunch of playable Nintendo knock-offs, including a </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </span></i><span>clone, complete with a usable paraglider. I’m sure that the famously non-litigious Nintendo will be absolutely chill about this.</span></p> <p><span>This news comes by way of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6ImZCakl0bmxFNGwiLCJwIjoiL25ld3MvODY5NzI2L2dvb2dsZS1haS1wcm9qZWN0LWdlbmllLTMtd29ybGQtbW9kZWwtaGFuZHMtb24iLCJleHAiOjE3NzAxNDAwNTYsImlhdCI6MTc2OTcwODA1OH0.q5OBTD_V36-65oc1EGqPxKYCZF00c7ODvifvagVcwbA&amp;utm_medium=gift-link"><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i></a><span> Jay Peters, who was granted access to Google’s Project Genie tool early, ahead of its official release for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the United States earlier this afternoon. Peters was able to craft playable reproductions of several famous Nintendo titles, including </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> and the aforementioned </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, as well as generating some odd amalgamation of </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>    <p><span>While it might not be immediately apparent in the videos that Peters provided, these Project Genie AI-generations are partially interactive, allowing users to move, jump, and, in the case of that </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> one, even paraglide. For the time being, the worlds that it generates are limited to minute-long, 24fps, 720p showcases.</span></p>

 <p><span>So, how is this legal? The short answer is that it isn’t, and Project Genie knows it isn’t.</span></p> <p><span>At one point during his testing, Project Genie stopped Peters from making any further </span><i><span>Super Mario 64</span></i><span> reproductions, out of concern for the “interests of third-party content providers.”</span></p> <p><span>He also came dangerously close to generating a playable version of </span><i><span>Kingdom Hearts</span></i><span>. Project Genie generated an AI-generated mock-up featuring Donald Duck, Sora, Cloud, and Jack Skellington before the process was cut off at the world generation stage. I would have absolutely loved to have seen the resulting AI platform vs. AI platform legal battle that may have spawned out of that, considering </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583"><span>Disney signed a $1 billion deal</span></a><span> to license its characters to OpenAI’s genAI platform.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Amazon's</strong> upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong> has officially found yet another cast member, and this time it's <strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll recognize from Apple's hit show <strong>Severance</strong>, who has been tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong>.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">Deadline</a>, but Wccftech readers who've been following our coverage of the show as casting ramps up ahead of a reported <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">March 2026 filming start</a></strong>, we already had our suspicions that Ólafsson would be picking up Mjolnir. A report from a website called <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> had previously identified Ólafsson for Thor, which has now been proven to be correct, after it had already been proven correct about casting for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Now that those three casting choices were proven to be more than just rumours, it gives more credence to the report's fourth casting rumour, which was that <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as <strong>Mimir</strong> for the show. As a fan-favourite character, keeping Duncan for the role of Mimir would go a long way with fans who remain unsure about the upcoming God of War adaptation.</p>



<p>Ólafsson now officially joins <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong>, and <strong>Max Parker</strong> in the cast, with Hurst being tapped to play Kratos, Palmer for Sif, and Parker for Heimdall. We still don't have a casting confirmation, or even a rumour for key roles like <strong>Atreus</strong>, <strong>Baldur</strong>, and <strong>Freya</strong>, but hopefully those will be revealed soon, if filming is still set to begin in March. </p>



<p>The show is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>, who signed on as showrunner after the original showrunners and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> had a falling out</a> in terms of the direction they wanted to take with the show.</p>



<p>While we still don't have concrete plot details for the direction the show will take, hopefully, some of the success that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/">Amazon's Fallout</a></strong> show has had will rub off on this upcoming God of War series. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-reports-162-quarterly-loss-as-bloodlines-2-write-downs-hit-hard/</link>
            <guid>1420270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/paradox-interactive/" id="199">Paradox Interactive’s</a> fourth quarter showed a sharp swing in profits. Revenue increased 23% from last year to roughly $99 million (MSEK 874.8), supported by sales from Age of Wonders 4, Cities: Skylines II, Crusader Kings III, and new releases Europa Universalis V and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p>



<p>Even with higher revenue, however, the company <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/latest-events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported an operating loss</a> of about $28 million (MSEK 245.4 , which is a 162% drop compared to last year. The main reason is Bloodlines 2, which did not meet sales expectations. </p>







<p>Paradox recorded write-downs and amortization of more than $77 million related to the game. That pushed the quarter from profitable to a significant loss.</p>



<p>Profit after tax fell to approximately $22 million, down from around $34 million last year. Earnings per share also turned negative, reflecting the impact of the Bloodlines 2 accounting adjustments.</p>



<p>Despite the hefty loss, Paradox remains financially stable. Cash flow from operations was about $56 million and the company ended the quarter with roughly $151 million in cash. That gives it room to invest in future projects and manage ongoing operations.</p>



<p><strong>“We are now strengthening our strategic focus, reallocating resources, and creating even better conditions for future investments where we have our greatest expertise and long-term potential,”</strong> CEO&nbsp;Fred Wester&nbsp;said.</p>







<p>For the full year, sales were largely unchanged at about $241 million, while operating profit dropped 80% to $16 million. Earnings per share fell from SEK 5.54 ($0.63) to just SEK 1.19 ($0.13).</p>



<p>The company also launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-europa-universalis-5-console-commands-cheats-how-to-enable-console-commands-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Europa Universalis V</a>, which the CEO described as an important step for the franchise. Paradox continued to release DLC and remasters for other titles throughout the quarter. The board proposed an ordinary dividend of 5 dollars per share, showing confidence in the underlying business despite the large quarterly loss.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/deadlocks-sleepy-new-hero-rem-is-a-perfect-little-guy/</link>
            <guid>1420255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Designing a hero in a game is a complex art task. Not only do you have to properly conceptualize the character, but also that character’s role in the game, how it matches the tone of the narrative, and how their design interacts mechanically with other characters. If you would like a masterclass in how to do this, simply look at Rem, the newest character in <em>Deadlock</em>, who is a sweepy widdle buddy who takes naps.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Deadlock </em>is technically still in early access, it has been humbly updating since Valve had to acknowledge its <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge/"><u>existence</u></a>. It is no longer the ugly duckling that is a bit difficult to place in the canon of Valve’s releases, but a gorgeously designed and fully realized Valve game whose influences from <em>DOTA 2 </em>to <em>TF2 </em>could not be more apparent. Last Thursday, Valve introduced the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playdeadlock.com%2Foldgods&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Old Gods, New Blood</u></a> update. It is one of the biggest updates to the game yet, one with huge quality of life and lore additions including a much less demanding 4v4 Street Brawl mode that is quick and great at easing new players into the game.&nbsp;</p><p>As with some previous updates, Valve is introducing several new heroes on a rolling schedule, and players can vote on which one is next. One of those characters stood out and, to nobody’s surprise, was the first to be rolled out. That character is Rem, a little owl/bat/fuzzy looking buddy who wears pajamas and a nightcap and holds a little candle out. His power is that he takes naps and throws his pillow.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Look at his little hideaway.</span></figcaption></figure><p>“An accidental stowaway from the world of dreams, Rem has found himself stranded in the city that never sleeps,” the update reads. “Pillow fights are Rem's preferred form of conflict, tossing his favorite pillow at enemies to knock them back when they're getting too close. His friends, however, he likes to keep nearby - leaping to their aid when things get dicey and taking a quick nap on their shoulder. His Lil Helpers are curious creatures, taking interest in everything the streets of New York have to offer, and cheering on his allies as they go. Ultimately when Naptime hits, no one will be able to keep their eyes open. - The best part of being asleep, is being asleep.”</p><p>Valve absolutely killed it with this guy. Something that many games get wrong, from the last two <em>Final Fantasy </em>games to the recent release <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/"><em><u>Highguard</u></em></a><em>, </em>is that you almost always need a playable character who is a weird little guy or a robot or something. <em>Deadlock</em> has several of these, including a reanimated Latina gargoyle named Ivy who wants to protect Spanish Harlem, but Rem really takes the cake conceptually and in execution. His combat barks are mainly nap-based, like a six-year-old who had played too much and tuckered himself out.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rem isn't the strongest in combat but Pillow Toss can be used to wipe out waves of troopers, and lowers the cooldown of other abilities when it hits.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rem’s primary weapon in combat is the little candle he holds, which zaps with a fairly decent range. Rem is one of a few characters small enough to fit into various crawl spaces in the map, allowing him to snag goodies in the tunnels. In combat, he serves a support role, with his pillow skill providing regular area damage that helps wipe out troopers in the lane. Rem’s ability Tag Along warps him to a nearby friendly character, healing both himself and the character he’s attached to while he takes a little nap. This serves as both healing and a movement ability, allowing Rem to escape or close distance to an ongoing fight. Rem can also use Tag Along to warp between characters, which refreshes the duration of the skill once per hero. His Lil Helpers, which look and act like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susuwatari?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Susuwatari</u></a> from <em>Spirited Away</em>, can be sent out to do chores like collect boxes and do Sinner’s Sacrifices, or to provide buffs to friendly units. Lastly, his Naptime ability puts enemies in an entire area to sleep, which is exceedingly powerful when a group of enemies are clustered together.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rem's Tag Along serves as means of closing distance, escaping a confrontation, and healing. The third tier of the ability grants a buff similar to </span><a href="https://deadlock.wiki/Boundless_Spirit?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Boundless Spirit</span></a><span> during and briefly after the nap.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I cannot stress how fun Rem is to play and build around. In the few rounds I have played with him, I’ve used builds that emphasize his pillow, making it hit like you have a brick in there. Later items like <a href="https://deadlock.wiki/Mystic_Reverb?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mystic Reverb</u></a> or <a href="https://deadlock.wiki/Surge_of_Power?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Surge of Power</u></a> can be used to power Rem's pillow up, providing a slowdown effect or a buff respectively every time he hits something with it. I’m sure that players will immediately find new and busted ways to break him.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rem's gaze causes enemies to sleep. When they wake up, they take spirit damage in the form of a headache.</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the bigger lesson, particularly in light of <em>Highguard’s </em>launch, might be on how to correctly cultivate a game. <em>Deadlock </em>is in a good and stable place now because it slowly gestated and iterated over years, listening to the needs of its community. This is a luxury of time and budget that many games simply don’t have. That difficult, conversational work is a key component to figuring out exactly what people want, it is not something you can always assume. And one thing that people clearly want is a sleepy little furry guy in his jammies who simply wants to go night night to dreamtime.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:cvyvx4fduvzacxbmxk4ggv6j/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdiwck42ys2c" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreic5yizfshspg5dcmj5gsat5gco47rzf4bxxovthzbjfiasdlioqf4"><p lang="en">a friend asked me to draw this

            <guid>1420228</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241">The second season of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> TV</a> show has prominently featured New Vegas, a location first seen in Obsidian’s spin-off open-world RPG <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> over 15 years ago. That’s led to a lot of <em>Fallout</em> fans and newcomers alike wanting to play or replay what many consider to be the best game in the franchise. But in 2026, you have a few different ways to play <em>New Vegas,</em> and not all of them are great. So here’s the best way to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, along with some other options that might also work depending on your situation.</p> <h2>The Best Way To Play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h2> <p>There is a simple answer to the best way to play <em>Fallout: New Vega</em>s, but the answer itself isn’t what I would call simple or easy. The best way to play this classic RPG is on PC and with a ton of mods. Thankfully, there’s a very handy guide out there that I used recently to turn <em>New Vegas’</em>s somewhat messy PC port into a fine-tuned experience: <a href="https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/index.html">The Viva New Vegas comprehensive mod guide</a>.</p>

 <p>Something I really love about the Viva New Vegas guide is that it doesn’t aim to change<em> New Vegas</em> into some super-realistic version of the game that barely looks or plays like the original. Instead, the guide walks you through everything you’ll need to do (and there are plenty of steps to follow…) to get New Vegas running soundly on a modern PC. So no more random crashes or bad performance issues. It’s wonderful. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1q8l6pb/viva_new_vegas_for_fallout_new_vegas_via/">This guide can also work for Steam Deck, too.</a></p> <figure id="attachment_2000664218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000664218"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000664218">©VNV / Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The other reason I love this guide is that it offers more mods and options for those who want more features in <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Want to add more NPCs? Or a sprint button? Or improved textures that match the vibes of the original game, but make things look a little sharper on a high-resolution monitor? The Viva New Vegas mod guide will offer you all of that and more. Best of all, the guide will help you pick and choose the bits you want and let you skip stuff that doesn’t sound like your jam.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’m not sure I can go back to playing <em>New Vegas</em> on any other platform or without many of the smart quality-of-life mods and tweaks this guide adds to Obsidian’s <em>Fallout</em> spin-off. But perhaps you don’t have the patience to spend around an hour or two modding <em>New Vegas</em> on your PC. Or maybe you don’t own a gaming PC. Well, this next section is for you!</p>

 <h2>How To Play <em>Fallout: New Vega</em>s On Xbox</h2> <p><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> was released on Xbox 360 and PS3 alongside PC back in 2010. Those versions of the game can be hard to go back to on original hardware. Trust me on that. But thankfully, Xbox owners don’t have to play <em>New Vegas</em> on Xbox 360. The open-world RPG is one of many Xbox 360 games that support FPS Boost on Series X/S. And it works like a treat. All you need to do is own<em> New Vegas o</em>n Xbox, install it, and turn on FPS Boost in the game’s Xbox compatibility settings. And that’s it. No guide needed.</p> <p>Now, when you boot up <em>New Vegas</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/-lW2NfxrRkI">you’ll get to play the classic RPG at 60 FPS</a>. And it’s a pretty stable, if not perfect, experience. It is a lot better than how the game ran on PS3 and 360 back in the day. Of course, this version of the game doesn’t include any extra mods or tweaks, and it runs at 720p, which isn’t ideal. But if you don’t mind the fuzzier visuals or perhaps prefer a more authentic presentation, <em>Fallout</em>: <em>New Vegas</em> on Series X/S is a damn fine way to play one of the best <em>Fallout</em> games ever made.</p>

 <h2>The Worst Ways To Play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></h2> <p>If you want to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> on a PlayStation 5, I have bad news: It ain’t great. The game, like all PS3 games, doesn’t support native playback on the PS5, so you have to stream it from the cloud. Bleh. It’s playable, assuming you have a good internet connection, but it lacks the 60 FPS boost of the Xbox port or any of the mod options of the PC version. Not helping matters is that the <a href="https://youtu.be/smc_UGrDe98">PS3 ports of Bethesda games back then were rough</a>, often featuring extra bugs and performance issues not present on Xbox 360. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-ps5-ps3-ps-plus-cloud-streaming-2000663815">Oh, and depending on when you read this, you might literally be unable to stream New Vegas on PS5 at al</a>l.</p> <p>If you really, really want to play <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, but don’t want to mod it, don’t own an Xbox, and hate the idea of playing the PS3 port of the game, then you could play it via Amazon’s Luna streaming service. I’ve tried this out, and it runs better than the PlayStation 3 version and supports mouse and keyboard. But without any mods, <em>New Vegas</em> can be a bit of a mess. Still, if your options are limited to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-play-free-amazon-prime-luna-cloud-1851403763">streaming <em>New Vegas </em>on Luna or PS5</a>, I’d go with Luna every day of the week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“I Can’t Fully Trust Anywhere Now”: GDC Reports 1-in-4 Devs Have Been Laid Off in Last 2 Years]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/</link>
            <guid>1420210</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> has <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially been published</a> by the <strong>Game Developers Conference (GDC)</strong>, which surveyed over <strong>2,300</strong> <strong>developers</strong> in an attempt to put a finger on the pulse of the game industry, asking developers about a range of topics, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/">Generative AI</a></strong>, the epidemic of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">mass industry layoffs</a></strong>, which kinds of <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">video games are dominating the industry</a>, and more.</p>



<p>When reading the report, it's always worth remembering that there are hundreds of thousands of developers not surveyed here, and that with GDC updating its survey process every year, it doesn't present a complete picture of where the industry is at. That said, just like how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">SteamDB</a></strong> numbers don't show the full picture of an individual game's success, that doesn't mean the information is useless.</p>



<p>Information like how, among developers surveyed by GDC, <strong>1-in-4 have been laid off in the last two years</strong>, and out of those laid off developers, <strong>nearly half of them are still struggling to find a job</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>According to our survey, 17% of game industry professionals reported being laid off in the past 12 months, while 11% said they were laid off during the 12 months prior (lining up with our 2025 survey data). Altogether, that means over one-fourth (28%) of respondents have experienced a layoff in the past two years, increasing to one-third (33%) for those in the United States</em>," the report reads. </p>



<p>"<em>Of those who’ve experienced a layoff, almost half (48%) said they haven’t found another job yet. This includes 36% of game industry professionals who were laid off 1 to 2 years ago."</em></p>



<p>Industry churn and layoffs are an unfortunate reality for any industry; game developers certainly aren't alone in experiencing turbulent times in their industry of choice. But layoffs are short-term, band-aid solutions that only make a positive impact on a company's bottom line, while making a negative impact everywhere else. </p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been laid off so many times in the last 5-6 years, had so many turbulent issues working in games. I have trauma and <strong>can’t ever fully trust anywhere now</strong></em>," said one of the developers surveyed. <strong>23%</strong> of those surveyed anticipate layoffs in the coming year, and another <strong>30%</strong> remain unsure. That's a majority of developers who can't say with certainty that they'll have job stability, even if they know they are good at what they do.</p>



<p>"<em>The market has been so challenging I’m not sure I’ll remain in games</em>," said another respondent. Meanwhile, the next class of developers currently in school looking to join the industry don't see much hope for their own prospects. <strong>3-in-4 game development students surveyed are concerned they won't be able to find a job</strong>, while <strong>87% of their teachers surveyed</strong> believe their students will struggle to find work.</p>



<p>When companies like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">Ubisoft</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/">Meta</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-layoffs-nearly-all-areas-western-offices/">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">Amazon,</a></strong> to name just a few, lay off their employees by the tens, hundreds, and thousands at a time, not only are those companies and their teams losing talented developers, but each layoff is one more traumatizing event that might make someone decide they won't come back to games. Young developers coming into the industry lose proper mentorship because there aren't any veterans around to mentor them, and the developers who survive each layoff are left with more work to be done in less time, leading to more crunch and developer burnout. None of those things contributes to an industry that can produce better and more entertaining games for players.  </p>



<p>As one particularly blunt student put it, "<em>There aren't any jobs. Everyone's getting fired. It's f***ed."</em></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/esports/games/call-of-duty/" id="3373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-02-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its season 2 content</a> for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" id="2795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>, including the launch of several new multiplayer maps and a handful of returning ones, with the season’s start on February 5.</p>



<p>Multiplayer content is a central focal point of the second season of Black Ops 7. In addition to several new modes arriving throughout the season, ranked play is returning, along with other multiplayer events. Nine multiplayer maps are included. Included among them are a couple of remastered maps and a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6.</p>







<h2>Remastered and Returning Maps Are Built for 6v6 Play</h2>



<p>Cliff Town is a remaster of the Yemen map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty/" id="32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty </a>team describes this as a tightly packed map with a good blend of narrow alleys and elevated Vantage points. It is a medium-sized map scheduled for release mid-season.</p>



<p>Additionally, Slums is another remastered medium-sized map from the second Black Ops game. This map will be available at launch. It’s dubbed one of the most iconic Maps in the Black Ops series, offering a true test of skill for both casual and competitive players.</p>



<p>There are also a couple of returning maps from Black Ops 6, including Firing Range and Grind. Both are medium-sized and scheduled for mid-season release.</p>







<h2 id="h-five-new-maps-are-on-the-way-to-black-ops-7">Five New Maps Are on the Way to Black Ops 7</h2>



<p>In addition to the returning maps, there’s a handful of new maps on the way. Some of which will even be available at the launch of the second season.</p>



<p>Torment, Sake, and Nexus will be available on launch. Torment and Sake are exclusively built for 6v6 gameplay. Nexus, however, is also compatible with 2v2 matches as it is a small-sized map.</p>



<p>There’s also a new map called Torque. It is a small map built for 6v6 gameplay and recalls the Battle of Los Angeles from Black Ops 2.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s a brand-new skirmish map built for 20v20 gameplay. Named “Peak,” the map is built for large-scale confrontations. It features narrow medieval streets, High Value Sectors to claim, sniper rooftops, a central snaking road, a waterlogged perimeter with Tactical Rafts, a harbor, fishery warehouses, and intense house-to-house combat.</p>

<figure data-uuid="511aeb2defe5f"><a title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/511aeb2defe5f/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After a particularly packed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Nintendo Direct</a>, we've got our first glimpse at the official Switch box art for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> (yes, it's very cute) and the all-important price.</p>
<p>Let's kick things off with the price tag, eh? The game is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/fr-fr/Jeux/Jeux-a-telecharger-sur-Nintendo-Switch/Tomodachi-Life-Une-vie-de-reve-2786386.html">European</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-switch/?utm_source=SW-AA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1151-01&amp;utm_id=N1151-01">North American eShops</a> for <strong>£49.99 / 59,99€ / $59.99</strong>, which is roughly what we'd expect for a first-party Switch 1 release. As a reminder, the game launches on <strong>16th April</strong>, so you still have a little while to get your orders in.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067npmigo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Much like the 3DS original (for which we did a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-tomodachi-life">Box Art Brawl comparison</a> a few weeks back), Living the Dream's cover puts a whole lotta focus on the Miis, showing them getting up to all sorts of mischief. We've got a family enjoying a picnic, an art class, a gossiping alien, heck, there's even one Mii being plucked to the skies by a giant hand.</p>
<p>All of this sits in front of the island backdrop, complete with its shops, houses and attractions. As revealed in the Direct, all of these Miis and the island itself are yours to customise as you please, so your game environment might end up looking rather different to the one that Nintendo's showcasing on the box.</p>
<p>Enough chatter, here it is in all of its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f9ca487069b55"><a title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f9ca487069b55/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's pretty, right? The Direct filled us in on all kinds of information about Living the Dream, running us through character and island customisation, romance options, a huge variety of shops and much more. You'll find the full rundown of every announcement in the article below.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201</link>
            <guid>1420165</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em> players</a> were aghast that the raid hero shooter launched without an FOV slider on console. Well, now it has one, and some other small fixes to help with its launch week woes.</p> <p>“We’ve just pushed out a patch with a number of improvements, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle options for ADS and Crouch, many video settings, and more,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2016938033938108505">1.0.4 update</a> from Wildlight Entertainment. “The team is also working on optimization improvements, they just need a few more days to cook.”</p> <p>Players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S can now adjust the field-of-view to 110, while a number of new visual settings help PC players limit rendering load to improve framerate. You can’t yet disable motion blur and depth of field but that’s coming down the road. A gnarly bug on PS5 that was crashing the game after leaving matches has also been addressed.</p>

 <p>The first round of many promised improvements comes as <em>Highguard</em> struggles to hang on to its slice of multiplayer mindshare after coming to PC and console earlier this week. An avalanche of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">collapse of the concurrent player numbers on PC</a> aren’t promising, but I’ve also heard anecdotally from friends on console that they’ve been enjoying it more as they continue playing and come to understand the nuances of the genre mashup.</p> <p>Here are the full <em>Highguard</em> 1.0.4 Patch Notes:</p> <blockquote>  <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0">Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English.
