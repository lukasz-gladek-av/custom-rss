            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-noteworthy-character-in-gta-6<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A who's who of Vice City.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar may have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">delayed Grand Theft Auto 6 to May 26, 2026</a>, but the studio has surprised everybody with a new trailer loaded with story and character details. While we knew from the first trailer that GTA 6 would feature two protagonists, it mostly set the stage for a return to Vice City. But with the newest trailer, Vice City gets a little more full thanks to a bevy of new faces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While their full roles and personalities might still be a mystery, the new trailer and the updated official GTA 6 website shares just enough that we now have a rough outline of who some of these friendly faces are. So read on for every GTA 6 character we’ve seen so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Every Important GTA 6 Character We’ve Seen So Far</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Jason Duval</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/jason-duval-04-1746540363699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jason Duval. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first protagonist in our Bonnie and Clyde duo is Jason Duval, a man who’s looking for the easy life but can’t seem to catch a break. After serving time in the Army, he’s in the Leonida Keys working odd jobs for the local drug runners. The only thing keeping him going is his love for Lucia.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lucia Caminos</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/lucia-caminos-06-1746540461266.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lucia Caminos. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of the trailer, we meet Lucia just as she’s released from Leonida Penitentiary, having served time after fighting for her family. We know her father taught Lucia how to fight from a young age and that their family moved to Leonida from Liberty City (GTA’s version of New York City). With Jason by her side, it seems Lucia has a plan to give both of them a new start towards a better life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like past GTA games, GTA 6 is led by a couple of streetwise toughs hoping to find the score of a lifetime. What’s unique is that unlike the trio from GTA 5, and the lone wolves of older GTA games, Jason and Lucia seem to genuinely love each other, and that might allow them to reach new heights – or fall even harder than past main characters.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Brian Heder</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/brian-heder-03-1746540941114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Brian Heder. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Brian is Jason’s landlord and one of the aforementioned local drug runners in Leonida. By day he runs and operates Brian’s Boat Works and Marina, but this serves as a legitimate front for his drug business for which he hires Jason to act as some additional muscle. He sounds suspiciously like the actor Stephen Root, but Rockstar isn’t sharing its voice cast for GTA 6 just yet (we asked).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Cal Hampton</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cal-hampton-03-1746540562480.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cal Hampton. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jason’s friend and drinking buddy at The Rusty Anchor, Cal is described as having “casual paranoia” and seems somewhat prone to conspiracy theories… but also having a good time, so maybe it all balances out for him? If Rockstar’s penchant for American satire continues, we can expect Cal to exhibit some of the worst, if funniest, parts of Leonidian society.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boobie Ike</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/boobie-ike-01-1746540641301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Boobie Ike. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A local Vice City legend, Boobie Ike is now a legitimate entrepreneur and business mogul, a far cry from his life on the streets. Boobie runs everything from real estate, a strip club, and even a recording studio which he is using as a launch pad for a new music empire with his associate, Dre’Quan. Keep an eye out for Only Raw Records’ first hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Dre’Quan Priest</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/drequan-priest-02-1746540704532.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dre'Quan Priest. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Boobie, Dre’Quan is a businessman whose primary job is gangster and drug dealer. He’s hoping to use his partnership with Boobie Ike and the talents of his first music signing, Real Dimez, to promote himself to the Vice City elites. It remains to be seen how much of Dre’Quan’s ambitions will end up helping or hurting him in his climb up the power ladder.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Real Dimez</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/real-dimez-04-1746540816790.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Real Dimez. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Musical duo Real Dimez comprises Bae-Luxe and Roxy, high school friends who turned their street toughness into a hip-hop and social media career. They’ve signed on with Dre’Quan Priest and Boobie Ike to capitalize on the success of their first hit, DWNPLY, to become Only Raw Records’ breakout stars.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raul Bautista</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/raul-bautista-04-1746540887820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Raul Bautista. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be Grand Theft Auto without a few criminal masterminds, and Vice City’s got theirs with Raul Bautista. A veteran bank robber, his tendency to up the stakes during a heist means that his crew often has to deal with more than they planned for. Maybe one of his best-laid plans will be something Jason and Lucia sign on for to get their big break?</p><h3 data-cy="title3">And More (Various Gangsters, Cop in Body Armor, Influencers)</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/ambrosia-03-1746541721202.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leonida Man and Woman. Credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of faces that get a brief appearance in the trailer who aren't named. From various gangsters who Lucia and Jason seem to have run-ins with, to, of course, cops looking to bring down Vice City's criminals. And in between are all manner of partying influences, gun store owners, and other Leonida denizens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the main characters we know about so far in GTA 6. Has anyone caught your eye yet? How do you think the two protagonists will stack up to past GTA anti-heroes?

            <p>
EA has confirmed its next Battlefield game is still on track to launch before next April, with a full reveal due this "summer", following several months of invite-only playtests.
</p>
<p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson shared the news of Battlefield's imminent reveal as part of the company's <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">Q4 and financial year 2025 earnings report</a>. "As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline," he wrote, "beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment."
</p>
<p>
The publisher also recommitted to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">previously announced FY26 release window </a>for Battlefield, meaning the game is still on track to launch before April next year. Back in February, Wilson suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA might be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us" - seemingly an oblique reference to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">since been delayed into May next year</a>.

<p>
EA has previously shared some lofty goals for its next Battlefield, saying it wants it to be the "biggest [series  entry] we've ever made." To that end, it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">running invite-only playtests</a> since March as it seeks to "get the community back on [its] side" following the poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> - which quickly became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">one of Steam's worst-reviewed games of all time</a> after its launch in 2021, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">later acknowledged to have flopped</a>.
</p>
<p>
While EA's recent Battlefield playtests have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">resulted in a flurry of leaked footage</a>, little has been officially revealed beyond the fact it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in Battlefield 2042. There've also been suggestions, based on landmarks sighted in the single bit of concept art shared last year, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">the series might be heading to Gibraltar</a>. But with a full reveal due this "summer" - perhaps at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-dates-confirmed">this year's Summer Game Fest</a> - there shouldn't be too long until we learn more.
</p>
<p>
Before then, however, EA <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1919754055284314568">has announced plans</a> to "continue scaling Battlefield Labs testing globally", saying it'll begin inviting more players across Europe, North America, and select areas of Asia throughout May. These playtest will include new content, as well as further testing of weapon balancing, damage values, plus "movement and combat pacing mechanics".
</p>
<p>
Away from Battlefield, EA has confirmed its free-to-play Skate reboot is similarly due to launch before April 2026. Previously, developer Full Circle said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">remains committed to its 2025 early access release window</a>, although a more specific date is yet to be shared.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Split Fiction has had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" according to <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">EA</a>, as the latest co-op adventure from Hazelight Studios nears&nbsp;<strong>4 million copies sold</strong>. The game was highlighted by EA in its wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year, and counted as a key part of what led to a "<em>strong finish</em>" for the year alongside EA Sports FC 25.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios followed up the news from the financial report with a post on its official <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">X</a> account, saying "<em>4 million sold! So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it's amazing...Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight. And so many hot dogs made...</em>"</p>
<p>Hazelight's previous title and game of the year winner in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/">It Takes Two,</a> surpassed <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/it-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer/">20 million copies sold in March 2025</a>. Split Fiction has a long way to go to reach that milestone, but it certainly seems like it's on its way there.</p>
<p>Just last week, we learned that the previously announced Split Fiction movie will star Sydney Sweeney as one of the two female leads. It's not yet known which of the two she will play or who will join her as a co-star. Wicked director Jon M. Chu has signed on to direct the adaptation, with Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese penning the script.</p>
<p>Along with confirming the sales milestone for Split Fiction, EA's wrap-up report for its 2025 fiscal year confirmed that the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">Battlefield</a> game will be revealed this summer and that it will release sometime before April 2026. The next Skate game is also set to release during that same period.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/be-careful-what-you-read-about-an-elden-ring-movie.1182735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662200/elden-ring-movie-nexus-point-news-be-careful<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Tuesday, a publication called <em>Nexus Point News</em> published a headline for what looked to be a major piece of entertainment news: “EXCLUSIVE: Alex Garland Set To Direct ‘Elden Ring’ Film For A24.” The article claimed that <em>Elden Ring</em> “is expected to be Garland’s next film” and that shooting is expected to start in 2026.</p><p>But don’t get your hopes up: soon after the article was published, <em>Nexus Point News</em> pulled it, and the publication won’t say why. How this article made the rounds is an interesting case study in the way news travels on the internet.</p><p>We first saw the <em>Nexus Point News</em> article from a Wario64 post on X. Generally, Wario64 is a great account to follow to see breaking news in video games almost as soon as it happens. And the account is quite popular, with more than 1 million followers on X. But none of us at <em>The Verge</em> had ever heard of <em>Nexus Point News</em>, let alone recognized it as a place that reliably breaks entertainment news, so something didn’t seem right.</p><p>(Another recent <em>Nexus Point News</em> “exclusive” includes a potential cast member “being eyed” <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-dacre-montgomery-is-being-eyed-to-join-star-wars-starfighter">for one of the male leads</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651695/star-wars-starfighter-date-ryan-gosling"><em>Star Wars: Starfighter</em></a>, but the article includes an update that says “a LucasFilm spokesperson has denied this reporting.”)</p><p>So I messaged Wario64, asking why he reposted it. He said that the person who posted a thread on the gaming forum ResetEra claimed the site was reliable and that “I guess I’m sharing cause I too think it’s absurd lol.”</p><p>That thread appears to be <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/">this one</a>, where the poster says, in a reply to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139592964">somebody asking</a> “bro what the fuck is this source lmaooo,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/#post-139593192">that</a> “Nexus point news is pretty reliable, they are breaking more and more news before the traditional trades.”</p><p>Soon after, I refreshed the <em>Nexus Point News</em> story and saw that it had been taken down. I told Wario64 that we were looking into the story on our end and about its removal. Soon after, Wario64 posted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1919831651968024694">about the removal</a> and deleted the original tweet.</p><p>Then, I emailed <em>Nexus Point News’</em> press line to see if somebody could say what was going on. Demet Koc, the publication’s editor-in-chief, replied two minutes later but declined to comment.</p><p>A24’s Sophia Shin also declined to comment on the record.</p><p>The possibility of an <em>Elden Ring </em>adaptation seems likely. FromSoftware said in early 2022 that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22981060/fromsoftware-elden-ring-franchise-intellectual-properties-future-expansion">hoped to</a> expand the franchise “beyond the realm of games.” George R.R. Martin, who provided <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin">the “mythos”</a> for the world of <em>Elden Ring</em>, hinted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189979/george-r-r-martin-on-a-potential-elden-ring-adaptation">last year</a> that some kind of adaptation might be in the works. And FromSoftware is about to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, a multiplayer-focused spinoff, so announcing a film around now would make some sense. But for the moment, there’s nothing official about an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie.</p><p>A ResetEra admin locked the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182474/page-2#post-139593882">thread</a> about the article and another one. “For a site no one’s heard of, they sure have a lot of exclusives,” <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-point-news-alex-garland-set-to-direct-%E2%80%98elden-ring%E2%80%99-film-for-a24.1182531/#post-139593768">the admin said</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> would be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, which is wonderful for that plumber guy, but mostly meant piss all for us PC people. The thing is, this version of the game actually comes with some new stuff, and I like new stuff, and publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco</a> only vaguely said all the new bits would be coming to "other platforms". But! I bring good news, as yes, the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition extras are coming to PC as part of a Tarnished Pack DLC.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This comes from the first FromSoftware Games Event Spring 2025, held earlier today, which <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a> covered and <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others">RPG Site</a> kindly extrapolated details from. Now, to be clear, there aren't many details, but something is better than nothing. For one, there'll be a total of four new armour sets to acquire. On top of that there's two new starting classes, Knight of Ides, and Heavy Armored Knight, both of which are, you guessed it, knights! Not particularly exciting given that there's already some knight options, but what can you do? These two knights make up two of the four new armour sets.
</p>
<p>
You'll also have a total of three new looks for your trusty steed Torrent, which I suppose is more than the none you could choose from before. Apparently some more weapons and skills are being added into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> too. At the very least, FromSoftware did say that the DLC pack will be cheap for those not on Switch 2, though I am a bit surprised this isn't just coming in the form of a free update.
</p>
<p>
Now all we need to do is cross our fingers that that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">Not Bloodborne 2 But It's Basically Bloodborne 2 Except It's An Online Game game The Duskbloods</a> comes to PC eventually too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re even the slightest bit online, you’ve probably already heard, but something unthinkably, pivotally important happened in the world of <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> today: Tom Walker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn04UwfKk9o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted the ending</a> of his maximum-traffic-speed playthrough of <em>GTA IV</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The greatest romance that ever has or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/im-already-totally-enamored-with-grand-theft-auto-6s-jason-and-lucia-and-ive-had-them-for-less-than-5-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ever will be depicted</a> in Rockstar’s satirical setting, Walker’s playthrough orbited around cars’ almost gravitational attraction to main character Niko Bellic. Also, said cars, due to a cheeky little settings modification, moved at a million miles per hour. The central challenge made itself clear within several seconds of the beginning of any stream or video: avoid the titular autos at all costs.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I finished GTA 4 with all the cars at 9999x speed." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn04UwfKk9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>"I get the idea in my head that I will defeat stupid challenges that don't matter pretty often,” Walker <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-fast-traffic-stream-twitch-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Aftermath last year</a>. “To me one of the most human things you can do is commit yourself to a challenge that doesn't matter, that only you care about and that you could stop doing at any time. If life is suffering, why not choose more suffering – and more life?"</p><p>Walker kept at it for the better part of a year, actually completing his run in late 2024, but only just now uploading the final fruits of his labor to YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65s6_9-Gh30&amp;list=PLI_N-KSDRamydGIKwJDLcLcC_VRH0g0-I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The complete saga is a ride</a>, and I can’t recommend it enough. You’d think that after witnessing a two-ton death trap emerge seemingly from nowhere to splatter a hapless career criminal over a thousand times, it’d stop being funny. And yet!</p><p>Toward the end of his run, Walker battled not just every single car in Liberty City, but also conflicting emotions. Getting one ending didn’t feel as revelatory as he’d hoped, so he went back and got the game’s other, darker ending in which Niko’s cousin, Roman, dies. What ensued was peak cinema, with Walker hunting down the game’s final foe as his health meter flashed red, fully aware that a single stray bullet would force him to restart an arduous multi-part mission he’d already attempted several times.

			<p>EA announced in its latest <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">financial report</a> for Q4 of its 2025 fiscal year that the next Battlefield game will be fully revealed sometime this summer and will launch before the end of its 2026 fiscal year, ending April 2026. It also confirmed that the highly anticipated return of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-skate-game-wont-be-playable-offline-to-support-its-multiplayer-skateboarding-sandbox/">Skate</a> will arrive sometime in this fiscal year ending April 2026.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Wilson highlighted the release and reveal of Battlefield, calling it "<em>a pivotal step</em>" as the company moves forward in this fiscal year.</p>
<p>"<em>As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to execute across a deep pipeline</em>," Wilson said. "<em>Beginning this summer with the highly anticipated reveal of Battlefield, a pivotal step in delivering on our next generation of blockbuster entertainment</em>."</p>
<p>Later in the report, EA states that it expects its revenue for its 2026 fiscal year to be driven by "<em>the EA Sports portfolio, The Sims, and the launches of Battlefield and Skate.</em>" Previously, EA announced that the new Skate game will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-launches-in-early-access-next-year/">released in early access sometime this year</a>. We've yet to see an official release date.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-will-add-more-players-to-battlefield-labs-playtesting-this-month-across-europe-north-america-and-asia/">EA provided a development update</a> for the new Battlefield game and its Battlefield Labs playtesting, where it confirmed that players in Asia will begin to be invited, and that the playtest will grow in scale over May to invite more players to participate and introduce new content.</p>

In addition to the upcoming showcase, he confirmed the game will be out within the current fiscal year, a window that’s become much more open since <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> was pushed back to May of 2026. </p><p>Wilson previously suggested that Rockstar Games’ juggernaut was a factor in its launch window calculus. “We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn’t going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this <em>Battlefield</em> to be all that it needed to be,” he said earlier this year. </p><p>Is it possible we now see the game arrive earlier than expected and go head-to-head with the next <em>Call of Duty </em>this fall? And will we see the next <em>Battlefield</em> stick to the current $70 price point or hop on the Microsoft bandwagon and target $80 along with certain other releases this holiday season? Those will be some of the questions facing EA as it tries to restore <em>Battlefield</em> to its former glory after a series of missteps in recent entries. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-leaks-gameplay-bf4-bf3-fps-ea-labs-drag-1851769188">So far the buzz is positive</a></span>. Player tests and ongoing leaks around the next <em>Battlefield</em> have been getting some long-time fans excited that the franchise might be finding its footing again while also returning to its roots. It would be nice to have <em>Battlefield </em>back in the multiplayer mix, even if the live service market is getting more competitive than ever. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the board game All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing, an immensely wealthy wrestling fan from the future uses the power of time travel to bring together some of the most iconic wrestlers from the past, present, and future to compete against one another. The game, designed by Mohamed Al Qadi and Jad Yammine and published by Cation Arts, offers players a fun time, whether or not you're familiar with pro wrestling and its pantheon of characters.</p><div catalogid="d55f387f-9d55-466a-a73e-98f67d3532b9" id="218897"><div id="218897" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Time Wrestling: All or Nothing Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who grew up in the ‘90s like I did knows the WWF (as it was called back then, before the World Wildlife Fund won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE#Lawsuit_and_renaming_(2002)" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademark dispute</a>) was all the rage among kids. So, while I opted to get my spandex fix with Power Rangers, I still had enough folks in my circle to know who the Macho Man and the British Bulldog were. While ATW’s subject matter may not be a big selling point for me, its balancing act of managing your resources and knowing when to push your luck kept me coming back round after round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In ATW, much like in actual wrestling, players attempt to exhaust and weaken each other, with the end goal being to pin their opponent and take home the win. Each selectable wrestler – including legends like Macho Man Randy Savage and the British Bulldog, alongside ATW original characters – features unique abilities and varying levels of health and stamina, which adds some lovely variety to the game and helps keep matches exciting from one to the next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat plays out with the player holding “initiative” playing cards from their hand and rolling dice to deal damage. Successful hits push the Momentum Track in that player’s favor, replicating the crowd hyping up the wrestler. The higher the momentum, the easier it becomes to land hits and gain other bonuses, which incentivizes continued aggression. Initiative only switches when an attack misses, the defender blocks, the defender uses their once-per-game “Reversal” ability (which instantly stops the combat), or the attacker voluntarily passes to regain some stamina and cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the different attack bonuses and the ability to combo cards together, there is a pleasant amount of depth and strategy in ATW without being overly complex. What I found most interesting, though, is how <em>initiative</em> is handled – it's done in a way I haven’t encountered in other games before. I really enjoyed this “press your luck” approach, and it made managing my hand of cards, stamina, and momentum more exciting. It often left me with a tough choice: do I push hard and risk leaving myself in rough shape for a chance to cinch a pin, or do I pass and forfeit the attack to try and weather the next assault, hoping I’ll be in a better position to strike back?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of cards, this is perhaps where my biggest issue with ATW lies. Instead of relying on text, the game heavily uses symbols and icons to denote things like damage, stamina requirements, special attributes, and other modifiers. As a general rule of thumb, if a game <em>can</em> employ icons, it should – so long as they are both readable and not overwhelming. Luckily, I never found there to be too many icons to decode in ATW, but the readability leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action cards, which you use the most, feature colorful artwork of various wrestlers performing everything from jabs and punches to German suplexes and signature moves. However, this can make picking up on all the symbols more of a hassle than it should be – especially if you're on the receiving end and viewing them upside down or from a distance. More than a few times I encountered situations where finishers or dice modifiers were missed, or cards were mistaken for others, due to duplicate artwork being used for attacks with different stats. Perhaps it’s because of my long history with games like Magic: The Gathering, but I wish the information was presented atop a slightly opaque background, rather than directly over the art. It’s not a finisher on the game, but it’s certainly a bit of a jab to the chin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game box offers players plenty of value and flexibility, providing not only standard 1v1 matches but also a tag-team-based 2v2 mode, a cage match variant with new rules, and a solo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> mode that lets you improve your wrestler as you progress. The automated systems in solo mode are fine, but admittedly, as someone who has never quite gotten into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board games</a>, I spent far more time playing against others than diving into ATW’s campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for tag mode, the inclusion of specialty partner abilities and the ability to tag in my friend to continue combos added an extra layer of choice and strategy. Still, it didn’t quite hit as hard as the core 1v1 mode. Even with the new tag mechanic, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this mode simply adds more players at the expense of having more downtime, since only one attacker and one defender are active at any given time, with partners outside the ring. It’s still fun and led to some awesome team-up moments with friends, but I personally prefer the more intense, head-to-head two-player experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wanting to dive even deeper into the All Time Wrestling universe, the creators continue to release new expansions – fully compatible with existing content – that add legends like Sgt. Slaughter and the Junkyard Dog, alongside new game modes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four-player</a> free-for-alls and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-three-player-board-games">three-player</a>-specific Triple Threat matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you. With games clocking in at under 30 minutes for two players and around 45 minutes for tag teams, it's a great filler during game nights or something compact enough to take to a bar. I’d love to see this system adapted for other themes – like a shonen anime (think Dragon Ball Z) or something Power Rangers-inspired. There’s a surprising amount of depth here, while still being approachable for players of varying board game experience – even those coming to it purely for a love of wrestling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With All Time Wrestling, Cation Arts delivers a dramatic and faithful representation of the wild history of wrestling in a package that will delight fans of head-to-head games, regardless of whether you know what a DDT stands for or not.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2mge?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1e3g?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Cation Arts</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJpeE?object_uuid=1d3f2b21-42ca-46ea-a29d-eca2d1e54d62&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at The Wrestling Collection</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 7:15 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">All Time Wrestling is one of those games worth checking out even if the wrestling theme doesn’t grab you.

            <p>
Starbreeze Studios has acquired the publishing rights to its beleaguered heist sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a>, insisting the move will enable it to "accelerate content development and pursue broader business opportunities" for the franchise "as a whole".
</p>
<p>
Payday 3 got off to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">disastrous start</a> when it launched in September 2023, struggling with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-players-endure-second-consecutive-day-of-server-issues-preventing-them-from-playing">serious matchmaking issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-requires-an-always-on-online-connection">unpopular online-only requirements</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-much-delayed-first-patch-is-finally-here">repeatedly delayed first major patch</a>. Its player count quickly plummeted and has been consistently dwarfed by its predecessor since then, with Starbreeze last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-seeks-long-term-success-after-disappointing-launch">admitting</a> numbers were "at significantly lower levels than [it] would like". Just a month later, CEO Tobias Sjögren was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">ousted by the board</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">new Payday 3 creative leadership team was brought in last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's in that context Starbreeze has now "reached a mutual agreement" with former Payday 3 publisher Plaion that'll enable the studio to fully acquire the publishing rights to the game. To finance the transaction, Starbreeze has <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-enters-into-agreement-regarding-the-publishing-rights-for-payday-3-and-carries-out-a-directed-share-issue-of-class-b-shares-amounting-to-sek-33-million/">announced it's issuing new shares worth SEK 33m</a>, with SEK 29m of the proceeds (approximately £2.3m) going toward repaying Plaion under the previous Payday 3 agreement, and "settling certain outstanding claims".
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, board member Thomas Lindgren said Starbreeze's Payday 3 acquisition would enable it to "significantly accelerate [its] content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the Payday franchise as a whole."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Starbreeze - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">currently also working on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> - has suggested more Payday could be on the way, despite the latest instalment's struggles. "While this agreement marks the conclusion of the current publishing arrangement," the studio wrote in its announcement, "it also lays the groundwork for a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion on future Payday franchise projects."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-review">awarded Payday 3 three out of five stars in 2023</a>, calling it a "shallow shooter that doesn't offer anywhere near enough bang for your ill-gotten buck."

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Minecraft’s</em> official support for virtual reality and mixed reality devices is over. Mojang announced last year that Minecraft would stop supporting VR headsets after March 2025, and per today’s <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em> 1.21.80 Update <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-bedrock-edition-1-21-80">patch notes</a>, that support has been removed, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2773555/minecraft-officially-kills-support-for-vr.html">as reported by <em>PCWorld</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>When Mojang announced the end of support for VR <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278397/minecraft-virtual-reality-support-end-2025">in October</a>, it said that you’ll still get updates on your PC, you’ll still be able to play without a VR / MR device, and that you’ll be able to continue building worlds or use any Marketplace purchases. At the time, Mojang’s reasoning for removing support <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">was that</a> “our ability to support VR / MR devices has come to an end.”</p><p>However, there are still ways to play <em>Minecraft</em> on a VR headset, if you’d like. If you have the Java version of the game for PC, you can use a mod like <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a>, which works on many VR platforms, or <a href="https://questcraft.org/">QuestCraft</a>, a port specific to Meta Quest headsets.</p><p>Still, I’m a little sad to see official VR support ending for <em>Minecraft</em>, especially if you, like me, can remember the incredibly impressive <em>Minecraft</em> demo for HoloLens from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7868363/minecraft-hololens-microsoft-freecell">way back in the day</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Alright, look, I get it. There's a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming sims</a> already. There's even the odd anime inspired farming sim here and there. But <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-seikyu">Tales of Seikyu</a>, which fits into that second camp, is different, I promise, because it has dating - and I think you can date an anthropomorphic otter man. I'm not talking queer slang here to be clear, though the character does kind of fit that meaning too. I'm talking about a man that looks like an otter, who walks around on two legs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I'm not entirely sure if he is romanceable or not, because a press release notes there's only six romanceable characters. He does appear on the splash screen for dateable characters during the game's early access release date trailer (we'll get to that in a minute), though more than six characters can be seen there. I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope that you can when the game launches into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/">early access on Steam</a> this May 21st (see, I told you we'd get there).

<p>
The game has got a bit more going for it than the usual farming sim stuff too. Yes, you can grow your own veggies and such, the difference is that you use the powers of a yokai to do it. Sometimes you might turn into a water sucking slime, other times a speedy flying crow person. It's pretty cute!
</p>
<p>
There's some action elements too, you can go off on little adventures and discover Seikyu's "secrets." I'm not going to say that the game looks mind blowing, there really are just so many farming games these days, but there's enough going for me vibes wise to say I'm prospectively into it. Dating the otter man will cinch the deal though, ACE Entertainment, so consider that if you want my money.

<p dir="ltr">"Now that's more like it," Dailly said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj4u37kk22r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his post</a>. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better… Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it.

Marathon might be the Bungie game getting all the attention <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">following last month's big reveal</a>, but the studio's keen to remind everyone <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> is still a thing - and a thing it's planning to support for a good long while. To that end, it's now revealed Destiny 2's next major multi-year story arc, which'll include a paid Star Wars expansion before the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Bungie first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">teased a major shake-up of Destiny 2's release model last September</a>, saying it would be ditching its traditional large-scale annual expansions and instead releasing two "medium-sized" paid expansions a year. And now, thanks to its latest developer stream, we've got a much clearer idea of what that'll look like when the plan takes effect this July.
</p>
<p>
With Destiny 2's decade-spanning Light and Dark Saga now officially concluded, Bungie has unveiled its next major story arc, the Fate Saga. It begins on 15th July with the Year of Prophecy and the launch of a new paid expansion, The Edge of Fate. "[This] is the start of a long journey," the studio <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">writes in its announcement post</a>, "and we are taking our time to tell a new story that for now will leave you with many unanswered questions. Each expansion will help answer some, so having two a year will allow us to deliver those beats at a faster pace than before."

<p>
Starting with The Edge of Fate, it takes players to a new destination known as Kepler, said to be inspired by "the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2's dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." There's talk of a new raid, plus new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific" abilities. The latter includes the Matterspark ability, enabling Guardians to change forms to navigate the terrain - with one of those forms looking a lot like Metroid's Morph Ball.
</p>
<p>
The Edge of Fate also marks the start of new season, Reclamation, and is accompanied by a free "core game update" for all players. This introduces the likes of new events and challenges, alongside a range of new features. There's a new activity selection screen known as The Portal, for instance, which is intended to provide easier access to Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and Solo Ops activities. It arrives alongside Destiny 2's Armour 3.0 rework and a new tier system, with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-7On9pcEoY">permanent shooting range</a> - enabling raid groups to test out their tactics on different enemies and bosses - coming later down the line.

<p>
More free content arrives on 9th September under the banner Ash &amp; Iron (Bungie hasn't said much about this yet beyond the fact it's a "major update" with an associated Rewards Pass) and that's followed by the weirdest part of today's announcement, Renegades, on 2nd December. It's unclear how this Star Wars themed second paid expansion is supposed to fit into Bungie's new story arc, but the studio says it'll be "integral" to the Fate Saga as it merges "Destiny's distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise". It includes a new dungeon, plus "new Destiny characters, innovative activities, and evolved mechanics designed to surprise and delight players."
</p>
<p>
Finally, Destiny 2's Year of Prophecy gets its fourth and final release - another free "major update" titled Shadow &amp; Order - on 3rd March next year. And if either of this year's paid expansions appeal, Bungie has opened pre-orders - for each individual expansion as well as a number of Year of Prophecy bundles - on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC. More details can be found in its <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">announcement post</a>.

Oh, and we can't forget about the tease of Darkwing Duck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of exciting info was unveiled for Disney Lorcana, and we're here to break it down to ensure you don't miss a thing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fabled Will Add Iconic and Epic Cards, A Goofy Movie, and Rotating Cards for Competitive Play</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-fabled-a-goofy-movie-image-1746510989873.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While we still have more to learn about Fabled, the teases given by the Disney Lorcana team are making the wait until pre-release on August 29 and wide release on September 5 just that much harder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Goofy Movie cards will be one of the biggest additions to Disney Lorcana with Fabled, but the team wasn't ready to share exactly which cards will become available. They did share, however, that Mickey and Minnie will be the very first Iconic Cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Iconic Cards will be the rarest cards in all of Lorcana, as only two will appear in each set going forward, and beautiful cards of Mickey and Minnie on a carousel will serve as the Iconic Cards all players will be chasing for their sets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Iconic Cards will be Epic Cards, which are rarer than Legendary but not as hard to get as Enchanted and Iconic. These cards will also feature special artwork and foil treatments and will give players even more chances to score a special card like a new Elsa (Snow Queen) one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big change in Fabled is that it will mark the first time Lorcana will be rotating out certain cards and making them illegal for competitive play. Top-level competitive play is called Core Constructed and will not allow players to use any cards from the first four sets of Lorcana. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Fabled Cards and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of older cards shouldn't worry too much though, as there will be plenty of ways to play your older cards, including in a new format called Infinity Constructed. Furthermore, Fabled will introduce reprinted cards from earlier sets - like Winnie the Pooh (Hunny Wizard) - and those will be fully usable in competitive play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“To keep the competitive game thriving, rotating out older cards to encourage new strategies and fresh deck designs is a really important part of the next chapter,” said Ryan Miller, Brand Manager and Co Designer of <em>Disney Lorcana</em> <em>TCG</em> at Ravensburger. “But because we know there are cards in those early sets that are important to a lot of fans’ deck-building strategies, and we know not everybody got the cards they wanted the first year, we’re re-printing some cards from those first sets in <em>Fabled</em>. Including Enchanted versions of some fan favorites!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are new to Lorcana and all of these new sets sound enticing and wonderful, the team has announced a new way to jump into this trading card game with the Collection Starter Set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set includes four Fabled booster packs, a Tinker Bell (Giant Fairy) "Glimmer Foil" Promo Card, one card portfolio with Mickey Mouse (Brave Little Tailor) on the front, and one collector's guide.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/collection-starter-set-1746511057724.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Reign of Jafar Offers Aladdin and Bambi Cards Alongside a New Co-Op Adventure</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we previously mentioned, Reign of Jafar is Lorcana's eighth set and it will be available in pre-release on May 30 and wide release on June 6. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reign of Jafar will continue the ongoing story in Lorcana that stars the Disney villain, and the Lorcana team has given a summary of what fans can expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Jafar now possesses the Hexwell Crown and, with it, he has corrupted Archazia’s Island to his wicked will," the official description reads. "Traps and illusions abound in <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, and glimmers like Jasmine – Steady Strategist and Rapunzel – High Climber will need to band together to steal back the crown and defeat the evil vizier."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Cards and Sets</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Reign of Jafar, fans will be able to jump into Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist, which is a new "co-op experience-in-a-box" that will allow four players to team up and take on Jafar and his minion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the cards, fans will be able to try to get Bambi (Prince of the Forest), Flower (Shy Skunk), Thumper (Young Bunny), Jafar (High Sultan of Lorcana), Magic Carpet (Phantom Rug), Aladdin (Vigilant Guard), and much more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teases of the Future Include Whispers in the Well and Darkwing Duck</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-whispers-in-the-well-set-art-1746511073170.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the presentation, Disney revealed that the set after Fabled will be called Whispers in the Well and it will arrive in Q4 2025. The team didn't share much, but a key art revealed Mickey, Ariel, and the likely addition of Disney Gargoyles into Lorcana. Oh, and that there is a new type of Glimmer abound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Farther out, the team finally answered many fans' calls for Darkwing Duck to be added to Lorcana as it was confirmed he will be joining the game in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Ready For the Disney Lorcana World Championship</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitve scene in Lorcana is heating up as the Disney Lorcana World Championship will take place on June 28 and 29 in Walt Disney World. This major tournament will see players from around the world competing for the envious title of the first annual Disney Lorcana TCG World Champion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans not in attendance will be able to follow along live on Twitch.TV/DisneyLorcana with a team of casters that includes Rebekah (<em>RebekahQuests</em>), Baker (<em>LorcanaVillain</em>), Liam (<em>The Illumiteers</em>), Brandon (<em>Bsquared24</em>), and JD (<em>JDZ Quest</em>). Additionally, there will be a chance to obtain a non-foil 'A Whole New World' promo card during this time, but more details will be given in the future.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/dlc-promo-a-whole-new-world-1746511087140.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tcgs">what other TCGs alongside Disney Lorcana are worth getting into</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-archazias-island-first-impressions-of-the-new-tcg-expansion">our impressions of Lorcana's Archazia's Island expansion.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> trailer illuminated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">many new details about the highly anticipated open-world game</a>, including the fact that main character Jason is absolutely shredded. The trailer opens with a shirtless Jason climbing down off the roof after doing some repairs. A close-up of Jason reveals he's got cannons for arms, a built back, and some impressive chest gains.</p><p>But how much can Jason bench? A sequence later in the trailer shows Jason on the beach, throwing up some impressive weight. In the trailer, we see Jason benching what appears to be 275lbs. Using weight plates from the amazingly fictional brand "GAINZ," we can see the outer-most plate is 25lbs. The inner ones look like 45-pound plates, so all of that weight combined with the bar (we are assuming it's the standard 45 pounds) and that comes to a mighty 275 pounds.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, a 275-pound bench is <em>impressive</em>. In gym and lifting culture, a bench press of 225 is the standard for what aspiring lifters hope to achieve. Given Jason's general buff-ness, I'm not surprised to see him putting up more, and having a well-rounded physique in general.</p><p>Also worth noting here is Jason's bench press form--it is very good. He takes the bar all the way down to his chest in a slow, controlled manner, making sure to not flare his arms out but keep the tight to his body. He also seems to not drop the weight in a straight line down to his chest. We could learn a thing or two from Jason's form.</p><p>Now, we can't say for sure what Jason's <em>best</em> bench is. It's possible Jason is not maxing out here but instead pumping for volume and muscle stamina. We do hear him grunt a little, but that doesn't mean he's struggling. He gets the weight up pretty easily, after all--earning the attention of a couple women nearby, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449" data-ratio="0.52233009708738" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449"></a><figcaption>Jason is getting after it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png"></figure><p>What I don't like to see here is Jason lifting all this weight without a spotter, or without a rack that has spotter arms. It's dangerous and unsafe to do this. But given Jason's line of work or robbing and shooting people as a drug-runner, it might be one of the safer activities he engages in.</p><p>Jason might be a gym bro, but we also see him in another sequence crashed out on the couch in the middle of the day with beers on his coffee table, so he clearly enjoys partying as well. Another scene shows Jason and Lucia at a club having a grand time. Remember, it's all about balance (minus the crime).</p><p>It's likely pumping out sets at the beach could be an activity in GTA 6, as Rockstar is known to allow players to do much of what they see in trailers for their games. Also, GTA 5 allowed players to hurl some weight around at an <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Muscle_Sands_Gym" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outdoor gym by the water</a> as well, so it would be in keeping with tradition.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.
