            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Game performance on the ROG Xbox Ally X is seemingly held back by its stock operating system, as installing Bazzite OS can lead to significant performance improvements in select games, according to a recent test.</p>



<p>The test was conducted by YouTuber <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@CyberDopamine">Cyber Dopamine</a>, who installed <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite OS</a>, which started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS on Steam Deck before becoming a great alternative OS for the system, on the newly released gaming handheld, and tested performance in two games - <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">Hogwarts Legacy.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-rog-xbox-ally-x-bazzite-os-performance-tests">ROG Xbox Ally X Bazzite OS Performance Tests</h2>



<p>In both the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios and the open-world game set in the Wizarding World developed by Avalanche Software, Bazzite OS brought significant improvements over the stock Windows OS, delivering the best results in Performance Mode (17W). In Silent Mode (13W), however, the performance difference was minimal.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Game</th><th>Power Mode </th><th>Windows Average FPS</th><th>Bazzite OS Average FPS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>47</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>35</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Turbo (35W)</td><td>60</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Performance (17W)</td><td>50</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Hogwarts Legacy</td><td>Silent (13W)</td><td>38</td><td>37</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Even when the performance difference is minimal, the ROG Xbox Ally X running Bazzite OS still seems to come out on top. The performance in both games proved to be more stable, with none of the performance spikes seen under Windows. In addition, Bazzite OS brings some quality-of-life improvements over Windows in terms of usability, with a much better and faster sleep mode that makes the handheld much more practical to use.</p>

<p>Though its stock OS brings some issues, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful and capable PC handheld, and one of the best on the market.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind</a> has lots of houses. Some of those houses house houses. House Indoril is one of those housed houses, more specifically the one to which Indoril Nevevar, the bloke Morrowind's protagonist is a reincarnation of, belonged. After about two decades of waiting, the modders behind massive project Tamriel Rebuilt are set to start dishing out Indoril membership cards with their next expansion.</p>
<p>Damn, shout the three great houses you can join in base Morrowind, the salespeople of Hlaalu, the grizzled warriors of Redoran, and the spoiled shroom-dwelling sorcerers of Telvanni. There goes our very long window to convince Vvardenfell's most capable magic gauntlet deliverer to join up with us and improve our Sotha street creed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This next expansion to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morrowinds-tamriel-rebuilt-mod-now-has-as-many-quests-as-the-base-game-and-expansions">ever-growing modding project</a> is set to add in a heartlands section of an all new Orethan region which surrounds the city of Almalexia (AKA Mournhold) on the mainland section of the province, as outlined by the devs in a teaser <a href="https://www.tamriel-rebuilt.org/content/poison-song-teaser">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"Adding the slice of Orethan Heartlands to the release unlocked one of the holy grails that TR players had been waiting for more than twenty years – the ability to join House Indoril," wrote the wonderfully-named Sultan of Rum. "Much effort had already been spent in the mid-2010s to create a unique character for House Indoril, resulting in the wonderful interactions seen in Roa Dyr in 2019’s Aanthirin expansion. A couple of years ago, however, we consolidated and largely transformed this characterization into a comprehensive design document, including a plan for a full Indoril questline."</p><p>"The addition of the Gorne and Nanaav chapels to the already extant Roa Dyr gives us three major Indoril power centers, which is enough for the first part of their overarching questline," they continued. "All three chapels will have separate relatively low-level questlines introducing you to local issues and the personalities of the ruling Indorils. Indoril Sandil of Gorne – the most forward-thinking and adaptable of the three – may agree to become your patron for real advancement in the venerable House, should you humor his fascination with the legacy of Nerevar in a series of higher-level quests."</p>
<p>As for what you can expect of the faction more generally, the modder specifies that the short answer is a battle to turn around the fortunes of Morrowind's former most powerful party, who've been left shellshocked by a deal that pesky Vivec's struck with the Empire's Tiber Septim. "Seeing the surrender of Morrowind to an outlander warlord as a cataclysm, the surviving Indoril lords have been gripped in doubt and misfunction ever since – mirroring what is happening to their patron, the goddess Almalexia," Sultan of Rum explained. "In their nihilism, they have proven unable to unite in the face of serious challenges to their hegemony, much less effectively counteract the increasingly brazen encroachment by houses Hlaalu and Telvanni."</p>
<p>And here I thought Poison Song, whose creators say they're aiming to be in the process of finalising it in "a matter of months", was gonna be all about belting out that one Alice Cooper tune with your Indoril mates. It's almost as if I should have known that theory was doomed the moment the modders reminded me in their post that Poison Song is the name of a history book in the original Morrowind.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-solix-c1000-portable-power-station-is-now-the-cheapest-it%E2%80%99s-ever-been-at-50-off-on-amazon.1330549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing power can be frustrating, whether you’re chilling at home or exploring out there in the wild. If you’re looking for a backup solution that can juice all your essentials up and is easier to carry around with you on the go, Anker makes some solid options. Even better, you can grab one of its best power stations for less right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station by 50%, bringing it down to just $398.</a> That’s a serious discount on a solution that takes care of all your energy needs, but the offer ends soon. Grab it for less while there’s still some time left.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11 Ports to Charge All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>For under $400, Solix C1000 offers 1800W of power with a 2400W peak output. Without sugarcoating anything, this is enough power to juice up pretty much all your essentials. The 11 built-in ports are a mix of AC outlets, USB-A, USB-C, and a car socket, meaning whether you’re looking to charge your smartphone or a kitchen appliance like a coffee maker, it can power it all. According to Anker’s own testing, the Solix C1000 can run a projector for up to 23.4 hours, a portable coffee maker for 2.7 hours, an electric grill for 1 hour, and even a kettle for just under an hour. You can manage everything using the Anker app on your phone. That includes checking the power status, getting low power alerts, and even customizing charging speeds using it.</p>



<p>Recharging the power station itself is fast, too. If you plug it into a wall outlet and enable UltraFast recharging via the Anker app, it can go from 0 to 80% in just 43 minutes. Prefer using solar panels to recharge? The Solix C1000 should be up and running in just 1.8 hours. Battery longevity is impressive, thanks to its LiFePO4 battery, which is rated for over 3,000 charging cycles. That translates to around 10 years of use without worrying about degradation.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the power station is surprisingly small. In fact, it is about 15% smaller than other 1kWh-class power stations. Carrying it around on your trip won’t be an issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4901/">This deal brings the price down to less than $400, after a whopping 50% discount.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this power station drop to in a long while, which is why we recommend acting fast to grab it before the deal expires.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>It just got more expensive to keep up with Warner Bros. new DC universe. Just a couple of weeks after <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 wrapped up, HBO has quietly announced another set of price hikes. The move comes shortly after CEO David Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">foreshadowed</a> putting a fresh squeeze on existing customers.</p><p>The hikes range from $1 to $2 a month, and from $10 to $20 annually. Here are the new prices, effective October 21:</p><div> <ul> <li>HBO Max Basic with ads: $11 monthly ($1 increase) / $110 yearly ($10 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Standard: $18.50 monthly ($1.50 increase) / $185 yearly ($15 increase)</li> <li>HBO Max Premium: $23 monthly ($2 increase) / $230 yearly ($20 increase)</li> </ul> <p>This latest batch of increases, which users have 30 days to decline before getting auto-renewed at the higher rate, comes just a year after the last round, which saw the standard ad-free plan and 4K ad-free plans both go up by $1 a month each. At this rate, HBO with ads will be more than HBO for cable used to be before the end of the decade.</p> <p>“I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively,” Zaslav <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-password-sharing-price-zaslav-warner-bros-2000624901">told Wall Street</a> last month.</p> <p>The latest subscriber crunch, which includes a crackdown on password sharing, comes months ahead of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>‘ debut in January 2026, followed by a raft of other new shows and movies. In other news, Warner Bros. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-of-potential-alternatives-to-maximize-shareholder-value-302590176.html">announced on Tuesday</a> that it’s happy to sell if anyone is looking to buy.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hbo-max-price-game-thrones-last-us-superman-2000637662]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing I’ve learned from the Jurassic Park movies, it’s that running a dinosaur theme park isn’t easy. It’s a constant balancing act of keeping your employees satisfied, making your park profitable, and meeting your guests’ needs, whether that means having enough bathrooms or just not getting eaten by a velociraptor. Jurassic World Evolution 3 once again puts you in the role of park manager, giving you a chance to do what the John Hammonds and Simon Masranis of the world could not: run a thriving, lucrative theme park with attention-grabbing dinosaur attractions and minimal violent deaths. With a complex set of management and customization tools, Evolution 3 gives you more control over your park than ever before. The result is an incredibly engaging management sim that’s a high point in an already satisfying series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the first two, Jurassic World Evolution 3 shares a lot of DNA with other theme park sims. You’re responsible for laying down paths and electrical infrastructure, building amenities that appeal to your clientele, and creating experiences that get more guests through your gates. Rather than roller coasters and haunted houses, though, the attractions are all about the dinosaurs. Just about any species will garner business, but having a variety is the key to long-term success — and thankfully, you’ll have a wealth of different dino types to choose from. There’s always a bit of a thrill in seeing these legendary creatures come to life, especially when you unlock the more recognizable species from the films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, when you go to Disneyland, there’s almost no chance that Mickey and the princesses will escape their enclosures and maul the park-goers. That adds an extra layer of danger to Evolution 3, and park managers will have to maintain a high safety rating to continue to pull in money. Think of it as a chill, cozy management sim punctuated by moments of panic and terror. You’ll have to keep your dinosaurs happy by meeting their food, environmental, and cohabitation needs. Some need room to roam or prefer to live in packs, while others can thrive in small areas with only a bit of pasture to nibble on. Carnivores require either fresh meat or live prey, while herbivores need greenery, fruit, and nuts. Flying and swimming dinosaurs need special enclosures, since fencing in a pteranodon is about as useful as hiding from a T-Rex in a bathroom stall. It’s really satisfying to get into a loop of researching dig sites, sending expeditions to those sites, extracting DNA, and finally, finding the perfect spot to incubate your newly discovered species. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that seems like a lot to manage, it is — but the campaign does a great job of walking you through the increasingly complex mechanics. Head of PR Cabot Finch, who you might remember from the previous Jurassic World Evolution games, returns as your guide as you visit existing parks in progress around the world and restore them to greatness. In a nod to the original Jurassic Park, the campaign begins in the Montana badlands and eventually takes you to Las Vegas, Hawaii, and throughout Europe and Asia, adding a lot of variety to the local scenery. Finch is accompanied by a team of scientists and dinosaur experts, but the real star is Jeff Goldblum’s Ian Malcolm pops up from time to time to remind everyone that trying to control nature inevitably leads to disaster.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Think of it as a cozy management sim punctuated by moments of terror. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’re already familiar with the series, the campaign mode is an effective way of familiarizing yourself with Evolution 3’s new features. The biggest addition is the introduction of in-park breeding. Previously, you could only synthesize dinosaurs based on how much of their DNA you extracted from fossils found on expeditions. Now, once you’ve synthesized compatible males and females of the same species, you can set up a cozy nesting area and wait for them to get busy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This mechanic adds a few interesting new wrinkles to the tried-and-true Jurassic World Evolution formula. You can work with your scientists to create a breeding plan, or preferably just wait and see if nature takes its course. Who knew it would be so fun to play matchmaker to a bunch of prehistoric creatures? Once the next generation hatches, juveniles might have different needs than their parents.  For example, while grown carnivores prefer to hunt their own prey, baby raptors and T-rexes will need stores of prepared meat in their pens. The tallest dinosaurs can reach the foliage on treetops, but their offspring will need nourishment closer to the ground. If you let breeding go on unchecked, pens can get overcrowded, which leads to breakouts and general panic among your guests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re managing these dinosaur family units, you’ll also have to curry favor with the entertainment, security, and conservation factions, another new feature. You can gain reputation by completing certain contracts, which are basically well-paid side missions, and improving the quality of your parks. Gaining a positive reputation with all three factions becomes very important in the last few chapters of the story, but they don’t necessarily want the same things. Pleasing them becomes yet another balancing act that adds more depth to the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign in Jurassic World Evolution 2 felt more like an extended tutorial, but this time around, you have more breathing room to find your own management style. Its objectives serve as a backbone to the overall story in which an activist group called Extinction Now! regularly hacks into your communications and sabotages your parks. As you make your way around the globe, you’ll also need to put a stop to Extinction Now!’s histrionics. The first few parks are heavily guided, but once the map opens up and you go international, you have a lot of welcome freedom to meet your objectives in whatever way you see fit. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pleasing the new factions is yet another balancing act that adds depth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of the fun of the management sim genre is being able to create something entirely from scratch, which you can do in sandbox mode. This mode has been a staple of the Jurassic World Evolution games, and Evolution 3 offers even more customization options. To start, you can choose any of the locations from the campaign, generate an island with its own unique topography, or use the square maps for a perfectly flat, obstacle-free mass of land.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have control over almost every aspect in the sandbox, including your starting funds, certain dinosaur behaviors, and beyond. You can make it more challenging for yourself with a shoestring budget or choose unlimited funding to remove all cost barriers to creating the dinosaur theme park of your dreams depending on what you are in the mood for. You can take on contracts to make extra money, but for the most part, sandbox mode is an unguided experience. It’s easy to lose track of time when you’re making sure your paths are perfectly aligned or setting up an unforgettable park tour with maximum dinosaur visibility. And unlike in the campaign, where Cabot, Malcolm, and the rest of the cast are frequently chattering at you, the sandbox is quiet and zen. Well, at least until the indoraptors get loose.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The third gameplay mode, scenarios, was my least favorite of the three. These timed challenges, which can take anywhere from 12 minutes to a couple of hours, have specific objectives and restrictions. In one, you’ll have to take manual control of one of your ranger teams and take photos of wild dinosaurs; in another, you might be barred from editing the existing dinosaur pens regardless of the well-being of those inside. I couldn’t get on board with this time-trial approach to park management; for me, it was antithetical to the zen-like experience I’m looking for in a sim, and the objectives weren’t interesting enough to make them worth the effort. I found myself missing Jurassic World Evolution 2’s Chaos Theory mode, which sadly appears to be extinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even though I didn’t personally vibe with the Scenarios, it’s impressive that Evolution 3 offers options for just about every kind of management sim fan. If you need a story to guide you through the gameplay, the campaign has you covered. If you want to build something that’s entirely your own, you can do so in the sandbox. And if you actually like high-pressure time trials, you’ll probably find Scenario mode more satisfying than I did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m even more impressed with the quality-of-life updates Evolution 3 brings to the series. With the right infrastructure, you can automate maintenance and medical care, saving you from having to manually track down those units every time there’s a crisis. Aspects that were convoluted or confusing in the previous games, like creating park tours, are far more straightforward. There are more tours to choose from beyond the standard Jeep rides and gyroscopes from the movies; you can set up a hot air balloon tour or build a Cretaceous Cruise that allows guests to canoe through rivers and lakes. Boosting your transportation score by setting up monorail stations and tracks throughout the park feels much more intuitive this time around. As you expand, you can easily edit the existing tracks to expand their reach — or just set up an underground hyperloop to make traversing the park even simpler. A lot of rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Management sim zen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I ran into a few technical issues while playing, though most of them have already been addressed by a patch. Most notably, the “continue” and “load” options were missing from the menu every time I started it up, so I had to begin a new game and load manually from there every time I wanted to get back into my ongoing campaign. This meant more long load screens and hearing the opening voiceover over a dozen times, which isn’t ideal. Again, that thankfully appears to have been fixed, but I also experienced a few crashes when trying to revisit my Indonesia park, which meant going through that same loop of starting a new game and loading all over again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another drawback of playing Evolution 3 before release is that I didn’t get to check out the community creations. Because it has so many more customization options than its predecessors, it makes sense that players would want to share their creations with the world. It’s a fun idea on paper, though I can’t say for certain whether it works in execution since there was an extremely limited player pool before launch.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">In the first Jurassic Park movie, there’s a moment when the main characters see dinosaurs in the wild for the first time and they’re almost frozen in amazement. The Jurassic World Evolution series has done an incredible job of recreating that feeling since its first installment. Seeing your first dinos leave their incubation center is always a thrill, and it gets even more exciting when your park becomes populated by pteranodons, megalodons, fierce carnivores, looming long-necked herbivores, and hybrid species that defy man and nature. Jurassic World Evolution 3 builds on an already impressive foundation to give aspiring dinosaur theme park managers more control than ever before. New features and quality-of-life updates make the third installment the pinnacle of the series, even if the Scenario mode doesn’t hold a candle to the previous game’s Chaos Theory. If building and maintaining a dinosaur theme park is your idea of a good time, Evolution 3 has plenty to offer.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has further detailed its plan to break apart or be sold. In a news release today, the media giant that owns the developers of Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter games said it has received "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties already to acquire the entirety of the company or just Warner Bros.</p><p>These parties were not named outright, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg recently reported</a> that Paramount submitted a $20/share bid for WBD, which the company rejected. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported</a> that Netflix and Comcast might be in the mix, too. Netflix already is invested in the gaming space and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">continues to ramp up its efforts</a> after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">some previous setbacks. </a></p><p>WBD said its board will "evaluate a broad range of strategic options" moving forward as it relates to the company's previously announced plan to sell the entire company or break it up in multiple sales or spin-offs.</p><p>CEO David Zaslav said he's trying to find a buyer or multiple buyers to help "unlock the full value of our assets." WBD board of directors chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. added, "We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value," but that it's important as well to "broaden" the scope of potential transactions to find a deal that pays the company the most possible money for its assets.</p><p>WBD did not set a deadline or a timetable for when it will complete this newest strategic review for these "strategic alternatives" to the previously announced separation plan. That plan, meanwhile, is booked to be completed by mid-2026, if it happens at all.</p><p>Also today, WBD announced <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-max-prices-increases-plans-2025-1236557671/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another price hike for HBO Max, and it's the third in three years.</a> WBD's stock price is soaring today, up more than 10% so far.</p><p>As for WBD's gaming efforts, the company has said it will focus on core franchises going forward with the highest potential of making money back. Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>.

The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.</p><p>One we do know about is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-691445">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which launches in 2026 from developer Traveller's Tales. As for the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is coming October 30, but it's published by Atari, not Warner Bros. A project that is not coming to market is Wonder Woman, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">WBD canceled the game and closed the studio, Monolith.</a> The company also closed Player First Games and WB San Diego earlier this year.</p><p>WBD management said the breakout success of Hogwarts Legacy gives the company the confidence that it can "get back to producing high-quality games built for long-term consumer engagement." The company said it expects its video game division to return to profitability in 2025 with the games division looking to become a "more significant contributor to growth in the years ahead."</p><p>WB's longtime gaming boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he is leaving the company but will stay on for the time being to help with the transition process.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> director Nicolas Doucet is adamant the PlayStation 5 has "really brought something special", amid criticism of this generation of hardware being an incremental improvement over the last.</p>
<p>It's been five years since Sony released the PS5, but many of its exclusives have been crossovers with - or sequels to - PS4 games. Astro Bot, however, was a showcase of the PS5's capabilities, as Doucet explained to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-ps5-generation-has-brought-something">The Game Business</a>.</p>
<p>"When you put graphics side-by-side between an end-of-lifecycle PS4 game and early cycle PS5 game, you could argue, to an untrained eye, that it's hard to see the difference," Doucet admitted.</p>

<p>"But early on [with PS5] we got the DualSense prototypes, with this haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. And we tried to understand what could be different about having this kind of trigger, so you can simulate pulling something, or cracking something, or crushing something... We tested all of that.</p><p>"When you've gone through [that process], you get to appreciate the changes," he continued. "There are some leaps, but they're maybe less obvious than when we went to HD graphics. That's something that you can just stare at the screen for a few seconds and understand. With the controller, you have to get it in your hands and get a feel for it.</p>
<p>"But I do think the PS5, between the DualSense and the SSD, really brought something special. With the SSD… I'm thinking of things like the Souls games, where you die a lot. And when you die, you used to have to wait a long time before you get a second try. With the SSD, that becomes really, really fast. So, in terms of just the pleasure of play, that's really increased."</p>
<p>What's more, Team Asobi is focused on PS5 exclusive games, despite Sony releasing its first party games on PC.</p>
<p>"We really focus on PS5," said Doucet. "We want to take full advantage of the DualSense and SSD. There is always a way to cross bridges if we ever need it. But really, the main focus is on the PlayStation console."</p>
<p>Doucet also prefers console development as it avoids incompatibility issues with varying PC setups.</p>
<p>"It's specific hardware that is absolutely set," Doucet said of the PS5. "You know that what you see in your office making the game, is definitely what people will see in their home playing the game. That allows us to focus, because you're not putting in time dealing with compatibility or permutations. It's why I've always liked consoles."</p>
<p>Further, Doucet discussed the length of Astro Bot too, and the benefits of developing a more concise, focused experience.</p>
<p>While there is a "minimum scope" for a project to be considered a full game, the team didn't want to spread itself too thin.</p>
<p>"We use the analogy of food," Doucet explained. "When you're really hungry, if I propose to go to a buffet, you can eat anything you like and that's going to sound appealing. But as you go through that meal, maybe by the end of it you've eaten too much and you almost regret it and you don't necessarily appreciate what's left, and maybe you keep a lukewarm memory of it.</p><p>"Whereas if we go to a place where it's going to be just enough, you're going to keep a good memory and maybe you want more. The way we think of it is to not overload the player so that in the end they feel fed up."</p>
<p>Doucet's comments<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success"> echo his own from GDC earlier this year</a>, where he stated it's "OK to make a small game". "A lot of choices we made with Astro Bot could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter," he said. "We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>
<p>Which games do you think prove the success of the PS5? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p>It’s Jackbox Party Pack time once again, and can you believe we’re on Jackbox 11 now? How time flies. It feels like it was only last year that the JPP was barely learning to walk. , this time around brings five brand-new games into the fray, and while they do all feel familiar, it’s one of the strongest Party Packs in recent years, thanks to some really good execution.</p>
<p><iframe title="GAMEPLAY TRAILER | The Jackbox Party Pack 11 | Available OCT 23" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8IwlJvXhgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Doominate is this time around’s writing game. It has you and your friends trying to ruin different phrases, people, or things by putting a spin on them. This can be very clever, and it was for the most part, but it is also the game most likely to end up with you and your friends sending yourselves to hell as fast as possible by exposing your sins. The execution here is a lot of fun though, and while the Death character in this is a little unfunny, the overall presentation is really good.</p>



<p>Hear Say is my standout, but it’s also the most awkward of the bunch. You and your mates need to make stupid sound effects for this one, with prompts including things like trying to make a sound like gargling mouthwash, to doing a Miss Piggy vocal warm-up. This is about as close to Dropout’s Make Some Noise as we’re going to get in video game form, and it’s a blast online. The mini-games are bad in it though, and the game would be better without them.</p>

<p>I do also think that there’s a divide between playing online and in-person. You can mute your online mics when playing online, which means you can keep all of your sound effects that you’re making a surprise, which feels preferable to everyone being in the same room and already hearing what others are doing, and potentially also ending up in the background of each other’s takes. For as boisterous as it wants you to be, there’s also that awkwardness of public performance.</p>

<p>The obligatory drawing game comes in the form of Cookie Haus, which&nbsp;has you all glazing cookies in different shapes and naming them. The commitment to icing physics adds to the entertaining feeling of the whole affair, and pandering to the weird requests of the customers is a good time all around. Trying to work around the weird shapes you end up with really helps boost your creativity as well.</p>

<p>Suspectives bring a little social deduction to the table, as between four and eight people try to fool each other and catch the criminal among you. You start off having to answer a slew of survey questions, which then provide the basis for back and forth of interrogation, evidence, debate and voting phases, as you try to narrow down the main suspects. It’s a fun time, but it definitely helps to be pretty close friends and family through this, though you could obviously fib during the initial surveys. It’s also potentially the trickiest mode to organise and play. It really benefits from having the higher player count, but game nights are difficult to organise when everyone in your friend group now has kids to argue with over whether it’s bedtime or not.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ve got Legends of Trivia, which is easily the best trivia game we’ve had in ages. This has you all working cooperatively to defeat all manner of beasts in RPG-alike combat, and eventually find the legendary Bookwyrm. The questions are varied in topic, delivery, and style, and there’s an extra strategic layer of being able to split your answers if you’re uncertain, and item management that helps make this an absolute blast to play. I normally dislike the trivia games, but Legends of Trivia sets an entirely new standard for them all.</p>

		If Jackbox Party Pack 11 is anything to go by, then the second decade of Jackbox is going to be great. There's a familiar feel to the pack as a whole, but it's really well put together and there's a great injection of noisy new ideas.	</p></div>

			<p>Ukrainian developer Frogwares announced that its next project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sinking City 2</a>, is being moved to the first half of 2026. The first and most tragic reason is the continued assault on Ukraine by the Russian Federation, with the developers having to deal with power loss on top of the constant worry for their own safety. Sergiy Oganesyan, Head of Publishing at Frogwares, stated:</p>



<p><em>Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to. At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone's guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time. </em></p>

<p>The development of The Sinking City 2 is also going slower because Frogwares is shifting the sequel's genre from the first installment's action/adventure to survival horror. Lead Game Designer Alexander Gresko explained:</p>



<p><em>Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation adventures for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episode 1 & 2 Impressions - A Tale to Tell]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions-a-tale-to-tell.1330498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Telltale Games created a formula for adventure games that, when done well, is a near-perfect way to absorb a narrative interactively. So many have failed to do it right since their heyday, even Telltale themselves, that releases in that episodic choice-driven style have been few and far between. From what I can tell, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/dispatch-is-episodic-workplace-comedy-first-iterating-where-telltale-refused-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch </em>has taken all the right lessons</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dispatch </em>is set in a world of superheroes, where they are so abundant they even solve the world’s pettiest problems and crimes, like de-escalating an argument over someone cutting in line.</p>

<p>You play as Robert Robertson, a former hero who does not have superpowers, who gets a job at a dispatch center for superheroes. You’re tasked with managing a team of still-reforming supervillains to fight crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At its core, <em>Dispatch </em>is a classic workplace comedy set in an absurd world. Weird powers lead to weird personalities, and powerful people will have powerful egos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with the style of Telltale adventure games, <em>Dispatch </em>will be readily familiar to you immediately. There are some QTEs during scenes (which you can turn off), and many dialogue choices will be met with a “so and so will remember that” in the corner of your screen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest deviation, and I suppose this may change in future episodes, is that there’s no roaming around or character control. It’s all cutscenes, dialogue, and then some other added gameplay elements I’ll get into with specific episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really, large chunks of <em>Dispatch </em>are like an interactive TV show, which bears out in the playtime with each episode being about an hour (so far anyway). There’s still some interesting gameplay going on, however.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 1 – Pivot&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The first episode gives you all the setup for the world and the character you play, Robert Robertson. He is the third generation of Mecha Man, both his father and grandfather dying as heroes as they served the Southland area of Los Angeles. They were well-beloved, leaving quite the legacy for Robert to live up to.</p>

<p>As the episode starts with the history of the world and your character, we get to see Mecha Man in action. Hot on the tail of Shroud, the villain that killed Robert's father, we infiltrate a steel mill full of his goons.</p>

<p>Things don’t go well, and Robert survive,s but his Mecha Man suit does not. Without that, he can’t be a hero anymore, as he has no powers. And as you see his apartment in the opening minutes of the game... Robert's not exactly flush with cash for repairs.</p>

<p>The story goes on from there, but I don’t want to go into the plot too much to let you experience it yourself. Robert's motivations and personality come through from the opening seconds of the game, and the history of Mecha Man does a great job of showing just how important being Mecha Man is to him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One scene is a perfect example of why the episode works and sets up what we're in for with <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

<p>The scene takes place in a bar for superheroes, which does a great job of showing you the world of <em>Dispatch</em>. Heroes are so mundane, so numerous that this isn't some elite club -- just a bar in a normal neighborhood. The decor looks like it'd be a decent stand-in for a bar just about anywhere.</p>

<p>In the scene prior, we're introduced to Blonde Blazer, who rescues the suitless Mecha Man from some thieves who were beating the hell out of Robert until she got there. She takes him to the bar for Robert to unwind and get to know him.</p>

<p>Blonde Blazer works for Superhero Dispatch Network, and you eventually learn that she's there to learn a little about Robert to evaluate whether he'd be a good fit for the company. Considering the name of the game, he turns out to be a pretty good fit.</p>

<p>The scene is pretty short but efficient and effective. The quick interactions with Blonde Blazer and a couple of other characters in the bar and just the setting of the bar itself set up the main thrust of the story, introduce hugely important characters, give you a great sense of the world, and shows you the exact sort of tone and humor to expect from the game.</p>

<p>Of the humor, there's one specific joke I want to talk about in this episode. I think the humor mostly sort of works this episode, but some fall flat for similar reasons as this next one.</p>



<p>The thieves Blonde Blazer helped Robert with were all wearing different colored beanies, so Robert jokingly refers to them as skittles. At the bar, Blonde Blazer laughs, saying she hadn't even noticed that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert replies, “you know what they can taste the rainbow in jail.” Fine enough joke that mostly works. Decent setup, decent payoff.</p>

<p>Then Blonde Blazer says, “What do you mean? Like different colored dicks?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, so close. This sort of wink-wink, nudge-nudge moment comes up a few times in Episode 1. They just don't end up working and feel like a prude's attempt at crude humor sometimes. Having played some more of <em>Dispatch</em>, particularly the next episode, I think it falls into a better groove where the irreverent humor lands most of the time.</p>

<p>If you’re reading a few impressions or reviews on <em>Dispatch</em>, I imagine there’s going to be a lot of <em>The Boys&nbsp;</em>comparisons. The crude humor with shocking visuals is somewhat in <em>Dispatch</em>, but at a much lower level. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Very early on, you fight a guy who is naked with penis flapping in the wind throughout the fight. Because it happens so early, you'd think there would be more things like it. There's really not, though.</p>



<p>It feels like <em>Dispatch </em>wants to dip its toes in every so often, coming across like its a kid getting away with something than embracing the joke. So, the inevitable <em>The Boy</em>s comparisons don't work for me, as <em>The Boys</em> commits to its identity fully and forcefully. <em>Dispatch </em>just wants to be naughty every so often.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Episode 1 does a great job setting up the world of Dispatch and introducing some of the major characters.</p>

<h2>Episode 2 - Onboard</h2>

<p>I'm glad Episode 2 is coming out at the same time as 1, as there's still a whole lot more of the world to learn and characters to meet.</p>

<p>Here, Robert finally gets to work as a dispatcher, and you’re introduced to the team of heroes you’ll be working with. "Hero" may be overstating how to describe them, as they're a bunch of still-reforming villains. Nicknamed the Z Team, they're not the easiest to work with.</p>

<p>One is a man who looks like a bat but can turn more bat-like at times -- he's smart and a former finance criminal. One's a hothead who controls fire, another an arrogant gal who turns invisible -- the list goes on, but suffice to say they are all very vocal and have some loose morals.</p>



<p>Episode 2&nbsp; is where some more gameplay elements enter as well, as you will be dispatching your team to various calls, from fights, to kaijus, to security details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team members have unique stats, with some better at fighting, others who are smarter, etc. They can level up and you can put to improve stats as you see fit, and there are even some unique abilities they can gain too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each call for dispatch will give you some keywords and descriptions to give you a hint as to what stats may be better suited for a job. Depending on what you choose, you’ll see a graph like the above where the orange area shows what the hero or team of heroes covers on that graph, and the white area shows what you need to cover. The white part is revealed after you choose, of course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the time, you won’t cover it all, so you’re at the whims of a bouncing ball in the white area that you hope eventually ends in the area you have covered, or you'll fail.</p>



<p>Sending heroes to calls, them handling the call, and then returning to base from calls all take time, making you have to juggle a lot of things at once. Calls are on the board for a limited time before you automatically fail them, and you don't want to be caught out with no one to send. Or worse, having only one or two to send that are obviously not suited for the call.</p>

<p>It’s all pretty simple, so don’t expect anything too crazy.&nbsp;<em>Dispatch </em>will just throw a lot of choices and timers at you at once. It's engaging the entire time, and it’s certainly never boring.</p>

<p>While all that is going on, there are a lot of entertaining conversations on the team, whether it's a comment on the call they're sent to, who they're paired with, or just some random conversation as everything is going on. It really lets the all-star cast of incredible voice acting shine.</p>



<p>The other bit of gameplay is how Robert can more directly help the team through hacking. These are presented as little puzzles where you open up pathways to move around and collect information or codes you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hacking is simple at first, but they do add some more elements, like some of them being timed, virus protection that chases you around the pathways as you try to quickly input a code, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how you feel about some quick, simple puzzling, I think your mileage will vary. There’s nothing there to wow you, but there are a few standout ones that directly involve members of your team that ratchet the tension nicely. Like quickly hacking some water tanks that may douse you're fire-powered hero on the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, Episode 2 is where everything started to gel completely. The cast of characters is fun, and dispatching is totally engaging, making the time fly by. Episode 2 is great at making the huge cast shine, and that's where the game's greatest strength lies.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the opening of <em>Dispatch</em>. While it may be less interactive than the Telltale games of old, <em>Dispatch </em>streamlines how you interact with its narrative and makes the gameplay elements intrinsic to the game itself. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As a one-two opener, it's a great opening. Episode 1 spends a lot of time with Robert, the main character, and the second episode sets up the gameplay and huge cast of characters, putting its "secret sauce" of incredible voice talent front and center.</p>

<p>This is a style of game that I think people yearning for more of that Telltale goodness from years ago will be very satisfied with. I can't wait for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-killed-adam-driver%E2%80%99s-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason.1330486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kylo Ren/Ben Solo actor Adam Driver recently revealed that after working on the sequel trilogy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797"><em>Star Wars</em> films</a>, he and acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh pitched a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie to Lucasfilm. But because the movie was set after <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-okay-lets-talk-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skyw-1840561224">2019’s<em> Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and starred Ben Solo, who dies at the end of that film, Disney allegedly passed on the project, which was tentatively named <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/adam-driver-star-wars-soderbergh-jarmusch-4e08164d0419759f1b5b50d69864975d">In a new interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>,</a> Driver talked about his career, his love of working with talented filmmakers, and the struggle to get projects funded and approved. And during this conversation, he talked about a previously unknown<em> Star Wars</em> film that he and Soderbergh were pitching to Lucasfilm and Disney around 2021.</p>

 <p>“I always was interested in doing another <em>Star Wars</em>,” Driver told the <em>AP</em>. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. [Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second. I loved [Kylo Ren] and loved playing him.”</p>

  <p>So Driver teamed up with director Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt to create an outline for a film that would star Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo, who in the sequel trilogy has fallen to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren. However, by the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker,</em> Solo has redeemed himself, turned good, and eventually sacrifices his life to save Rey’s. Apparently, according to Driver, Lucasfilm execs loved it. So the group hired Scott Z. Burns to write a full script, which Driver told the <em>AP</em> was “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.” Next, it was time to pitch the movie to Disney. And that’s when it all fell apart.</p>

 <p>“We took it to [Disney CEO] Bob Iger and [Disney co-chairman] Alan Bergman, and they said no,” said Driver. “They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that. It was called <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo,</em> and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”</p>

 <p>The AP reached out to Soderbergh, who confirmed Driver’s story and added, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”</p> <p>According to Driver, the plan was to be “judicial” and “economical” with the proposed film’s budget, and for it to be in the “same spirit” <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311">as older <em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, which are “handmade and character driven.” But sadly, Disney didn’t want to bring back Ben Solo. Meanwhile, remember when Disney brought the fucking Emperor back to life because it gave up on the sequel trilogy’s main villains halfway through? We live in the worst timeline.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Wednesday, but don’t let a little midweek madness stop you from continuing your NYT Connections streak with another successful puzzle. I’ve got the hints and solutions you need to get through today’s puzzle as quickly as possible. Don’t forget to leave a comment or join the Insider Gaming Discord server to let us know how your streak is going!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections hints you need today! </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-22">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 22)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #864:</p>



<ul>
<li>FASHION</li>



<li>WRITER</li>



<li>PASTA</li>



<li>SHAPE</li>

<li>GAS</li>



<li>CARPENTER</li>



<li>ELECTRIC</li>



<li>MOLD</li>



<li>TELEPHONE</li>



<li>CAT</li>



<li>RIGHT</li>



<li>ARMY</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>What keeps your home humming?</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Custom-made or cleverly reshaped</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Tiny workers with big titles</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Duplication in all its quirky forms</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 22.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Discovery Announces Sale Bid, Potentially Impacting Game Divisions]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-discovery-announces-sale-bid-potentially-impacting-game-divisions.1330480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is officially up for sale, following the suspected breakdown of a deal between the firm and Paramount Global, which has dropped into the rearview. The news broke today that the board of directors at WBD has kick-started a ‘review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.’</p>



<p>In a press release, the firm revealed it had received ‘unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company’. Earlier this year, Warner Bros. Games started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-restructures-around-its-core-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a restructuring effort</a> to focus on core franchises including Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, Gme of Thrones, and the DC Universe, and if WBD <strong>is sold</strong>, those efforts will come into question.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-happen-if-warner-bros-discovery-is-sold">What Will Happen if Warner Bros. Discovery is Sold?</h2>



<p>If Warner Bros. Discovery is sold, the stock price will become volatile, content licensing deals and studio operations will be reshuffled, and brands might have their faces changed. This is all just as likely to impact Warner Bros. Discovery’s television and movie arms, such as HBO and Discovery+, as it is the <strong>gaming </strong>arms.</p>



<p>Under the Warner Bros. Discovery header sit multiple studios, all of which could be up in the air if a mega-sized corporation swoops in and buys the company. We could see studios shut down or split off, fragmented, or have their operations altered drastically.</p>



<p>This would be the natural course after the evaluation and review of spending, costs, and the portfolio under Warner Bros. Games.</p>



<p>Time and again, we’ve seen large companies swallowed up by <strong>even larger companies, </strong>and the action is almost always followed by project cancellations, layoffs, and studio shutdowns.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-initiates-review-potential-alternatives-maximize-shareholder-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Warner Bros. Discovery reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While&nbsp;Warner Bros. Discovery (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:&nbsp;WBD) continues to advance its previously announced separation of Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, its Board of Directors today announced it has initiated a review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, in light of unsolicited interest the Company has received from multiple parties for both the entire company and Warner Bros.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>This suggests the previously reported split has now evolved into an outright sale.</em></p>



<p>CEO and President, David Zaslav, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We continue to make important strides to position our business to succeed in today’s evolving media landscape by advancing our strategic initiatives, returning our studios to industry leadership, and scaling HBO Max globally. We took the bold step of preparing to separate the Company into two distinct, leading media companies, Warner Bros. and Discovery Global, because we strongly believed this was the best path forward.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that the significant value of our portfolio is receiving increased recognition by others in the market. After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think there will be drastic changes thrown into the mix if WBD is sold? What do you think this means for the studios under the WBD label? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

However, the team determined that it needed more time to finish the game on its own terms, citing the ongoing war in Ukraine and the significant genre shift of the sequel compared to their previous titles as reasons for the delay.</p><p>“Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to,” Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. “At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning… These things all slowed us down regularly to the point where it just doesn’t make sense to try to rush what we have left to meet a date that we no longer feel is worth chasing. How Moscow’s tactics to terrorize civilians will change again as winter comes is anyone’s guess, so we’d rather be ready to adapt again, knowing we’re able to take our time.”</p><p>Frogwares lead game designer Alexander Gresko added, “Switching to survival horror for the first time has been a whole new kind of challenge for us in itself, too. We’ve been making investigation <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,633 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for more than twenty years, but survival horror asks for a completely different kind of design thinking. Tension, pacing, combat, etc. We’ve always loved the genre as fans, but once you start building it yourself, you realize how much you still have to do. It’s exciting, but it definitely makes development slower.”</p><p>Oganesyan continued, “We don’t have an exact date set for 2026 yet, but we thought it was better to at least share what we do know. We’d rather be certain than announce something now only to move it again. Rest assured, we’re currently aiming for the first half of 2026, so it’s a matter of months, not years.”</p><p>Frogwares also shared 13 new screenshots showcasing the game’s setting, enemies, and atmosphere, as well as promised that it will be “showing a lot more gameplay over the next few months.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

        <p><strong>Abolished Systems for Fair Competition / Mouse Controls</strong></p><p>“Next, I’d like to explain some of the systems we decided to remove in order to ensure fair competition across all platforms,” LEVEL-5 CEO Akihiro Hino explained. “First were the features we had originally designed specifically for Switch—switching between portrait and landscape modes, and stylus controls. These would be difficult to implement on other platforms, so we decided to remove them in consideration of the game’s cross-play specifications.</p><p>“Instead, the game will support mouse controls. At launch, mouse controls will be supported across Switch 2 and PC. Mouse controls will be added to the PlayStation 5 version via an update. Mouse controls will not be available on Switch and PlayStation 4. On Switch 2, the mouse controls are supported via the packed-in Joy-Cons.”</p><p><em>(Editor’s Note: It is likely the Xbox Series version will also receive the mouse support update. Hino never specifically mentions the Xbox version in the broadcast, even when talking about the system specifications above when the information was listed on-screen.)</em></p><p><strong>Player Bank / Potential Sequel</strong></p><p>“The game will feature over 5,400 characters, but collecting them all won’t be easy,” Hino said. “We don’t know how long it’ll take to collect them all—it could take an absurdly long time. So we’ve added the ability to carry over your save data to the next game.”</p><p>Hino continued, “To explain in greater detail, the characters you collect can be stored in a save area called the Player Bank. You’ll manage your players by transferring them between the Player Bank and your main save data. That being said, it’s not complicated, and isn’t much different from leaving your characters at a tavern in other <a title="Genres > RPG [17,718 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>.</p><p>“However, there are alternate versions of the same characters with different abilities, so there’s a chance that even storage for 5,400 characters might not be enough.

                <p>Lovecraftian survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/">The Sinking City 2</a> has been delayed to 2026, as Frogwares says that the ongoing war in Ukraine and its ambitious design goals for the sequel will have necessitated more development time. While a concrete release date hasn't been set yet, the studio says it is aiming to have the game out in the first half of 2026.</p><p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning."</p><p>Lead game designer Alexander Gresko also added that The Sinking City's 2 shift toward a full-fledged survival-horror direction has also slowed the team down, as it has to learn a "completely different kind of design thinking" for the game. To make up for the delay, the studio revealed 13 new screenshots for The Sinking City 2, showing off more of the game's setting and enemies that players will encounter. Frogwares also plans to reveal a fresh look at the game soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

                <p>A new report has shed light on Electronic Arts' use of AI, revealing a company that's implementing the technology in everything from game development to performance reviews. EA's position? Employees should view AI as a "thought partner."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report from Business Insider</a>, EA's top brass over the past year has urged its nearly 15,000 workers to use AI for everything from coding and concept art to scripting conversations around performance reviews and promotions. Internal documents Business Insider obtained showed some workers are not just expected to take multiple AI training courses, but also use AI daily to expedite work, with the idea that the tech is a "thought partner."</p><p>The company's in-house chatbot, ReefGPT, is one of the tools EA is pushing onto its workers. However, people Business Insider spoke to on the condition of anonymity said this chatbot produces flawed code and other hallucinations, creating more work that clogs production. Other people Business Insider spoke to said EA is expecting creative staff to train AI on their work, instilling a fear that the company may then facilitate a downsizing that could cut talent such as artists and level designers.</p><p>A laid-off Respawn Entertainment senior quality-assurance designer told Business Insider that AI basically did his job--reviewing and summarizing playtesters' feedback--which is why he believes he was cut from EA this spring, along with nearly 100 others.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">EA warned of "legal and reputational" risks</a> around the industry's mass adoption of AI, saying consumers could "lose confidence in our business and brands" if the technology isn't managed appropriately.</p><p>The company was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased (pending regulatory approval) by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">one of the largest sales in the business sector</a> that--much like EA's AI use--raises some ethical questions.</p>

            <p>Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is "disappointed" the now defunct Ridgeline Games was not credited in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, despite its contribution being "the foundation of the game".</p>
<p>EA's Ridgeline Games, which worked on Battlefield 6's story campaign, was led by Lehto, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-game-director-marcus-letho-leaves-ea-and-ridgeline-games">he departed in February 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">the studio closed</a> shortly after. "Gut punched to see EA lay off my team," he said at the time. "So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise."</p>
<p>Now, following Battlefield 6's release, Lehto has commented on the lack of inclusion for Ridgeline in the game's credits. "I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcus-lehto-7378b31_im-disappointed-to-see-that-many-of-my-former-activity-7386081189645885440-Q38B">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for one to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits - and several were omitted entirely, including myself."</p>
<p>Lehto embedded an image in the post crediting his colleagues at Ridgeline "as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits".</p>
<p>He concluded: "Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has requested comment from EA, to ask if staff will be added to the credits in a future patch.</p>
<p>Since release, Battlefield 6 has been regularly updated with tweaks. In particular, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-developers-u-turn-on-a-multiplayer-adjustment-following-community-feedback">U-turned on an adjustment to the game's multiplayer Conquest mode</a> following criticism from players.</p>
<p>Following his departure from Ridgeline Games, Lehto - who previously worked extensively at Bungie on the Halo series - revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-battlefield-director-doesnt-have-anything-positive-to-say-about-ea">he didn't "have anything positive to say about EA"</a>, in particular due to "industry sweeping layoffs".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-passes-payday-2-maintenance-onto-sidetrack-games-to-focus-more-on-payday-3.1330441/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Starbreeze Entertainment is passing the torch of maintaining Payday 2 onto Sidetrack Games, so that Starbreeze can focus more on Payday 3. Sidetrack Games will take over future updates for Payday 2, including fixing any bugs that may come along, adding quality-of-life updates, and just overall keeping the game running and live for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>"<em>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the Payday modding community</em>," Starbreeze writes in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/553504715299620867">announcement on the Payday 2 Steam page</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Their work on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/RAID_World_War_II/">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. They know the Payday 2 engine inside and out, and they've already gotten started</em>. <em>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23, and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows Starbreeze to maintain full focus on Payday 3, while Payday 2 continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We've partnered with Sidetrack Games to support PD 2 on PC! They have roots in the modding community, and we have trust they'll bring the game back to life!</p><p>Starting Oct. 23 the first update will come out, and they'll be focusing on QoL updates to start: <a href="https://t.co/JjEpneo71b">https://t.co/JjEpneo71b</a> <a href="https://t.co/USU6I0lU2H">pic.twitter.com/USU6I0lU2H</a></p></div>— PAYDAY 3 (@PAYDAYGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1980620480500383832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Starbreeze also states that it'll host a live stream on Thursday, where it will delve further into the details around its collaboration with Sidetrack Games.</p>



<p>This is the latest update for Payday 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-introduces-a-payday-2-subscription-that-lets-you-access-almost-every-dlc-for-5-month/">since the DLC subscription service</a> that Starbreeze introduced, and later had to apologize for due to Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-admits-mistake-payday-2-subscription-infamous-collection-bundle/">also decreasing the discount on the Infamous Collection</a> for Payday 2. Basically, it made the previous avenue for acquiring all of Payday 2's DLC more expensive, to make the subscription service more appealing. Starbreeze restored the Infamous Collection discount to where it was before the subscription service was released.</p>



<p>As for where Payday 3 fits into this, it's clear that Starbreeze wants to focus its efforts on making Payday 3 more appealing for Payday fans, since many of them still haven't moved off of Payday 2. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">cancelled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based co-op game</a> in order to focus more on Payday 3, and now it has passed off maintaining Payday 2 to put more time into Payday 3.</p>



<p>However, even with the extra space to work on Payday 3, it'll still take years for it to be anything close to what Payday 2 is. The sheer quantity of DLCs available to Payday 2 players will take years to match, never mind just hitting the same quality bar as the ones players love in Payday 2. Payday 3 also, as far as we know, still won't include everything that players want from it, now that Starbreeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/starbreeze-no-longer-developing-payday-3-offline-mode-not-feasible-for-studio/">has confirmed it won't be working on an offline mode for the game</a>.</p>



<p>In any case, Starbreeze seems committed to making up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/payday-3-bringing-the-big-buck/">the abysmal launch that Payday 3 had</a>, which was plagued by scores of technical and server connection issues, and a gross lack of content. We'll see where Payday 3 stands a year from now, and if Starbreeze has begun to make inroads in their journey to make Payday fans play Payday 3, which, two years after release, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/#1y">struggles to get more than 3K concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>If you’re rushing to grab the latest round of free-ish games included in October’s PS Plus Extra or Premium bundle, you might want to slow your horses slightly and double-check that you aren’t about to accidentally lose your ownership of one of the games forever. Due to an ongoing bug with the PlayStation’s current subscription service, if you previously picked up PS Plus Essential’s giveaway of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> in 2022, downloading it again today will erase your license to own it completely!</p> <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This issue is pointed out by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/10/21/ps-plus-extra-essential-yakuza-like-a-dragon-game-license/"><em>PlayStation Lifestyle</em>‘s Zarmena Khan</a>, who has been trying to raise awareness of this hefty problem ever since Sony relaunched its PS Plus service three years ago. It boils down like this: Back in the day, when you downloaded the monthly freebies from PS Plus Essential, they were yours to keep for so long as you maintained your subscription. It was a great deal, and made logging in at the start of a month—well—essential. However, in 2022 this changed, with PS Plus shifting to be more like Microsoft’s Game Pass, such that the games are only accessible to play so long as they remain a part of the PS Plus catalog. Once they’re gone from there, you can no longer play them without paying for the full version. The problem is, if you picked up a game via the Essential service and then re-download it via the modern PS Plus, your original license is permanently overwritten and you’ll lose access to a game you previously owned once its time on the sub comes to an end. And that’s pretty bad!</p>

 <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This month makes this issue particularly relevant, with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which was originally given away as part of PS Plus Essential in August 2022, now available in the catalog. Reddit user kabirsingh84 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1obn64b/reminder_if_you_claimed_the_ps_plus_essential/">first raised the concern yesterday</a>, reminding people that the PS Plus Extra version that arrives today will delete your license.</p>

   <p>So before you grab it—and indeed any other game added to the PS Plus subscription—make sure to check your library to see if you picked it up any time before 2022. It’s so easy to have grabbed all three games in any given month, forgot you ever did, and then too easily lose your ongoing right to play it.</p> <p>Of course, this all shines a bright light on the degree to which <a href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">we increasingly don’t own the majority of the games we play, or even buy</a>, as consumer rights are eroded by deeply dubious digital licenses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-out-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-before-the-black-friday-rush-while-apple-sticks-to-full-price.1330426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is slim. It measures in at under a quarter inch thick. Beyond that, you’re getting the quintessential Samsung Galaxy experience with this phone.&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy S25 family of phones come in a few different storage capacity options plus a whole slew of colors, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/">but right now the Edge model with 512GB is deeply on sale. You’ll save 40% on the specifically the titanium silver and titanium jet black options</a>. They normally go for $1,220, but the discount brings them down by $490. That makes it so you only have to pay $730 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Just because this model phone is extra thin, doesn’t mean it’s sacrificing any toughness. Each is made with a durable titanium build along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 face.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Photography</h2>
<p>Despite how thin the phone is, the S25 Edge is still able to pack in Samsung’s powerful 200MP camera. You can capture every stunning detail with the highest resolution camera on any Galaxy phone. It also includes and ultra wide auto-focus 12MP camera plus the 12MP selfie camera on the front.</p>
<p>One of the more practical uses of Galaxy AI integration in the S25 Edge is when it comes to the camera. The Samsung smartphone employs a feature called Best Face. You ever set up to take a group photo, snap a bunch in a row, then look back through them only to see there’s something wrong with each of them? Maybe Jolie blinked in the first, then Daniel got distracted and turned his head in the next. None of them are post-worthy. Well, Best Face can intelligently take everyone’s best look across all the photos and stitch them together into one perfect shot. It only takes a few seconds and can provide results for group photos of up to five people.</p>



<p>Selfies are also elevated when taken on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Galaxy AI can recognize your environment’s lighting and capture accurate skin tone, balancing the levels on the fly without any extra editing.</p>
<p>Finding photos through your camera roll has also been made easier. If you’re trying to find a specific pic you took, you can just describe it in your search to have Galaxy AI dig through your photos to bring you to it. Like maybe you dress your dog up as a Dracula for Halloween but you don’t remember what year that was. Just type in “vampire dog” and it should come up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise</span></a><span> is an excellent propaganda machine. Thanks to the anime focusing so heavily on the powerful bond between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash and his starter Pokémon, Pikachu</span></a><span>, everyone feels like they </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to love their first partner in each game. These cute little guys are typically given to you by a professor, and they serve as an early foundation for the rest of the team you’ll build out over the course of the game. But sometimes, you’ll boot one of these games up and realize you don’t like any of your options. Then you’re stuck with this hangnail of a Pokémon you don’t really care about. Friends, what if I told you that there’s another option? One that most trainers, chained down by sentimentality, never even consider? Put that little shit in the box and catch your actual fave.</span></p> <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game comes out, fans decide which of the three starter monsters they’ll be taking out on their adventure. These fire, water, and grass-type Pokémon are meant to give new players a sense of the series’ rock-paper-scissors-style types and weaknesses, and usually end up being faces of the franchise for a few years until the next game comes out. The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games, however, have handled this a bit differently. Instead of three new critters to start your journey with, these experimental spin-off RPGs bring back old starters from previous games, but with a new twist. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>gives Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt’s final stages regional variants, and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>gives Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, however, has gotten a bit of flak for its starter choice which includes Chikorita and Tepig, arguably two of the least popular starters in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>history even though they are both my special babies who have never done anything wrong. So if you fire up a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game only to find yourself greeted with three Pokémon you’re not particularly thrilled about, are you just forced to use them for several dozen hours? No, my friend. That’s just what Big Pokémon Company wants you to think.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005417"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005417">The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While I’ve never boxed a starter during my initial playthrough, I’m no stranger to treating my game-sanctioned first partner like any other Pokémon on my team. That’s because the second I boot up one of these games, I’m looking for my real starter: a Pichu or PIkachu. My favorite Pokémon is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, and because it’s the evolved form of the series’ mascot, my basic ass has the wonderful privilege of knowing my favorite boy is going to be in most games (we don’t talk about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i></a><span>). So every time I pick a starter in these games, I know they’re going to end up playing second fiddle to my electric rat. I learned at an early age that I don’t have to believe the lie that my starter has to be my best friend, because they’re often just a placeholder for the little yellow guy in my mind. That was true in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. I picked Chikorita, and when he evolved into Meganium, he was a surprise MVP of my playthrough thanks to the new grass/fairy-type Mega Evolution. But even though my time in Lumiose City began with this Pokémon, he didn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be in my party any longer than it took me to catch another critter. In fact, most games barely acknowledge the starter after you initially get one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, we have one of the more underwhelming starter line-ups ever, at least for people who hate good and cute babies like Chikorita and Tepig, with Totodile being far and away </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-half-of-you-are-picking-totodile-as-your-pokemon-legends-z-a-starter"><span>the most popular of the trio</span></a><span>. What if you don’t need a water-type Pokémon in your party because your favorite is Gyarados? Did Totodile’s ugly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution after it becomes Feraligatr</span></a><span> put you off the blue dude altogether? The secret no one at Game Freak wants you to know is that you can put that little guy in a box and make a party that has no starters in it at all. Hell, take it a step further and release that red-headed stepchild back into the wild. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-crossdress-clothing-options-gender-2000637336"><span>Taunie and Urbain</span></a><span> don’t have to know you sent their Pokémon down the street with a bindle. Break free of the chains of decades of Ash and Pikachu brainwashing and write your own story.</span></p>

              <p>Dating isn’t easy. Especially if you happen to be a poor female soul cursed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAQspWt0aOL99lsGPeQp6Hnw_mspQEqDwgAKgcICjCO64oDMJavPA&amp;utm_content=related&amp;gaa_at=g&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj2070ceV5niWLiExz7RE6uqIscvHvFTwlASZjfdaIZDJ2TwX8FRRCWk55LxUyicaxQPQ25azo74ocH5pU8rHhCmNd0l0SrXjkLvZyd&amp;gaa_ts=68817188&amp;gaa_sig=FDeQQB0pPPY6GmEQ04nFWesgmVcQDaCT4UAJeHrOWle61WGf2D-tp0pqldaLrNruTgZ6mi9JxAvwOFLYbm0xWQ%3D%3D">wanting to date men</a> (it’s me, I am poor female soul). When they don’t seem checked out, they’re busy telling you the elaborate details of how their marriage collapsed over intimacy issues. Or confiding in you about their secret plans to make everyone in their polycule very unhappy. Maybe they won’t stop talking about video games (which can go either way, really). Or, as upcoming indie narrative game <i>DateBoy</i> simulates, maybe the guy you’re dating won’t stop <i>playing</i> video games. Ugh, my eyes are up here, buddy.</p> <p>Developed by brothers Anton and Henri Pätsi, <i>DateBoy</i> casts you in the role of a boy on a date at an Italian restaurant who is Checked Out™, too busy playing video games under the table while his off-screen date struggles to carry on a conversation. It’s a free narrative game out on Steam and Itch.io next month and it looks delightfully amusing. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezkq3qqwUu4">the trailer here</a>:</p>

  <p>Essentially you play as a dude on a date, trying to play a platformer that bears a passing resemblance to <i>Gimmick!</i> on a device that’s probably legally distinct from a certain beloved late ‘90s handheld console. While hopping around in the platformer, you’ll have to try and keep up with the usual, tired dating conversational topics such as “How was your day?” with opportunities to deliver those one-word answers that us girls <i>love </i>hearing on a night out.</p> <p>Oh well. At least there’s pizza.</p> <p>The game promises to be no longer than half an hour. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4022300/DateBoy/">The Steam listing</a> makes for an amusing read, too. So if you’re looking for what seems to be a cute narrative joint, maybe mark this one on your calendar and try not to stand it up.</p>

                <p>Silent Hill has once again cemented itself as one of the biggest survival-horror franchises, thanks to critically acclaimed releases like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake in 2024 and the recent launch of Silent Hill F. Both games--and an interactive streaming series called Silent Hill Townfall--were first announced in a 2022 livestream, and series producer Motoi Okamoto recently spoke about how this was a deliberate move on Konami's part to show fans of the franchise that it was committed to reviving Silent Hill.</p><p>"Three years ago, in 2022, we announced three titles--Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, and Silent Hill: Townfall," Okamoto said in a <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979174851308032466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a> (via an <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-series-producer-says-publishers-cant-expect-players-to-get-serious-about-an-ip-with-just-remakes/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> translation). "We didn't want to just announce a single remake to 'test the waters.' We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series. Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen."</p>

<p>Okamoto added that players would not feel motivated to give a new game in a long-running series a chance if the company behind it was adopting a "wait-and-see" approach, and only by approaching the IP with a serious intent could it get the fanbase for that game to engage with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/">Silent Hill F</a> have been critically acclaimed entries in the franchise, and there's still more to come.
