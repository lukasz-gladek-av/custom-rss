<p>As a private and generally secretive company, Valve doesn't offer much outside visibility into its inner workings. So when years' worth of data on the company's employee and aggregate payroll numbers leaked recently, we were eager to take a deep dive to see what those numbers could tell us about the operation and evolution of a company that <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/steam-statistics.html">has a hand in the majority of PC gaming transactions</a>.</p>
<p>The recent data comes from a poorly redacted document in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/judge-brings-dismissed-steam-antitrust-lawsuit-back-from-the-dead/">Wolfire's antitrust lawsuit against Steam</a>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962">first noticed over the weekend by SteamDB's Pavel Djundik</a>. While the key data in the document has now been properly hidden in the court docket, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">The Verge captured the raw numbers</a> from a table labeled "Employee Headcount and Gross Pay Data, 2003-2021."
</p><p>Breaking down that data by year and department with some simple graphs and statistics, seen below, gives us outsiders a rare partial glimpse into Valve's organization. All told, it's a bit hard to believe that this lynchpin of the PC gaming world has rested on the work of just a few hundred people for many years now.</p>

<p>It's striking to consider just how small Valve is compared to other major players in the game industry. In 2021, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/piershr/status/1704084070169280658">estimated Valve's annual revenue at $6.5 billion</a>, roughly on the same scale as <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/electronic-arts-ea-earnings-madden-nfl-1235994653/">EA's $7.5 billion in 2024 revenue</a>. But Steam achieved those numbers with around 350 employees, compared to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-cutting-5-of-workforce">well over 13,000 people employed by EA</a>.</p>
<p>The disparity highlights just how much money Valve brings in with a relatively small workforce. And a lot of that is thanks to the chunk of revenue Valve takes from every sale on Steam. The dominant PC gaming marketplace has seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ars-analysis-80-of-steam-games-earn-under-5k-in-first-two-weeks/">a massive increase in the number of annual game releases</a> since 2012 or so, thanks to initiatives like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/a-100-lottery-ticket-indies-discuss-steam-greenlights-new-fee/">Steam Greenlight</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/valve-says-goodbye-to-steam-greenlight-hello-to-direct-publishing/">Steam Direct</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Yet, surprisingly, the size of the "Steam" department inside Valve has shrunk in recent years, from a peak of 142 employees in 2015 down to just 79 in 2021. From the outside, having just 79 employees keeping track of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases">more than 11,000 Steam releases in 2021</a> is a pretty incredible ratio.</p>
<p>Some readers may also be surprised that Valve's "Games" department has represented a majority of the company's headcount since 2003. That has remained true (though to a lesser extent) even in more recent years, as Valve's output of new games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Valve_games">has become much more occasional</a>. It seems likely a large number of those Games department employees are devoted to ultra-popular Valve games like <em>Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, which enjoy tens of millions of players and need significant support work.</p>

<p>The leaked data also shows the slow rise of Valve's small Hardware department, which started with just three employees in 2011 as the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/rumor-valve-potentially-working-on-a-steam-box-console-with-partners/">began work</a> on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">doomed Steam Machines initiative</a>. Transitioning into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">the Valve Index era</a> in the late 2010s, the hardware department still represented just a few dozen people and a paltry 3 to 4 percent of the company's annual payroll.
</p><p>By the time we hit 2021 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the run-up to the Steam Deck</a>, the Hardware division still makes up just 12 percent of Valve's small total headcount. Looking back, it's impressive that such a small team was able to create a portable gaming device that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">quickly spawned</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/new-steam-deck-competitor-lets-you-easily-swap-in-more-ram-storage/">whole micro-industry</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">imitators</a>. We can only hope the Hardware team got a little more employee support in the wake of the Steam Deck's market success.</p>
<p>"We are relatively recently a hardware company," Valve's Greg Coomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-interview-valves-designers-on-all-things-hardware-software-and-knowing-when-to-stop">told Rock Paper Shotgun in 2021</a>. "And our DNA is really in software where upgrading stuff, it takes as long as writing some code and shipping it on the internet. So the people who work here, you know, we've hired a ton of experts in the hardware field who have all been slowly teaching us, 'You can't really operate the same way in hardware and just upgrade things whenever you feel like it.'"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24199846/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review-switch-speedrunning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are few things I know better than <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. Over the last few decades, I’ve replayed the game across basically every Nintendo platform, exploring its levels over and over, searching out each and every secret. But there’s one thing I never paid attention to: the timer. I’ve always taken a slow, methodical approach to the game, ignoring the tiny countdown clock. That changed with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151970/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch-release-date"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a>, a collection of NES classics that have been chopped into pieces in the interest of pure speed. It showed me a new side to games I thought I knew intimately.</p><p>Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_World_Championships">Nintendo’s occasional in-person esports competition</a>, the collection takes 13 of the company’s most iconic titles and divides them into more than 150 different challenges. Instead of playing through a game in its entirety, though, you’re experiencing brief moments, with the aim of completing them as quickly as possible. It’s speedrunning for beginners. And it turns familiar games into something faster and more compulsive.</p><p>It starts simple. The initial challenge I played in the solo mode involved getting the mushroom in the first level of the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. After that, I was swallowing an enemy as Kirby, running to the first ladder in <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and collecting the morph ball in <em>Metroid</em>. The earliest pieces are like a tutorial for the basics of how to play each game. Most only last a few seconds. You can even watch a short playthrough video before jumping in, so you know exactly what the goal is.</p><p>Completing a level gets you a score based on your speed as well as some in-game currency you can use to unlock more challenges. It’s a pretty steady progression: you start out doing the very basics, before moving on to completing whole levels or defeating bosses. Eventually, things get <em>really</em> hard. And the structure is pretty open, so you can tackle games in the given order or jump around as you see fit. I found myself initially sticking to old favorites like <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Mario </em>before braving the clunkier titles like <em>Balloon Fight</em> or <em>Ice Climber</em>.</p><p>But even when doing challenges for a game I’ve already played many times before, I’ve found myself playing them differently, which is sort of obvious since the goal here is entirely speed, but I was surprised by how quickly I became really competitive — even with myself. When playing solo, the screen is divided into two: on the left is your current playthrough, and on the right, a recording of your current fastest time. I’m typically not much of a perfectionist, but I’ve been playing challenges repeatedly just to shave a few tenths of a second off my time and get the coveted S rating. Part of this is because everything is so immediate; it only takes a second to restart a challenge and go again.</p><p>For games like <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, this has forced me to abandon old habits. There’s no point wasting time collecting unnecessary power-ups or defeating enemies. Instead, I have to find the cleanest line through a level, which usually means avoiding almost everything and making sure I nail my jumps. Meanwhile, the repetition helped me appreciate other games I previously didn’t have much patience for.</p><p>I have always struggled with the twitchy sword fighting in <em>The Adventure of Link</em>, for example, so the challenges around combat were intimidating. But much like beating your head against a wall with an <em>Elden Ring</em> boss, I found myself slowly learning how and when to attack, and I actually got better at the game. The collection hasn’t changed my mind about everything, though. In fact, I might hate <em>Balloon Fight</em> even more after attempting some of the “master” challenges.</p><p>This structure makes for a great party experience. You can play with up to eight people locally, and things get chaotic, with the screen showing everyone’s gameplay simultaneously. This introduces the added difficulty of paying attention to only your playthrough amid everything else happening onscreen, not to mention the inevitable yelling happening IRL. There’s also an online component. In the one mode I was able to test, five challenges will be available each week, and you can replay them as many times as you want to claim a place on the leaderboards. I haven’t found this mode as fun as playing solo or with people in person, but it will be eye-opening seeing how good some players are.</p><p>As much as I have enjoyed playing the part of a speedrunner, the collection is probably best paired with an actual NES or a subscription to Switch Online and its retro games. It has given me a strong urge to replay many of these classics by instilling in me a new sense of confidence: now, I might finally be able to beat <em>The Adventure of Link</em> and its skeleton knights, or <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>’ devious sequel with its poison mushrooms. More than anything, though, I’m excited to have a new excuse to play through <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> again — with one eye on the timer.</p><p><small>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition<em> launches on July 18th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</h5><p><span>July 18, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>You just never know what Nintendo is going to tap for nostalgia next. The Nintendo World Championships are a concept the company has revisited in a scattershot way over the years, but it’s the original 1990 iteration most folks remember, and really, it’s not even the event itself that’s most famous. That first competition was held using unique NES cartridges, which are now the ultimate collector’s item <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/nintendo-world-championship-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetching upwards of $25,000 apiece</a>. <em>That’s</em> the main reason the Nintendo World Championships are still remembered today. Despite that somewhat obscure legacy, the Nintendo World Championships are returning once again, this time as an actual widely-available video game.</p>
<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition offers a series of challenges derived from a slate of 8-bit classics, but will they have you running and jumping for joy? Or does Nintendo miss the podium this time around? Limber up your thumbs, it's time to find out...</p>

<p>While Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition purports to follow in the footsteps of The Big N’s competitions of old, the real inspiration for the title seems to be the modern speedrunning scene. While the original 90s Nintendo World Championships, and most of the iterations that followed, were all about high scores, this new game is about doing things <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>NWC: NES Edition serves up over 150 discrete challenges, drawn from 13 first-party 8-bit Nintendo titles (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3, and the Lost Levels, The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Metroid, Kirby's Adventure, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Excitebike, Balloon Fight, and Donkey Kong, to be exact). It’s a solid lineup, if a bit by-the-books and missing third-party favorites like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Battletoads. Your performance in each challenge is rated, with coins being awarded for improving your best times and letter grades. You can then use those coins to unlock more challenges and simple cosmetics like icons and badges for your online profile.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Challenges start extremely simple – grab a mushroom as Mario, suck up an enemy as Kirby, ect. – but increase in complexity until you’re being asked to complete entire stages. Eventually, you’ll unlock a final “Legend Challenge” for each game, which, in a cute touch, are accompanied by simple strategy guides. In the case of the original Super Mario Bros., you’re tasked with doing a true speedrun of the entire game, but sadly, that’s an exception rather than the rule. While other Legend Challenges remain fairly daunting, they’re definitely more limited – the Mario 3 challenge asks you to complete the game’s first world, the Metroid challenge only consists of the final escape sequence, ect. This sense that Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is kind of toying around with the concept of speedrunning, without fully embracing it, kind of pervades the whole package.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships4-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The games play pretty much like they did back in the day, with optional on-screen controls and prompts for those who want to get back up to speed quickly. While I’m sure true retro fanatics and speedrunners will find differences and anomalies between the true original NES games and these versions, for the most part, this is a “warts and all” presentation, with slowdown, glitches, et all still present and accounted for.</p>
<p>When playing solo to improve your best times, you’ll usually be looking at two screens (unless you opt against that in the options). The left shows your current run, the right your previous best run so you can see at a glance how you’re measuring up. There are some handy features built into the game, like an automatic rewind that kicks in when you die (beware though, it <em>doesn’t</em> rewind your timer). It’s a solid setup, but lacks a lot of options that would make it more appealing and versatile for those already into this kind of speedrunning gameplay. For instance, you can’t manually rewind your run if mess up a sequence, your only option is to start the whole challenge over again. Also, in addition to not being able to play through whole games, you have no way to stake out your own unique challenges. The 150-some included in the package is all you get.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The limitations of NWC: NES Edition extend to its online component. While having “World Championships” in its title would seem to imply the game has a direct competitive element, it’s not really the case. World Championships Mode presents a series of five challenges, refreshed every week, that you can work towards perfecting your times in. When the deadline arrives, your place on the leaderboards will be revealed, but until then, you won’t know. While I suppose this approach may keep people coming back to the game, I’d personally prefer a simple leaderboard for each of the game’s challenges.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Survival Mode somewhat simulates the feeling of competition, although, in this case, you’re only going up against other players’ ghost data. You "compete" against 7 ghosts over three rounds, with half of the field with the worst times being eliminated after each challenge. If you want realtime competition, Party Mode, which is essentially a live, local version of Survival Mode, is actually your best bet. Party Mode is fun in a casual sort of way, but, realistically, your rivals probably aren't going to provide much challenge unless they also have the game and have been practicing.</p>

<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition isn’t hurting for content, even if said content is nigh-on 40 years old, but I'm just not sure I see the long-term appeal of this package. Serious speedrunners will probably barely give the game a bemused glance, and for Nintendo's $30 asking price, more casual players could get a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online subscription and play full versions of all these games as much as they’d like, which feels like more of a winning strategy to me.</p>

<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition presents a promising concept, but a lack of features to support either dedicated speedrunners or any sort of serious online competition limits the package's appeal. There's certainly fun to be had revisiting this lineup of golden oldies, but Nintendo has only scored a bronze at the Nostalgia Olympics this time around.</p>

					<p>Nearly five years after the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ashen-not-dark-but-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashen</a>, Wellington-based game developer A44 is about to launch its second game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas Ashen was published by indie label Annapurna Interactive and brought up from the ID@Xbox program as an Xbox/PC exclusive at first, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn enjoys a raised profile and a full multiplatform launch from the get-go with publisher Kepler Interactive. A44 also doubled in size to make it, bolstering its headcount from 30 to 60 developers, which is admittedly still on the lower end for a developer looking to craft a game not too far from triple-A production levels.</p>
<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn follows in the footsteps of its predecessor in many ways but also departs from it in others. It's still largely inspired by the Soulslike genre created by FromSoftware, so you can expect bonfire-like Lodestones and camps as checkpoints, having only one chance to gather your lost experience (called reputation here) if you are defeated before it is gone forever, and a set amount of potions that only recharges after resting at camps; which, however, respawns all regular foes in the world.</p>
<p>However, it is much more accessible for those who, like myself, aren't too keen on standard Soulslikes. To start with, A44 did not shy away from adding a difficulty selection, unlike FromSoftware. While the mere mention of it may sound borderline heretical to diehard fans of Dark Souls and Elden Ring, the Japanese studio's refusal to allow easier settings in their games keeps a good chunk of would-be fans from enjoying those titles. There's a reason why the 'easy' (or rather, normal) difficulty mods are extremely popular on PC, while console users are forced to go through the ordeal as-is or simply walk away.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Flintlock-Screen-2-HD-standard-width-3833px-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No such thing is necessary in Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, which offers three options when starting a new game: Story (which disables Achievements), Normal (described as balanced but challenging), and Possessed, which delivers something more akin to the punishing experience Souls fans have come to love and hate at once. But there's more: players can also fast travel at will and without any cost to any unlocked Lodestone or camp.</p>
<p>Overall, when playing on Normal, I felt none of the trademark frustration usually tied to the experience of playing a Soulslike game. Granted, there were a few tougher boss fights and enemies that required some tactical adjustments to be overcome, but that's par for the course for any action RPG like God of War, which is also an inspiration for this game. In the review guide, A44 mentioned the desire to position Flintlock as an entry point for the genre that prides itself on not being unfair to players. In this regard, the game passes with flying colors.</p>
<p>It's great that the game is so accessible. This way, players will have the chance to experience a truly unique fantasy world inspired by the rather niche titular Flintlock genre. In this type of setting, firearms and black powder are just as prevalent as magical beings, and that's exactly what you'll find here.</p>
<p>Protagonist Nor Vanek (voiced by Olive Gray, who you might remember as Miranda Keyes in the Halo TV series) is a Sapper, trained since a young age (she was a war orphan) to be part of an elite combat engineering unit within The Coalition army. The Coalition is all that stands between the army of the Dead that has been pouring out of the city of Dawn for the past ten years. At the beginning of the game, his adoptive father, Baz (voiced by Elias Toufexis, known to gamers for playing Adam Jensen in the last two Deus Ex games), goes on a suicide mission with a couple more members of the Sapper unit to bomb the Door to the Great Below, in a desperate attempt to stop the flow of undead. Being highly protective of Nor, he leaves her behind - but she rushes to join the squad as soon as she learns of their endeavor.</p>
<p>The team does appear to succeed at blowing up the Door, but this creates new problems instead of fixing anything. Namely, a few nasty gods escape and cause all sorts of trouble throughout the world (which is a peculiar mix of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Middle Easterner, and New Zealander influences). Furthermore, Nor herself is initially separated from the Sapper unit. However, she finds a new, mysterious companion, the fox-like god Enki (voiced by Alistair Petrie, mostly known for playing General Draven in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). Despite her initial mistrust of any god, Nor eventually agrees to work with Enki to defeat those rampaging gods. By the way, if you're worried about Enki being as annoying as Forspoken's Cuff, I can reassure you that's not the case at all.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/A44GAMES_FLINTLOCK_SCREENSHOT_0006-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While not exactly full of twists, the story, told through conventional dialogue and cinematics rather than FromSoftware's cryptic ways, is ultimately enjoyable. Critically, the developers made the cast of supporting characters interesting despite only dedicating a modest amount of quest content to them. While I certainly support the definition of Soulslite for Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn when it comes to being a leaner, more accessible version of Soulslike, the game is perhaps a bit too 'light' on content in general.</p>
<p>A44 claimed a length of 20 hours plus another 10 for completionists, but Steam says I finished the game in just 14.7 hours, and the achievements confirm I completed all side quests, freed all hamlets, unlocked all firearms, found all Enki feathers (which level up your companion for better performance in combat), and fully upgraded my campsite. The side content was pretty good, but there was so little of it compared to the usual action RPG that it's hard not to be a little disappointed, particularly if you're having fun. Granted, the game has a budget price of $39.99, but you're still left wanting at the end.</p>
<p>That extends to character progression. You can obtain new armor and weapons (both melee and ranged), but there's only a handful of them throughout the entire game. The same goes for the skill tree, which lets you specialize in Steel (melee), Black Powder (Ranged), or Magic (gracefully provided by Enki), though you will most likely end up with a mix of all three, given how small the tree is. On the bright side, you can experiment with skills more easily than in other games, as Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn lets you 'unlearn' a skill while refunding a good amount of reputation to invest elsewhere.</p>
<p>Overall, the game's combat is relatively fast-paced and requires full usage of Nor Vanek's tools. For example, an unblockable (red) attack can be dodged, but a better option might be to use your trusty firearm, as that will stun the enemy for a brief time. There are also grenades and various types of firearms, including a cannon and a flamethrower.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FLINTLOCK_Gameplay_SCREENSHOT_UHD_003-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Traversal is also pretty fun, taking advantage of a high degree of verticality in the design of the maps. The developers previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-has-spider-man-like-traversal-and-soulslike-combat-says-a44-games-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> it as Spider-Man-like, although I'm not sure that's accurate. In Spider-Man's games, you can move more or less freely while web-swinging, whereas here, you're just zipping in a predetermined path through magical rifts. Still, it's a good way to reach some secret areas and fully explore the world.</p>
<p>Visually, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn looks good without being mind-blowing. It is powered by Unreal Engine 4; an upgrade to UE5 could have done wonders for the game, not only for the visuals with the likes of Lumen and Nanite but mostly for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-2-out-now-adds-improvements-to-anti-stuttering-system-enhances-lumen-and-nanite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stuttering improvements introduced by Epic</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game suffers from the stuttering seen in many UE4 games released in the past two years. Mind you, it's not nearly as bad as The Callisto Protocol, but it's there, even when playing on a PC with an RTX 4090 and NVIDIA DLSS 3 enabled.</p>

<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is an enjoyable and highly accessible Soulslite. A44 created a great entry point for the genre, not to mention an exciting fantasy setting that mixes black powder, magic, and influences that go beyond the usual European medieval style. The combat is fun and won't cause you to break any controllers. The story is also worth following, although the game perhaps end up too soon, leaving narrative and gameplay possibilities to be explored by a sequel.</p>

After convincing Nor of his seemingly good, though mysterious, intentions following the cataclysmic event that sends the world spiraling into chaos, Enki grants Nor the gift of magic as well as companionship as the two set out to make things right in the world. </p><p>Those magical abilities provide Nor with the ability to deal extra forms of damage and unleash status effects on her enemies, as well as traverse the world through triangular rift gates to access new areas and speed along on trips through previous routes. The core structure is standard soulslike: You explore the world to take on challenging foes, earning a form of experience as you do to level up your character. Die and you drop all the experience you have on you until you return to reclaim it. Die before reclaiming the experience and it’s lost forever. Study your enemies’ moves carefully, strike when the time is right, block, parry, and dodge to ward off their attacks, and you just might make it through alive. </p><p>Where <em>Flintlock </em>departs from many of its genre siblings is that here, you almost certainly <em>will</em> survive because, though it has much in common with the likes of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>, it’s remarkably more forgiving across its three adjustable difficulty modes, one of which allows you to turn on infinite health. Though a lower level of difficulty might not exactly be an irresistible siren’s call for those <em>Souls </em>fans who love the genre for its robust challenge, by lowering the difficulty threshold, <em>Flintlock </em>may allow more players to experience the very good action on offer here. Make no mistake, the game is still very happy to knock you on your ass if you’re charging in recklessly, but importantly, the combat, more often than not, feels like it wants you to have fun. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree </em>Review: Massive, Menacing, And Magnificent</a></span></p><p>In providing a less punishing challenge, <em>Flintlock</em> isn’t just concerned with showing you that you, too, can overcome difficult gameplay.

But oh, dear reader, I didn’t feel that way at first. I’m very happy to say that <em>Flintlock</em> grew on me, but it had to claw its way out of some <em>bad</em> first impressions.</p><h2 id="h237318"><a id=""></a>A rough start to a rough world</h2><p>In my first hour or two of <em>Flintlock</em>, I didn’t think we were going to get along. I’d bemoan playing this game to coworkers, friends, and even once on a date. And while I did come to appreciate elements of the narrative by the end, I’m not convinced <em>Flintlock</em> introduces its story, world, and characters very well. </p><p><em>Flintlock</em> rushes through essential opening moments in a way that prevented me from fully soaking in all the important, foundational story beats. As a result, I spent much of the game not really understanding exactly what was going on. Sure, it was clear that there were undead. There were bad gods. Humanity was in a shitty state. Enki was maybe a trustworthy friend? At the very least, he was beyond adorable.</p><figure id="" data-id="9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-recommend-id="image://9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-recommend-id="image://9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game was eager to talk about what was going on as if I <em>should</em> know, but it was rough. I reached a point where I just accepted what I was supposed to do: Gods bad. Swing ax and shoot. But it felt like I was just being swept along in a story whose basics had gone over my head . An in-game glossary or codex of some kind that could define basic terms or give me a running summary of events would’ve dramatically improved this. </p><p>Part of my misunderstanding, I suspect, was due to <em>Flintlock</em>’s very unfortunate audio treatment. While A44 did stress that the pre-release build I had access to during my review (which was mostly issue-free aside from a strange, non-game-breaking UI bug) didn’t have adjustable “2D cinematic audio,” there were issues with the sound that I worry a day-one patch might not be able to fix.</p><p>It was remarkably difficult to hear what characters were saying at times. I repeatedly dove into the audio settings to try and address this, but more often than not, characters would sound muffled and distant. And even when the voices were direct, there was a strange timbre to the audio recordings that made it hard for me to understand them. I had to turn the subtitles on and leave them on for the whole game.</p><figure id="" data-id="5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-recommend-id="image://5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-recommend-id="image://5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Flintlock</em> also has frequent ambient character dialogue between Nor and Enki, almost to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forspoken-review-dialogue-rpg-square-frey-open-world-1850048781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forspoken-review-dialogue-rpg-square-frey-open-world-1850048781"><em>Forspoken</em></a></span> levels of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forspoken-chatter-cuff-best-settings-parkour-1850029744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forspoken-chatter-cuff-best-settings-parkour-1850029744">persistent chatter</a></span> (seriously, Enki, stop commenting every time I pickup crafting materials or jump into rifts).

The volume levels of sound effects and music were all over the place. I’d knock down the music a few times because it was too loud. Then, despite my lowering it, it would sometimes soar to incredibly high levels, leading me to either turn my speakers down or once again dive into the settings. </p><p>Sound effects across the board were equally uneven. Oftentimes, they would just erupt in remarkably loud and abrasive ways (and that’s coming from someone who enjoys loud, abrasive music and sounds). </p><p>It’s a shame because the fundamental quality of the sounds and the soundtrack are quite good (boss fight music in particular, though often too loud, is well-written and evocative). They’re just mixed and presented in a way that doesn’t showcase their foundational strengths.

But it amounts to more than just an on-ramp to this kind of game. While I’m now looking at my calendar to figure out how to schedule in some quality personal time with other games of this kind, I’m sad I won’t be playing more <em>Flintlock</em>, at least not without a New Game Plus option, which the game currently lacks. </p><p>Nor gets a melee weapon—an ax or hammer—along with a black powder gun that recharges its ammo as you land successful hits. You also have access to more powerful rifles, grenade launchers, and other armaments that typically require you to manually reload each shot and can be aimed like a gun in a standard, over-the-shoulder third-person shooter. Firearms do decent damage on their own at times, but they’re also very useful for stopping an enemy from unleashing a more powerful, unblockable attack. And when you’re in the heat of a boss fight and manage to manually reload a black powder rifle just in time to bring it up to aim, fire, and stop them from hitting you with a devastating blow, it’s great fun every time. </p><figure id="" data-id="a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nor’s companion, Enki, provides her with magical augmentation to her attacks.

As you defeat enemies and pull off successful combat maneuvers, you’ll earn Reputation that you can spend on upgrading your proficiency with firearms, magic, and melee weapons. You lose the Reputation you’re carrying around if you die twice without recovering it. That part’s pretty standard. But what’s unique is that during combat, you build up Reputation in a separate meter, where it’s increased by a percentage multiplier that goes up as you continue to land successful hits and dodge attacks. You can pull your Reputation out of that separate meter at any time to “cash it in,” as it were, by holding a button, or you can choose to let it build up and increase in value as you continue to play the game more proficiently. Get hit, and the multiplier gets reset, adding what Reputation you earned to your current total. The longer you’re able to sustain your Reputation multiplier by avoiding damage, the more you’ll earn. </p><figure id="" data-id="b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-recommend-id="image://b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-recommend-id="image://b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This mechanic encourages you to do better in combat in more ways than just punishing you with death should you fail. The HUD indicates the successful combat moves you pull off, and you come to learn the system pretty well while playing, picking up on ways to avoid hits and find better openings to land attacks. By the end of the game, its benefits were less about the experience multiplier, and more about helping me conceptualize the fighting in a way that I expect will cross over to other games in the genre. <em>Flintlock</em>’s mechanics are well composed and easy to understand, helping you sustain the highs of doing well in a hard action RPG rather than learning from suffering crushing lows too often. </p><p>That said, it is an easier game than many it takes clear inspiration from, both in its lower level of difficulty and its systems that encourage you to play smarter. In my single run of the campaign, I died less than a dozen times and only switched to easy mode because I encountered a boss whose second phase was so hectic, it was beyond anything the game had taught me to fight before. Still, though it was relatively easy, I still feel like I learned a combat system that had nuance and interesting challenges. And I was eager for more.</p><p>Unfortunately, as soon as I really got into the groove of this combat system, and was starting to finally catch up with a story that felt like it had left me behind, the game was nearing its conclusion. </p><figure id="" data-id="4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-recommend-id="image://4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-recommend-id="image://4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I ultimately completed it in about 10 hours with a full run of the story and a sizable chunk of the side quests. Some might delight at the prospect of such a short, manageable runtime, especially as many modern games seemingly want to occupy endless hours. But I’d argue that <em>Flintlock</em> deserves to last longer on the merits of its own satisfying, approachable, and fun gameplay loop.</p><p>The game features an introductory sequence, two semi-open-world environments filled with enemies, camps to liberate, coffee shops to visit, side-quests, and a conclusion. I so wish <em>Flintlock</em> would’ve had at least one more semi-open world environment to explore. The game sells for less than $40 brand new, but I don’t feel like I want more <em>Flintlock</em> for the sake of value. I want more <em>Flintlock</em> to play more <em>Flintlock</em>. </p><h2 id="h237320"><a id=""></a><em>Flintlock </em>deserves more, now and hopefully later</h2><p><em>Flintlock</em> won’t provide you with your next “get gud” level of challenge. It’s not an invitation to bark down at people who don’t have the time or experience to invest in harder games over “skill issues.” I was a bit let down by some of its presentational issues and murky storytelling, but in the end, I found myself just wanting more of this combat. <em>Flintlock</em> has encouraged me to jump further into a genre that used to turn me off. If you’ve struggled with the soulslike genre in the past, you might find this game to do the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-recommend-id="image://20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-recommend-id="image://20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it’s not just the combat. The setting and world design is very inspired, with some gorgeous art and wonderful environmental designs. Nor and Enki’s discussions as they explore the world bring up topics of human traditions in response to the duality of life and death. There’s personality and heart at the core of <em>Flintlock</em> that I’d like more of, and that’s especially welcome considering how cryptic and austere games in this genre often are. I found the ending to be a little ambiguous, perhaps hinting that there’s more story to tell. And I really hope that’s the case. I want to see more of these characters, this world. They deserve more time on screen.</p><p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> has its issues, but I think A44 Games has hit upon something special here, creating both an approachable form of soulslike gameplay and a unique, non-conventional fantasy setting that isn’t just another pseudo-European medieval landscape dominated by white men. The game could’ve really reached something greater with an extra five or so hours of gameplay. But what’s on offer here is a low barrier to entry for a genre that is often too eager to delight in your misery. <br></p><p><strong>Buy <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flintlock-Siege-Dawn-Deluxe-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CN3TQMRN/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CN3TQMRN" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-announcement-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that another Game Pass announcement will arrive soon when announcing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-new-titles-coming-to-game-pass-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new titles for their game catalogue</a>. Many speculate that this tease could be related to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 arriving on Game Pass, along with other Activision Blizzard titles. A prominent leaker believes that another mystery title will be coming with MW3 to Game Pass, and that game is Dave the Diver.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recognized Xbox leaks source eXtas1s corroborated Insider Gaming’s report that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will arrive on Game Pass this month in their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXefXBCiP4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a>. In the same video, eXtas1s discusses another game arriving with the popular FPS game, Mintrocket’s casual, single-player adventure RPG, Dave the Diver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be strategic for Xbox to include Dave the Diver in its Game Pass library. Since its initial release, the game has gained significant popularity and garnered multiple prestigious awards. Furthermore, it was recently featured on PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5 users. This aligns with the prevailing industry trend, where games introduced on PS Plus often become available on Game Pass and vice versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-dave-the-diver">About Dave the Diver</h2>



<p>Dave the Diver is a casual adventure RPG cum management simulator which features deep sea exploration. The game will have you exploring the ocean’s depths, fishing during the day, and managing a sushi restaurant at night. During your journey, you will catch many types of fish, upgrade and craft new equipment, find treasure, and unravel the mysteries of the ever-changing Blue Hole.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>The endurance racing management simulator, GT Racing, is set to launch in early access on September 3rd, available on Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG. GT Manager challenges players to create and manage an endurance racing team from scratch, overseeing all aspects of running the team such as finances, driver and staff recruitment, securing sponsorships, and track performance during racing events.</p>
<p><iframe title="GT Manager - Gameplay Trailer &amp; Early Access announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8H4Y6Na9CaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><i><span>“As you progress, the game evolves, revealing layers of complexity and strategic depth across its five distinct categories. It’s a journey that starts with accessible fun and grows into a rich, multifaceted challenge that will test players’ management skills to the fullest.”, </span></i><span>said Stéphane Baudet, Creative Director at The Tiny Digital Factory.</span></p>
<p>The key features of GT Manager include:</p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Transform a regional factory into a tech powerhouse with cutting-edge facilities and research departments</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Scout talents, recruit top engineers, and train your crew for perfect pit stops</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Research and develop new parts to make your car unbeatable on the track, balancing performance and reliability in the pursuit of perfection</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Practice between races to customise every aspect of your car’s performance on every track of the championship and under various weather conditions</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Oversee team budget and investments with an extensive financial board to balance the books</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Anticipate opponents’ moves and make crucial calls on pit stops, fuel level, tyre strategy, and driver pace to maximise your chance of victory</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Make split-second decisions to capitalise on race incidents, yellow flags,&nbsp; and weather changes</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Featuring 25 official racing cars across the GT4, GT3, GT2, GTE, and Hypercar categories, new cars will be added to the game during Early access.</span></em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em><span>Cars officially licensed from Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Aston Martin, Peugeot, Alpine, Lotus, Ford, Glickenhaus, Chevrolet, Corvette, Brabham, Bugatti, KTM and Saleen.</span></em></li>
</ul>
<p>During the early access phase, GT Manager will be priced at <span>€19.99, but the price will rise to €24.99 when the game exits early access. The current price is for the Deluxe Edition and this includes the Aston Martin Valkyrie AMR Pro and Bugatti Bolide.</span></p>

            <p>
UK spending on video games plummeted by 29.4 percent during the first half of this year, while music and video sales grew. 
</p>
<p>
Physical game sales fell by 40 percent to £111.7m compared to the first six months of 2023, while digital download sales fell 23 percent to £236.9m.
</p>
<p>
The numbers, reported by the Digital Entertainment and Retail Association (<a href="https://www.eraltd.org/music-outpaces-video-and-games-in-first-half-of-2024-with-sales-revenues-up-7-9">ERA</a>), reflect a "soft new release schedule", according to its latest report.

<p>
"It was a tough first half for the games business with a lack of heavy-hitting releases, but we are optimistic for a strong second half, the traditional time for blockbuster releases," ERA boss Kim Bayley said. 
</p>
<p>
The first half of 2023 notably included the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for Nintendo Switch. Compare that to the first six months of this year, and there's nothing of quite the same scale. Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth for PlayStation 5 was perhaps the most notable launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">though sales haven't matched its predecessor</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As Bayley notes, however, a slew of 2024 blockbusters are on the horizon - including Star Wars Outlaws in August, EA Sports FC 25 and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom in September, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in October, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
UK spending on both music (including vinyl, CD and downloads) and video (including DVD, Blu-Ray, digital) both grew over the same period. 
</p>
<p>
Music sales grew by 7.9 percent, driven by Record Store Day and the launch of new Taylor Swift breakup album The Tortured Poets Department, including its lead single Fortnight (nothing to do with Fortnite). 
</p>
<p>
Video sales also grew, despite declining sales for physical media (that sounds familiar!). A drop in DVD and Blu-ray spending was offset by growth in video downloads and digital sales - which does not include money spent on streaming subscriptions to Netflix, Amazon or Disney+.

Still, despite video games' sizable 29.4 percent drop in sales year-on-year, the sector remained far larger than either music or video overall. Total spending on video games from January to June 2024 stood at £348.6m, compared to £213.7m for video and £163.8m for music.

			<p>A new Zelda: Ocarina Of Time mod promises to turn the classic entry in the series into the latest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, by introducing a new gameplay mechanic.</p>
<p>This new mod, which is being developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@notchase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notCHase</a> for the Ship of Harkinian open-source PC port, gives Link the power to fuse objects to weapons and shields similar to Tears of the Kingdom. While this ability definitely breaks the game, the possibilities it offers are very interesting to see. Sadly, the mod is not yet available for download, but hopefully, it won't take long for it to launch. In the meantime, you can check it out in the video below.</p>

<p>The Ship of Harkinian is one of the native Zelda: Ocarina of Time PC ports available for download. It offers additional features not found in the original, such as higher framerate support, a variety of visual and gameplay enhancements, including the higher-quality textures found on the Nintendo 3DS port, a built-in randomizer, and more. The same team that developed this port is also working on a native PC port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-majoras-mask-native-pc-port/">Majora's Mask.</a></p>
<p>You can download the Zelda: Ocarina Of Time Ship of Harkinian port and learn more about it on its <a href="https://www.shipofharkinian.com/">official website</a>.</p>

<p>Respawn recently unveiled a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new monetisation strategy</a> for Apex Legends, which essentially splits the Battle Pass into two separate passes and removes the use of AC or Apex Coins from the beginning of Season 22. This move has disappointed Apex Legends fans, as they have expressed their feelings by review-bombing the game on Steam. Learn more details below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-steam-reviews-battle-pass-controversy-1851595270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Apex Legends’ reviews on Steam have recently turned “Overwhelmingly Negative,” which shows players’ annoyance with this new strategy. Since the latest battle pass announcement, Apex Legends has gathered over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">10,000 negative reviews</a>, with most pointing fingers at the new battle pass system.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Players with over <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dualz313/recommended/1172470/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1,000 gameplay hours</a> have stated they are done with the game. Most players stated that even the “cheaters”, the “audio issues”, and other problems were bearable, but the new Battle Pass system is the end of the line for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the earlier system, players could purchase Battle Passes with AC coins, which players could earn back by progressing through the battle pass tiers during the season. They could be then used again to purchase the battle pass of the next season, making it a one-time purchase. With the new IRL currency strategy, players will have to shell out around $20 each season if they want to acquire all content from both battle passes, which isn’t ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we have seen the remarkable influence of the gaming community on games in recent times. The most recent instance was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/">Helldivers 2 review bombing fiasco</a>. Players were against a required PSN login to play the game, even on Steam. Their protest ended <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong-arming Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> into removing the need for PSN on Steam, a win for the gaming community. This shows the power of the community to influence change. Hopefully, the Apex Legends community can achieve a similar feat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other news, Apex Legends Champion <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-champion-apex-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ImperialHal stated</a>, “Apex is Dying”. This statement, coupled with the ongoing review bombing, raises concerns about the game’s future.

            <p>
A Microsoft team leader has emailed thousands of staff to protest the closure of a major internal group focused on promoting diversity, equity and inclusion within the company. 
</p>
<p>
The outgoing staff member blasted Microsoft's decision to cut their team amid a wider cooling in the corporate space to the need for diversity groups generally. 
</p>
<p>
A quote from the email first published by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-dei-leader-email-2024-7">Business Insider</a> claims that the team had been told it was "eliminated due to 'changing business needs'". 
</p>
<p>
In response, a Microsoft spokesperson told the publication in statement, also shared with Eurogamer, that its "D&amp;I commitments remain unchanged. Our focus on diversity and inclusion is unwavering and we are holding firm on our expectations, prioritising accountability, and continuing to focus on this work."

<p>
Microsoft has continually cut jobs over the past few years, and made more staff redundant on 1st July, per social media updates from those affected. Eurogamer contacted Microsoft for more detail on the numbers laid off at the time, but did not receive a response. 
</p>
<p>
"True systems-change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020," the laid-off team leader wrote in their email, highlighting a growing trend of cutting DEI-focused teams across the tech space. Google, Zoom and Facebook owner Meta have also laid off diversity-focused staff over the past year. 
</p>
<p>
In another section of their email, obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-dei-lead-blasts-company-in-internal-email-after-team-is-reportedly-laid-off">IGN</a>, the team leader discussed some of the wider context behind the deprioritisation of DEI programs. In a nutshell, they say that the push for greater inclusion efforts that brought investment is fading, while political winds are also on the change.
</p>
<p>
"Unofficially in my opinion, not specific to Microsoft alone, but [right-wing Republican policy plan should Trump be re-elected] Project 2025 looms and true systems change work associated with DEI programs everywhere are no longer business critical or smart as they were in 2020. Hence the purposeful and strategic three-to-five year shelf life of many company's inclusion commitments post the murder of George Floyd are being re-evaluated.
</p>
<p>
"And the way I see it, the timing was impeccable so businesses everywhere could re-evaluate the path forward should their US federal contracts be at risk if the work continues on its face."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Microsoft laid off 1900 people across Xbox and Activision Blizzard in January</a> this year, following earlier layoffs in 2023. Across the video games industry as a whole, more than 20,000 people are thought to have been let go over the past two years, with more let go in 2024 so far than the whole of last year.

			<p>Still Wakes the Deep Patch 1.3 has been deployed, finally adding support for DLSS, FSR3 and XeSS upscaling to the PC Game Pass version.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's survival horror title was released across PC and consoles last month. The game was also made available on Game Pass upon launch. <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-pc-once-again-lacks-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-at-still-wakes-the-deeps-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unfortunately, the Game Pass PC release once again lacked several features</a>, including support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR3, and Intel XeSS upscaling. As confirmed by the development team last month, a new update would add support for DLSS for the Game Pass version. In addition, the team said that it was investigating the possibility of AMD FSR3 support. "The Chinese Room and Secret Mode are hearing you and we'll be working to rectify this issue as our highest priority", the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1622910/discussions/0/4345491756988100844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> last month. "DLSS implementation is in progress, and will be rolled out in July as part of the patch above."</p>
<p>Fast forward one month, and we now have this promised patch. Not only does it add support for DLSS, but as mentioned, support for FSR3 and XeSS as well. In addition, for PC Game Pass, this new update adds additional resolution options when playing the game in windowed mode. Aside from the support for the different upscaling techniques and new resolution modes for the PC Game Pass version, this new update also packs various bug fixes as as well as some other new features. You can find the full release notes for this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1622910/view/6783067225509637923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch here</a>.</p>
<p>Still Wakes the Deep is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As said, the title is also available through Game Pass. Here's what we wrote about The Chinese Room's title in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>While Still Wakes the Deep offers up its fair share of thrills, railroad-style level design, a short runtime, and a surprisingly superficial story result in an experience that may entertain in the moment, but will likely be forgotten rather quickly. Still Wakes the Deep may well float your boat at a discount, but there are better, scarier fish in the sea.</em></p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a> - a vaguely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-y sub-hour dread droplet -  opens, you’re sitting on a bed across from a man wearing a mask that looks like someone gave up halfway through carving an Easter Island statue of Joe Camel, stuck a pair of googly eyes on it, then went to cry in the corner at what they’d created.</p>
<p>In your hand is a clicker counter. Moose-face stares. What do those eyes convey? Patience? Intent? Longing? If nothing else, they betray a deep certainty that whatever else happens, you’re going to click. If you stop clicking for a moment, a prompt appears in the corner telling you the controls. At least, I think it's a prompt, because it might actually be a threat.</p>
<p>Left click to click. He'd like you to click 1000 times, please.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>1000 clicks before I get a big wad of cash, I’m told. That’s why I’m here. Immediately, a burning mystery presents itself: Are you really going to make me click 1000 times, game? Or, more pertinently, am I really going to click hundreds of times just to find out?</p>

<p>At irregular intervals, the man will speak to you, and thus I predictably begin to form superstitious rituals around the clicker. What if I click it really fast? What if I get to this number? What if I don’t click it at all? I soon discover I can hold the space bar down to click and feel like a genius. I balance my speaker remote on my space bar and go do some crunches. I’m still watching the screen, of course. I’m not taking my eyes off this camel fucker.</p>
<p>He is deeply unnerving.  On his shirt is either blood or the delicious Korean fermented soy and chilli paste known as gochujang. And buddy, I do not think it is the delicious Korean fermented soy and chilli paste known as gochujang. I try watching the static on the tv for a while, but no. I feel his googly eyes burning into my back.</p>
<p>Some nice jazz occasionally swells up in the background, but I can’t really enjoy over the sound of the clicking. It would be presumptuous of me to suggest that my clicking, rhythmic and routine as it is, provides a complementary improvisation to such wonderful brass. Still, I choose to hear a certain freeform chaos between the clacks of plastic on plastic, scores of minor entropic armageddons, in the knowledge that any act of time wasting is also a very minor act of self destruction.</p>
<p>I’m sorry. I’ve just been clicking for so long.</p>
<p>I start timing the clicks. With the spacebar held down, it’s about ten every two generous seconds. That’s three hundred click per minute. That’s…uh. It’s a long time. It’s a long, long time to be clicking a clicker. I’m not going to stop of, course. I’m in too deep at this point.</p>
<p>The real gag at the heart of Clickolding, despite the pun name and the hints you’re indulging in your captor-client's kink, is that you're the mark here. It's a guiltily gratifying act of self-imposed BDSM, one humiliating click after the other. Then again, so is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>, and at least this has the decency to not threaten you with another season. You can grab Clickolding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/">on Steam</a> for £2.24/€2.69/$2.69. I’d give it a resounding thumbs up, but my hands need a rest.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service-soon.929328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blizzard-sends-1-month-pc-game-pass-trial-triggering-speculation-of-more-games-joining-the-service/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, Blizzard Entertainment began emailing its users one-month PC Game Pass trial codes (only usable on new accounts). I got one myself, and there are many other reports <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e5920i/blizzard_has_started_sending_out_pc_game_pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on places like Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the offer is that it is set to expire on July 24. You have a week to redeem your code. Why July 24, though? Well, recent rumors have suggested a new wave of Activision Blizzard games might be about to be added to the subscription service.</p>
<p>Chief among them is, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</a>. Call of Duty fans have been looking forward to the massive first-person shooter franchise being added to Game Pass, and the new Modern Warfare III season drops on July 24. Microsoft might be trying to get more new users in ahead of the game's arrival on the subscription service.</p>
<p>In addition to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> rumors that Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Spyro: Reignited Trilogy, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 will soon join Game Pass. However, these are all Activision titles and the promotion email came specifically from Blizzard. As such, it's not far-fetched to imagine some Blizzard games might be part of this new wave following <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lands-on-game-pass-on-march-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV's example</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Remasters like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-ii-resurrected-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo II: Resurrected</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warcraft-iii-reforged-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warcraft III: Reforged</a> come to mind, as well as classics like Starcraft and Diablo III, not to mention perks for Overwatch 2. Then there's the long-standing dream of World of Warcraft joining Game Pass, although that's hard to imagine coming to fruition, given that the monthly subscription price of Blizzard's MMORPG is higher than PC Game Pass ($14.99 versus $11.99). Perhaps they could offer a discount.</p>
<p>Adding a good chunk of the extraordinary Activision Blizzard portfolio would surely go a long way toward convincing consumers that Game Pass is still convenient even after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> latest price increase.</a> As a reminder, the Ultimate tier will cost $19.99, up from $16.99; the PC tier will be raised to $11.99 from $9.99, and the console tier will be unavailable to new users, replaced by a more limited Standard tier priced at $14.99.</p>
<p>According to analysts, Game Pass users should anticipate <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-users-should-expect-more-price-bumps-in-the-future-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even more hikes in the future</a>.</p>

With 4K resolution, 120fps support, and instant loading thanks to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">speedy SSD</a>, every game is a joy to play on Xbox Series X. Alongside the numerous features for home entertainment, the Series X can easily be the perfect home console for any gamer. It's a major upgrade over the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-s-review">Xbox Series S</a>, which is only capable of 1440p output on select titles. </p><p>Now's as good a chance as any to pick up a new Xbox with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-sales-and-deals">Amazon Prime Day</a> running through Wednesday night and other retailers with their own competing sales. As part of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-sale-prime-day-2024">Best Buy's Black Friday in July sale</a>, you can save $50 off a new Xbox Series X console. Not only that, but you will also get a free $50 Best Buy gift card with your purchase, which you can use to score a new game or controller. </p><h2>Xbox Series X + $50 Best Buy Gift Card for $449</h2><div id="204354" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>FREE $50 BEST BUY GIFT CARD WITH PURCHASE</p></div><p><h3>Microsoft - Xbox Series X 1TB Console - Black</h3></p></div>Immediately upon purchase, the gift card will be emailed to you alongside your receipt. Since Best Buy's sale is open to everyone, you won't need to be a My Best Buy member to score this gift card. <p>The Xbox Series X is a great console overall for any game you'd like to play. With Game Pass Ultimate – grab a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-43-off-for-prime-day-stock-up-now-and-avoid-the-price-hike">three-month subscription for 43% off for Prime Day</a> – you can even stream games over the cloud and pick up where you left off, even if you're not home.</p><h2>What We Said In Our Review</h2><p>Xbox Series X is an excellent console that offers the most power available in the console space currently. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-review">In our review</a>, we said the following about the Series X: "No matter what current games you throw at it, your loading times will be drastically cut, your framerates will be smoother, and your resolutions will be higher. This bold and minimalistically designed box is quiet, compact for both the power it packs and especially how it compares to the PS5, capable, and loaded with convenience features like instantly resuming and cycling between any of your recently played games."
</p><h3>Is It Worth Buying At This Price?</h3><p>If you are currently a Game Pass subscriber or plan to subscribe to the service, Xbox Series X is a great choice. You'll get hundreds of games instantly to play through, with the best performance available in the Xbox ecosystem. Plus, with the 4K Disc drive, you can play any <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-part-two-deal-prime-day-2024">4K Blu-rays</a> with ease.</p><p>However, if you're in no rush to purchase a new console, you'll likely find far better deals later in the year for Black Friday, especially as Xbox plans to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">three new console variants</a>. It's likely that the current Xbox Series X will be discounted alongside these releases to push more Xbox consoles into the market.</p><p>For more Xbox deals, be sure to check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals-prime-day-2024">best Xbox deals of Prime Day 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2024 1:39 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will launch first in Early Access for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520160/Chrono_Sword/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2024. <span id="more-899374"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via CFK:</p><blockquote><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> is a pixel art Souls-like action RPG developed by Korean dev team 21c.Ducks that tells the story of the dark gothic fantasy world of Adelnor, where players must travel between the past and future to unlock its secrets. Revealed first to the public in 2019, this Soulslike action RPG garnered a great deal of interest in Korea and abroad for its unique pixel graphics and gameplay. Selected as the first game in the collaboration campaign by North American crowdfunding site <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gameround/chrono-sword-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and the global game testing platform Game Round.Inc in 2020, it raised over seventy thousand dollars to successfully reach its funding goal.</p><p>Developer 21c.Ducks has submitted <em>Chrono Sword</em> to a number of game shows in Korea and abroad, where it was praised and awarded by a number of these for its gameplay. The developer then used this as a chance to refine the gameplay and level design within the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_899380"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Chrono Sword</em> isn’t another 3D rendered game like many of the Souls-like <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,243 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPGs</a> released these days, instead rendered in an isometric pixel art style for this unique Souls-like. Since 21c.Ducks announced the game, they’ve shown a heart and soul commitment to elevating the game’s storyline and the features that make it a Soulslike action RPG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Chrono Sword</em> spans a vast land splayed out in three dimensions, all rendered in its pixel art style. Once inside, players will embark on a “journey through time,” able to venture between the past, present, and future, switching between maps seamlessly with no loading screens.</p><p>In addition, the game features a variety of systems that incorporate the heavy enemy and player hits common to the Souls-like genre, but with the action made faster and more intense. Details of the enhancements made to <em>Chrono Sword</em> will be revealed at a later date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.
