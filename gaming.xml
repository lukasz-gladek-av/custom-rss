			<p>When you think of mobile games, it’s hard not to picture your grandma playing 500 levels of <em>Candy Crush </em>or a virtual gambling simulator disguised as a pretty anime character collector. There are plenty of gems that break outside of those molds, though, and developer KIWIWALKS has been pumping them out for nearly 10 years now in the form of the <em>WitchSpring </em>series. What started as a cute, character-driven RPG series that lived on your phone has recently grown into a proper console game franchise. <em>WitchSpring3 Re:Fine </em>saw releases on Steam and the Nintendo Switch, and just last year a full remake of the very first game in the series dropped on Steam. That remake, <em>WitchSpring R, </em>is finally coming to consoles, and now even more people have an opportunity to experience one of the most charming RPGs I’ve ever played.</p>
<p><iframe title="WitchSpring R - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAQHNXqfGmU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I hesitate to call <em>WitchSpring R </em>a JRPG, since it’s origins as a Korean-developed game leave it technically lacking in the J department. Despite that, though, the spirit and style of the game channels so much iconic JRPG energy. In particular, as a massive fan of the chill alchemy-focused <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/"><em>Atelier </em></a>series, I felt right at home diving into the adventures of bunny-eared witch Pieberry and her talking bird companion who goes by the unfortunate name of Black Joe.</p>


<p>Typically content with a life of solitude in her magic forest, Pieberry gains a newfound goal of discovery when she tastes her namesake for the first time – human-baked pie. So, on top of her usual routine of foraging for materials and fending off monsters and witch-hating humans, she sets out to explore the world beyond her home and see what other human inventions she can experience that are as good as pie.</p>
<p>I love a game with low-stakes, and <em>WitchSpring R </em>plays into that so perfectly. At first, the stakes are arguably a bit too low – it takes a while for the game’s writing to break out of the rhythm of just feeling like it’s dialogue purely for the purpose of gameplay tutorializing. That slow start eventually gives way to a rhythm and routine that helped the narrative really fall into place for me, though. Without an immediate end-of-the-world plot being thrust on me, the smaller encounters that make up most of <em>WitchSpring R’</em>s story helped give a lot more grounded charm to all the characters that got introduced along the way.</p>


<p>It helps that the gameplay in <em>WitchSpring R </em>is not only varied, but fun enough that it feels all to natural to fall into the gameplay loop routine of it all. Combat in the game isn’t triggered by any random encounters – you can see enemies on the field and choose when, or if, you want to engage them. It makes battles feel like a calculated choice alongside your routine of harvesting materials, or doing minigames to raise Pieberry’s various stats in the Growth menu. Battles are pretty simple turn-based encounters, with Pieberry being able to dish out standard attacks or various Magical Slab abilities while Black Joe can hop in to provide items and potions in a pinch.</p>
<p>As you progress through the game you’ll recruit characters who can expand your party, but you also get to capture a huge variety of monsters and make them part of your party, too. In a standard playthrough, the combat in <em>WitchSpring R </em>will be more about party customization and stat growth than dense strategy – but new game+, higher difficulty options, and bonus bosses give you lots of opportunities to push your battle prowess to the limits if you so choose.</p>

<p>The 30 or so hour runtime of <em>WitchSpring R </em>flew by in a flash for me. It’s a gorgeous game full of beautiful character art, whimsical music, and a lighthearted story that dishes out all my favorite, comfortable JRPG tropes. If you’re looking for a high-stakes adventure with grim narrative consequences, this won’t pass the sniff test for you. But if you’re in the market for a comfortable, cute RPG experience, <em>WitchSpring R </em>is a must-play.</p>

			<p>As promised on the roadmap to launch, BioWare has just <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/combat-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a new blog post that included a series of attached gameplay videos showing off the combat system of Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>The footage is grabbed from the point of view of a Warrior player character who chose the Champion specialization, which is designed around defense and fire damage (which is great against Darkspawn, who are vulnerable to fire). As previously outlined by the studio, players will have to pick three abilities plus an Ultimate attack, the latter of which depends on the class specialization, to bring into battle. In this case, the player chose Driving Kick, Grappling Spear, Spectral Bulwark, and Warden's Fire.</p>
<p>We also get a first look at Runes, which complement active abilities. The three Runes picked in this case were Mend, which consumes all Rage to heal Rook when activated; Crystallize, which freezes all enemies in a radius of 10 meters around the player character; and Diminish, which weakens all enemies within 6 meters. Another Rune highlighted in the video is Scorch, which changes all weapon attacks to deal Fire damage for 20 seconds. Overall, Runes provide additional control, utility, and damage boost.</p>
<p>This Rook also uses full Heavy Armor, which gives them access to the related Mastery that boosts defense by 20% and reduces the chance of being disrupted upon receiving a hit. Another major passive in the skill tree is Fiery Resolve, granting Flaming Weapons upon successfully parrying an attack. The video then switches to the equipment section, showing gear that improves Stagger, leading to easier takedowns. The Stagger meter is shown as a lavender bar, whereas the Armor Barrier is a yellow bar, and it is reduced most easily with heavy melee attacks. On the other hand, ranged attacks remove the Shield Barrier (colored in blue).</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | High-Level Combat Parts 1-4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O2UEqn38s9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be played best when synergizing strategies with Rook's companions. For example, in the mission shown in the video, Lucanis' Adrenaline Rush boosts Rook's damage, whereas Davrin's Heroic Strike applies the Overwhelmed debuff, increasing the Stagger taken by the target. Companions can also help with crowd control, as shown with Lucanis' Abominate, an ability that knocks down foes in the target area. Arguably, their greater use is with combos, though. After asking Davrin to taunt nearby foes and pulling a far one with Grappling Spear, Rook enables the Crystallize rune to freeze them, opening them up for Lucanis' Eviscerate combo detonation.</p>
<p>All this rests on top of the combat basics: jump, light attack, heavy attack, and dodge, the latter of which is available even in the middle of an attack. Both light attacks and heavy attacks can be charged down to hit enemies harder, and some attacks are triggered contextually upon jumping or sprinting at an enemy. Each class has ranged attacks (the Warrior Champion has shield throw, Captain America style), blocks and/or parries, and two distinct weapon sets to swap during fights.</p>

On another note, at Gamescom, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ray-tracing-will-also-be-available-on-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> confirmation that ray tracing would be available on consoles, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Preview: Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-purest-evolution-of-a-stellar-rpg.963141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2014, Warhorse Studios published a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of Kingdom Come Deliverance. In a few months, the campaign had been completed more than three times over, and in 2018, one of the most realistic open-world RPG titles emerged to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>Now, the team is shaping up to release Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a direct continuation of the first game and an evolution in every sense of the word. I recently got hands-on with KCD2 at Gamescom, enjoying a solid chunk of the game reserved exclusively for press participants.</p>



<p>This is my preview – enjoy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-flawless-execution">Flawless Execution</h2>



<p>To give a little context, my preview of KCD2 was set ‘around 50 hours’ into the game, with a strong and determined Henry of Skalitz facing down a local swordmaster and then taking part in a few events that unravelled after that duel took place. I had an opportunity to explore Kuttenberg, one of two super-sized cities in KCDII, and try out many of the game’s core mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Stealth</li>



<li>Open Combat</li>



<li>Lockpicking</li>



<li>Dialogue</li>



<li>Tournaments</li>



<li>Bartering</li>
</ul>



<p>I’ve logged a couple of hundred hours in Kingdom Come Deliverance and would consider myself a huge fan. It was just a few weeks ago that I had the opportunity to interview Tom McKay, who plays Henry of Skalitz, the series’ protagonist.</p>



<p>When I stepped into KCDII, I was blown away to learn how much of an improvement it was over the first game. The team at Warhorse Studios has managed to do something remarkable, as KCDII has evolved immeasurably but retained the core concept and feel of the first game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VP6bjlger8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Graphically, KCDII is nothing short of sublime. From the character models to the base animations, and from the lighting to the depth and density of the environments the player can explore, everything is top-notch. It’s unmistakably a Kingdom Come game, but it has been taken to the next level by the team at Warhorse and it’s a pleasure to behold.</p>



<p>I explored the game beyond the demo, taking the time to study the menus and the UI, and I ultimately failed to find a flaw with anything. It has all been fully refreshed for this second outing, and everything just <strong>worked</strong>. The menus are intuitive, the UI has been made more accessible, and everything from crafting to levelling up is easy to understand and makes sense.</p>



<p>Even the smaller details have been improved upon. For instance, in KCD (2018), opening doors often resulted in a fumbling hand reaching for a handle, but I noticed that in KCDII, Henry firmly grasped door handles. If you’re not enthused by studying the smaller details in an open-world RPG title, you won’t understand why elements like this are so exciting.</p>



<h2 id="h-bigger-better-bolder">Bigger, Better, Bolder</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 promises to be a monumental sequel. The story leads on directly from the first game, so it’ll undoubtedly help if you can take a walk through the 2018 title and get up to speed. Warhorse has doubled the size of the world, but it hasn’t lost that sense of identity. It’s expansive, but it’s also packed with things to see and do.</p>



<p>It’s also fully open-ended. The skill system in-game means that you’re able to create your own Henry of Skalitz, and you’re free to use the weapons, armour, and abilities that you see fit. It’s also rooted in realism once again, so everything from the combat mechanics to the way people behave is period-accurate.</p>



<p>I went from playing KCD to exploring KCDII in the space of a week, which I think was the best way to approach it. The difference between the two games is staggering, and as I soaked up the KCDII, I had my hair blown back. It’s smooth, it’s entertaining, and everyone at Warhorse Studios should be proud of the product they’ve put together.</p>



<p>I can see KCDII becoming my Game of the Year in 2025 – but it does have some <strong>strong </strong>competition.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released on February 11, 2025, on PS5, XSX, and PC.</p>

<p>The Esports Awards 2024 ceremony has just wrapped up and every trophy has been handed out. This iconic event took place in Saudi Arabia to coincide with the Esports World Cup, which will end in a couple of days following two months of intense competitive action. In this breakdown, we’re going to outline every winner at the Esports Awards 2024 showcase. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-awards-winners">All Esports Awards Winners</h2>



<p>In the run-up to the Esports Awards, controversy surfaced as some ruling panellists dropped out of the event. This was mostly attributed to the setting of the Esports Awards, with some claiming that the organisers had just ‘accepted a bag’ to assist with the ‘esportswashing’ of Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>Despite that, the Esports Awards 2024 ceremony played out positively, and some very deserving folks won their respective trophies. Unfortunately, it looked as though viewership took a hit this year, with Esports Charts reporting fewer hours watched and a lower peak concurrent viewership than the 2023 ceremony.</p>



<p>Here’s every winner from the Esports Awards:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Streamer of the Year: </strong>Samantha ‘Rivers’ Rivera Trevino</li>



<li><strong>Esports Personality of the Year: </strong>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner</li>



<li><strong>Esports Content Group of the Year: </strong>S8UL Esports</li>



<li><strong>Esports Game of the Year: </strong>VALORANT</li>



<li><strong>Mobile Esports Game of the Year: </strong>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</li>



<li><strong>Esports Coverage Platform of the Year: </strong>Liquipedia</li>



<li><strong>Esports Publisher of the Year: </strong>Riot Games</li>



<li><strong>Esports Commercial Partner of the Year: </strong>Red Bull</li>



<li><strong>Esports Creative Team of the Year: </strong>Team Liquid</li>



<li><strong>Esports Content of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>League of Legends – GODS ft. NewJeans</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Player of the Year:</strong> Stanislav ‘Malr1ne’ Potorak</li>



<li><strong>Breakthrough Game of the Year: </strong>Teamfight Tactics</li>



<li><strong>Esports Analyst of the Year: </strong>Jacob ‘Pimp’ Winneche</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of the core trophy list, <strong>Jens Hilgers </strong>picked up the Lifetime Achievement Award for many years of work and dedication to the industry. </p>



<p>Do you think these winners are deserving of their trophies?</p>

            <p>Stranger Video is a website that wants access to your webcam. Grant it and it will show you a close-up of your own face, the background around you cropped out. Close your eyes to tell it you're ready, and open them again when you hear a chime. It'll now connect you to a stranger doing the same thing: first person to blink loses.
</p>
<p>You <a href="https://stranger.video/">can play it here</a>.

<p>I'm playing it <em>right now</em> and no one else in the world is. Let's all of us play it together.
</p>
<p>Stranger Video is work of Eieio, who makes "stuff for the 2000s internet." It has that old school, lofi, '00s vibe, as if a leftover from the personal web. It's also from the same creator as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-called-one-million-checkboxes-has-sparked-a-terrible-online-war">One Million Checkboxes, which Edwin wrote about back in June</a>. 
</p>
<p>Both of these are nominees in <a href="https://tinyawards.net/">the Tiny Awards</a>, which aims to celebrate "the other web, the one that is small and handmade and isn’t trying to sell you anything or monetise anything but which instead is about people using the digital tools we all have access to to make the sorts of small, personal experiences that you tend not to see ‘in feed’." It's a trove of beautiful websites.</p>
<p>Anyway. Put your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/staring-eyes">staring eyes</a> where your mouth is, RPS readers.

            <p>Valve have their own rating system for measuring how games run on Steam Deck, but even following the guidance of whether something is "Playable" or "Verified", I've still run into games that simply do not work on the handheld device.
</p>
<p>Enter Steam reviews. Reviews from players who primarily played on Steam Deck will now have a little Deck icon, which when moused over tells you the exact amount of time spent on the Deck.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Steam users can also filter in search of these reviews by clicking the 'Playtime' dropdown at the top of the reviews section and selecting "Played mostly on Steam Deck."
</p>
<p>This is a relatively minor change, but ooh it's a useful one. I play a lot of games on Steam given my career, such as it is, and it makes a big difference knowing upfront whether something is going to work comfortably on the Deck or whether I need to continue hunching over my desktop for 60+ hours every week.
</p>
<p>Valve have made a handful of tweaks to Steam user reviews of late. Earlier this month they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-latest-update-to-user-reviews-doesnt-find-your-jokes-memes-ascii-art-and-other-content-as-funny-as-you-do">moved to de-prioritise user reviews that were extremely short or which contained ASCII art</a>, because although these reviews may be funny (or "funny"), they're not helpful to those making purchasing decisions. 
</p>
<p>You could always skip the user reviews and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">read ours</a>, mind. We sometimes review games on Steam Deck and always note when we do (recently, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crimson-diamond-review">The Crimson Diamond</a>), and James is forever testing games on the device for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-academy">Steam Deck Academy</a>.

            <p>Tens of thousands of people have been playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, a new multiplayer shooter from Valve, for the past several months, but in that time there's been no official announcement or acknowledgement of the game's existence by its creators. Until now. Valve have posted an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">extremely barebones Steam store page for Deadlock</a>, describing it as a "multiplayer game in early development."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Deadlock is still in early development stages with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay," says the page. "Access to Deadlock is currently limited to friend invites via our playtesters." The page a lso contains a single 22 second teaser trailer and no screenshots.
</p>
<p>Deadlock is being <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">played by 63,000 people at the time of writing</a>, however. Previously those with access to the beta were asked "not share anything about the game with anyone," although inevitably footage did leak out into the wider web. That restriction has now been fully lifted, with people posting thoughts and more videos across the internet.
</p>
<p>It sounds as if Deadlock is a mixture of Dota and Super Monday Night Combat; a third-person, 6v6 multiplayer shooter with lanes, respawning creeps, and a skyrail transit system.
</p>
<p>I've seen it argued that it's bizarre for Valve not to announce a game so many people are clearly playing, but frankly I can understand the decision. Valve are known for cancelling projects during development, and as a genre, a lot of multiplayer shooters seem to stumble during their beta phase. How many games have Ubisoft announced in the last five years, for example, only to cancel the moment players touched themn? My only disappointment is that Valve didn't find a more interesting name than "Deadlock" before making it official.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024.963009/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The existence of the PS5 Pro was long discussed throughout 2024 thanks to various leaks and rumors, but the latest State of Play that aired in late May didn't feature any announcement for the new hardware. With Summer drawing to a close soon, some fans wondered whether the more powerful PlayStation 5 iteration had been delayed. However, at the Gamescom 2024 that's being held this week in Cologne, developers started talking.</p>
<p>In a recent live stream, the Italian website Multiplayer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ezm1pu/italian_journalist_seems_to_confirm_the_imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that it had heard from a developer that they had delayed their game due to the upcoming launch of the PS5 Pro. I can confirm that I heard something similar during one of my appointments at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Without even being prodded by me at all, a developer that I won't name openly said they had received the specs of the PS5 Pro and were confident that Unreal Engine 5 would run much better on the new hardware compared to the regular PlayStation 5. Considering the circumstances revealed by Multiplayer, I'm positive this is not the same developer they talked to. Moreover, the studio I heard it from is not at all a big one, which makes it clear the hardware's specifications and details are already in the hands of a large number of game makers.</p>
<p>As such, it is reasonable to assume an official announcement is near. Looking at the PS4 Pro, the console was announced on September 7, 2016, and subsequently launched on November 10. The same could happen again, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/september-playstation-showcase-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> by an industry analyst in late July.</p>
<p>While we wait for Sony to announce what the whole industry seems to know at this point, let's recap the more credible leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>45% performance improvement in rasterized rendering thanks to a larger GPU and faster memory</li>
<li>Hugely improved ray tracing architecture delivering 2-3x speedup on average, with peaks of 4x</li>
<li>Custom machine learning architecture that supports 300 TOPS at 8-bit to power the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling technique, Sony's version of Multi Frame Super Resolution based on the PlayStation Machine Learning (PSML) algorithm.</li>
<li>PSSR is an ML-enhanced version of Temporal Anti-Aliasing Upscaling (TAAU) that requires inputs similar to NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR and fully supports High Dynamic Range (HDR) pipelines. It also does not require per-game training like the latest version of DLSS.</li>
</ul>

Most of what we’ve seen of the RPG thus far has been in the early game, so we still didn’t have a strong grasp of what high-level encounters look like. There have been a lot of questions surrounding the sequel, as we’d been hearing the studio talk a fair bit about how some long-held mechanics for the series, such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">controlling your party members</a></span> and having access to all your abilities, wouldn’t be returning in <em>The Veilguard</em>. So now’s the time to see what those things were replaced with in this more action-focused RPG. If you don’t have time to watch the full breakdown, here are some of the big takeaways.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-recommend-id="image://6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-recommend-id="image://6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s systems seem to draw heavily from <em>Mass Effect</em>, and that includes a spin on <em>Andromeda</em>’s ability loadouts. Since you can’t access all your abilities on a wheel like you used to, <em>The Veilguard</em> has you decide on what attacks you’ll have at your disposal on a given quest and assign them. The showcase had a warrior version of protagonist Rook kitted out with a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Prc1UfuokY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Prc1UfuokY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Sparta”</a></span>-style kick, a grappling spear used to draw enemies in close, and a shield-like aura to protect her from damage. They definitely seem to be going for a tanky, brawler build, and picking the abilities best for whatever approach you’re going for will be key to defining your playstyle.<br></p><p>Also in the loadout is an Ultimate ability called Warden’s Fire, which rains down an area-of-effect attack on enemies. It sounds like this might be exclusive to Grey Warden Rooks, one of the origins you can select for your hero&nbsp;in the character creator at the beginning of the game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-recommend-id="image://bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-recommend-id="image://bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Runes are used to augment equipment in the <em>Dragon Age </em>games, and they’ll be making their return in <em>The Veilguard</em>.

Initially, I wondered if this might be exclusive to the Rogue class, as the dual-dagger playstyle is meant to be nimble and quick on their feet.

The example shown in the trailer is using a Crystallize rune to encase a group of enemies in ice, then having Lucanis follow it up with an area-of-effect ability called Eviscerate. The Ability Wheel highlights this as well, so it won’t always be a matter of trial and error to see if attacks can work together.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8d64d886f64b717968bcdad0c51d5d08" data-recommend-id="image://8d64d886f64b717968bcdad0c51d5d08" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook assesses the battlefield with the wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook assesses the battlefield with the wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d64d886f64b717968bcdad0c51d5d08" data-recommend-id="image://8d64d886f64b717968bcdad0c51d5d08" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook assesses the battlefield with the wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We can see Rook pinging between enemies while pausing the action from the Ability Wheel screen, so it looks like it might not be possible for enemies to hide from you thanks to awkward positioning or the like.

<p>Stalker 2 was recently delayed by GSC Game World and pushed back to November, which left some players stewing in dismay. It’s not the first time the game has been delayed, but hopefully, it’ll be the last. At Gamescom, the Stalker 2 team hosted a live, hands-on demo of the game, inviting players to enjoy 20 minutes of the intense survival shooter.</p>



<p>During the event in Cologne, the team from GSC Game World opened up about the expansiveness of the game, stressing that it’ll take 100 hours to fully complete Stalker 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-by-hand">All By Hand</h2>



<p>Speaking to GamesRadar, GSC’s Yevnhenii Kulyk explained that Stalker 2 is ‘huge’ and that it’ll take the average player around 100 hours to rinse it. As he broke down the depth of Stalker 2, he mentioned that the team used almost no procedural generation to create the massive in-game map, which incorporates areas in and around Chornobyl and Pripyat known as ‘The Zone’.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/stalker-2-dev-says-the-game-is-huge-takes-100-hours-to-fully-beat-and-was-built-entirely-by-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, it was stressed that ‘everything you see in the game was actually touched by a human hand.’</p>



<p>Kulyk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everything you may notice or experience in our game was made by the hands of our talented level designers, level artists, team designers, and so on. You will not notice two exact buildings or two exact rooms with the same placement of the same props of meshes or something like that. Every player that is playing Stalker 2 will get their story.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stalker 2 is one of this year’s most highly anticipated releases. I got hands-on with the game at Gamescom and was blown away by the depth of it. It’s a harrowing experience for players expecting an easy ride, and the world-building is nothing short of stunning. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/soneium-blockchain-sony-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-has-launched-%E2%80%98soneium%E2%80%99-blockchain-to-get-closer-to-web3-devs.962958/</guid>

<p>Sony has just revealed the development of Soneium, an all-new blockchain that aims to create ‘a world where Web3 use cases are a part of daily life.’ It’s not yet open to the public, but the plan is to flesh out an ecosystem that’ll one day facilitate Web3 game creation, interactions with NFT marketplaces, and ‘entertainment-related services’.</p>



<p>The tech titan said an extensive array of tools and environments will be provided to developers leaning on Soneium. They’ll be accessible, cost-effective, and user-friendly, and soon, a test environment will be set up for those eager to piece together applications that rely on the Soneium blockchain.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-very-significant-developments">‘Very Significant’ Developments</h2>



<p>In a statement, Sony’s Jun Watanabe spoke positively about the future of Web3 on Soneium, despite many naysayers claiming the company is getting involved far too late to gain traction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p id="anchor2-2">I think the development of a comprehensive Web3 solution based on blockchain is very significant to the Sony Group, which has developed a wide variety of businesses under its purpose of “Fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.” We will work to create diverse businesses and new use cases with the aim of delivering customer value that can only be enjoyed through Web3 technology to as many users as possible and making people’s lives richer and more colorful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of August, Sony will take to the stage at WebX in Tokyo, presenting further information about Soneium, an innovation from Sony Block Solutions Labs.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202408/24-029E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release published by Sony</a> explained that other businesses within the Sony Group will be explored for ways to link them to the Soneium platform. It wasn’t explicitly mentioned, but it’s assumed that this would include PlayStation. </p>



<p>It came down to dollars and cents towards the end of the press release, with Sony addressing the ‘new value’ streams that Soneium will open up, particularly in the <em>crypto asset trading </em>space. </p>



<p>Do you think Sony is a little late to the party with this?</p>

<p>The documentary takes you "from Vault to Wasteland" with the cast and crew of the Emmy-nominated series.

<p>Fallout hails from executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of Westworld. It stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, and Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Described as a story of "haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have", the show is set "200 years after the apocalypse, [when] the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them".</p>
<p>Fresh from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominations for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV show is in production and "ahead of schedule".</p>
<p>In related news, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game of all time on GOG</a>.</p>
<p>The fan-made mod - which is being distributed for free via GOG's platform, hence why the digital games distributor can't use terms like "fastest-selling" - was redeemed more than 500,000 times in its first 24 hours.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The channel will kick off its availability in the US, with Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand to follow, <a href="https://www.wildbrain.com/trade-news/wildbrain-selected-by-the-pok%C3%A9mon-company-international-as-the-official-partner-to-launch-the-belove">according to WildBrain’s announcement</a> this week.</p><p>Melissa Pearce, senior director of media licensing at The Pokémon Company International, called FAST TV is “an ideal platform” to connect with audiences and offer “accessible and curated content in a family-friendly environment.” </p><p>WildBrain distributes other ad-supported channels that include properties like <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>, and <em>Inspector Gadget</em>, and its channels exist on platforms like Tubi and Pluto.

At the moment, the distributor hasn’t said when the <em>Pokémon </em>channel will debut. Until then, The Pokemon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies">has a list</a> of other places you can watch its shows.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This includes assigning abilities, as you’ll have to make a loadout of select attacks similar to <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> rather than having a huge wheel to choose from in the previous games, navigating the skill tree and specializations, and choosing equipment that will be effective against enemies you know you’ll be facing on a certain quest. The showcase also shows the party selection screen—which features my husbands <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">Davrin and Lucanis</a></span>—so you can see how party members interact on the battlefield as well.</p><p>The encounter shown in the trailer includes fighting Darkspawn enemies, which are used to showcase enemy elemental weaknesses. With the Warrior class, you’ll be able to empower your weapons with elemental affinities such as a passive fire property, meaning you won’t be without options for elemental damage if there’s no mage in your party. The video also shows off companion commands, party synergy, and some stats and debuffs to be mindful of. The trailer wraps things up showing off primers and detonators, which, again, feels very <em>Mass Effect</em>-y in terms of one character setting up enemies with a status effect and another following it up for explosive damage. On top of having two companions you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">only control through commands</a></span>, it definitely feels like a lot of the design philosophies of the science fiction series have made their way to <em>Dragon Age</em>.</p><p>Overall, despite the action-heavy leanings, <em>The Veilguard</em> does seem to have a fair bit going on under the hood. Whether that’s enough for folks who miss the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955">tactical nature of <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em></a></span> remains to be seen, but it still looks like it has a lot of systems happening in real-time.
