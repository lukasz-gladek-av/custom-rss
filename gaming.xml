<figure><a title="MvC: Fighting Collection" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/943fe902c6a0b/mvc-fighting-collection.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a> has sold a total of 1 million copies since its launch in September 2024 (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collections-impressive-sales-show-fans-are-hungry-for-more">Push Square</a>).</p>
<p>Announced via social media, the translated post reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection global sales surpass 1 million copies!</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you, we have achieved global sales of 1 million copies!</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued support for this title!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's an impressive result for Capcom, but it seems almost guaranteed that we won't get a brand new entry in the series – at least not any time soon.</p>
<p>The reason for this, of course, is that Marvel is now collaborating with Sony on the new PS5 / PC title <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a>, with acclaimed developer Arc System Works (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>) at the helm.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6ePAJ6dxYWY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ePAJ6dxYWY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed49fea9qnxvgw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ePAJ6dxYWY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's not out of the question that we might see a new MvC in the future, but with Marvel Tōkon launching in 2026, we reckon Capcom might be more inclined to create a new entry in the Capcom vs. SNK series.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/capcom_vs_snk_2_mark_of_the_millennium_2001">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a> director Hideaki Itsuno recently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/capcom-vs-snk-2-director-really-wants-to-make-a-third-entry">stated his desire to make a third game</a>, and said he would do so if Capcom and SNK licensed it to his new studio, Lightspeed Japan Studio.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update-adds-new-dualsense-pairing-option-power-saver-mode.1299312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> system software update is set to go live in a few hours, introducing features that beta testers have been able to try out for a few months.</p>



<p>As confirmed today, the next big system software update will roll out tomorrow, September 17. Once the update is live, the system will download it automatically. If not, the download and installation process can be started manually by going into the Settings menu, then picking System, System Software, System Software Update, and Settings.</p>



<p>The biggest additions of the upcoming new PlayStation 5 system software update are Power Saver mode and a new DualSense pairing option that allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices. Power Saver mode, which can be enabled via the Settings, System, Power Saving, and Use Power Saver menu options, will be further supported down the line with updates to already available games such as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and Demon's Souls, while the soon-to-be-released Ghost of Yotei will support it at launch. This rather interesting reveal seems to support the idea that this new <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">Power Saver profile is targeting the specifications of the rumored PlayStation handheld system</a> that is supposedly releasing alongside the PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>While Power Saver mode is an option that few are likely to use for the time being, the new PlayStation 5 system software update's <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-beta-program-ps5-pro-dualsense-pairing-update/">DualSense pairing option</a> is surely going to see wider usage, especially for those who use the controller on PC. Once the update is live, it will be possible to register up to four devices simultaneously and switch between them directly from the controller.</p>



<p>More information on the next PlayStation 5 system software update rolling out tomorrow can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">Official PlayStation Blog.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Release Date Puts the Car in Carnage Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckreation-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckreation-release-date-puts-the-car-in-carnage-next-month.1299309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Three Fields Entertainment have announced the release date for vehicular destruction sandbox&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>, and it's causing some serious car-nage next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will land on PC and current-gen consoles (but no Nintendo Switch 2, unfortunately) on October 28th. It'll let you - and, optionally, your friends - loose in MixWorld, a "400 square kilometer racing realm that is yours to create, shape - and wreck".</p>

<p>As the title suggests,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is built mainly around its core arcade racing loop, which combines high-speed racing and driving with&nbsp;<em>Burnout</em>-style crashes and stunts. If you're still waiting for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wreckfest-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Wreckfest 2&nbsp;</em>to come out of Early Access</a>, this one should do more than just tide you over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=izuzCDGo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wreckreation-release-date-loops.jpg?itok=1HDUGAN1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>brings vehicular chaos in October.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's main attraction, however, is the aforementioned MixWorld, where you can place whatever crazy loops, ramps, and pipes your brain can conjure, before tasking your friends to take on your impossible gauntlet.</p>

<p>As THQ Nordic and Three Fields say,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation</em>'s MixWorld will offer you the chance to "build roads on and off-road", as well as "out to sea or up in the sky", so if you love to spend hours with&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;players' racing creations,&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is for you.</p>

<p>You can also customize your vehicle, as well as the gameplay challenges you're asking players to complete. Even time of day, weather conditions, and whether there's any traffic on the road can be customized and controlled.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>will play like (as well as seeing some pretty gnarly crashes), then you can check out the game's release date announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p><em>Wreckreation&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594040/Wreckreation/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005975/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wreckreation/9n0llb6pg0r4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 28th. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things THQ Nordic-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><span>unveiled the five </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration skins</span></a><span> it’s bringing to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> yesterday, and as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans tend to do, they had a pretty wide spread of reactions. When you have 44 heroes, it’s impossible to spread love across them equally, and it can get pretty irritating if your favorite never seems to get any love in the form of skins and other cosmetics. It’s especially grating when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>seems to favor a specific handful of characters with each event or collaboration. While support hero Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>the face of this issue</span></a><span>, wasn’t included in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>skins, the collaboration still hasn’t gone over well with some fans who feel that heroes like Genji and Mercy are getting preferential treatment, or are disappointed that some seemingly obvious crossovers didn’t manifest.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">drew junkrat skull and dva oracle earlier cause I'm hyped for the collab hehe ⚡<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OverwatchFanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OverwatchFanart</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Persona5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Persona5</a>​ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/6XOAOfgPgl">pic.twitter.com/6XOAOfgPgl</a></p> <p>— Souda (@lemonsoudaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonsoudaa/status/1967625308129112547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Surprisingly, the most contentious skin in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>event seems to be Genji as Ryuji. Genji makes a lot of sense for the collaboration, given that he’s one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s Japanese heroes, and his katana would make him a pretty natural fit for someone like Yusuke, who also uses a sword in the RPGs. Ryuji, however, is a bit of an odd pick. The track star is the tank of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s team, and uses blunt melee weapons in fights, such as bats and pipes. When Genji wears the skin based on the Phantom Thief, his katana is replaced by Ryuji’s base lead pipe, which, yeah, I mean, that’s a melee weapon, I guess, but you don’t slash people with a pipe the same way Genji does when he uses his katana in his ultimate attack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The choice is even more questionable considering that some fans feel Junkrat, the grenade-launching DPS hero and often forgotten member of the original roster, would have made a better fit, and had been speculating and hoping that he would get the Ryuji treatment. He has Ryuji’s blonde hair, the two have both suffered leg injuries that leave them with a distinct limp, and Ryuji is often a goofy comic relief character whose mannerisms would have worked well in a Junkrat highlight intro.</span></p>

D.Va, the mech-piloting tank, got a skin based on the student council president Makoto. It has some cool details, like her mech being based on Johanna, Makoto’s motorcycle-shaped Persona, but </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>also has a character who would have fit D.Va’s gamer theme: Futaba. The support character in </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>is a bit of a recluse. She’s extremely online and has to be dragged out of her bedroom to be social half the time, but she is always dropping gamer jokes and memes into casual conversation. D.Va pilots a mech because she was a pro gamer who uses her transferable skills to defend South Korea, so the comparisons are pretty apparent, especially because Futaba also pilots her own Persona like a mech. Still, some fans argue that adapting Johanna’s design for D.Va’s mech was an interesting creative choice.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah makoto! you remember the character in persona 5 who spoke in gamer lingo and spent most of her time in mementos in a mech like persona and had  heavy ties to technology in most of the phantom thieves? right? <a href="https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF">https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF</a></p> <p>— * (@star_piIot) <a href="https://twitter.com/star_piIot/status/1967634520720675158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">blizzard if they used more than 5 percent of their brain  and actually played persona 5 <a href="https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL">https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL</a> <a href="https://t.co/2OJdKvSzKy">pic.twitter.com/2OJdKvSzKy</a></p> <p>— Jonathan (@JonathanFess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanFess/status/1967756280862499250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is a good choice when you look at the mecha</p> <p>yall just dont have imagination <a href="https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz">https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz</a></p> <p>— AUZZIE ✈️ NYCC (@auzziejlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/auzziejlee/status/1967638175226138773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The blizzard dev scrolling past your post <a href="https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK">https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK</a> <a href="https://t.co/kzjiCO716i">pic.twitter.com/kzjiCO716i</a></p> <p>— Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1967745502306586881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If you go looking, you’ll find a lot of ideas fans had for the collaboration before Blizzard revealed the skins.

Ultimately, when Blizzard teases something weeks before revealing it, fans just have more time to imagine the perfect collaboration in their heads and be disappointed in whatever follows, and that disappointment is only exacerbated when there are already perceptions of favoritism. R.I.P. Ryuji Junkrat, though. A real missed opportunity, that one.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the charms of the Warring States Soulslike series Nioh is its plethora of playstyles. So far in the series, we've seen weapons including swords that ooze Samurai Style, ninja-like sickle and chains, and even unusual choices like tonfa. Each weapon also has high, medium and low stances that players switch between in order to best face an enemy, all working together to create the sort of action that the series is known for. Add a variety of skills on top and you get a wide range of RPG builds that act as one of the draws for the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nioh 3, the long-awaited return to the series, features a more advanced combat system composed of Samurai Style, whose combat is similar to what we expect from a Nioh game, as well as Ninja Style, which lets players fight with swift movements. Players can switch between the two with a single button, and doing so causes your weapons, armor and even usable skills to change, giving you the feeling of using two builds at the same time. It quite literally doubles the game's charm as both an action title and an RPG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more. During character creation, you create looks for both Samurai and Ninja Styles.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ninja Style even changes how your character looks as you ninja run and more.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While we've fought as a samurai until now in the Nioh series, it has been possible to use a ninja-like combat style. So why fully split gameplay into these two styles in the newest title? When we ask Nioh 3 General Producer Fumihiko Yasuda about why they added Ninja Style, he explains, "We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continues, "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer. That's why we've added this style."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a kind of new action meant to feel like a step forward, Ninja Style really does play and look quite different from Samurai Style. Samurai Style consists of the kind of steady, block-focused combat we've come to expect from the Nioh series. When in it, you can change between weapon stances as you always have, and you can use Ki Pulse after attacking, a stamina recovery technique the series is known for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pressing a button after attacking while in Ninja Style will allow you to use Mist, creating a clone as you move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, Ninja Style involves quick, evasion-focused combat. Weapon stances don't exist in this style, but ninjutsu are available to use in their place. Ki Pulse also becomes replaced with a new action, Mist.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mist creates a clone after attacking as you move quickly, allowing you to get behind an enemy (where your attacks deal more damage). Though this Mist action does allow for a swift and stylish form of combat, some people do seem disappointed that it takes away their ability to use Ki Pulse as they always could. Using it becomes second nature to an experienced Nioh player, likely in part because it also links to dispelling special zones created by enemies known as yokai realms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why make it so that Ki Pulse is only available in Samurai Style? According to producer Kohei Shibata, this was done to clearly distinguish between the feeling of being a samurai versus a ninja through these styles. Ki Pulse is known as Zanshin in Japanese, a term related to kendo and swordsmanship that refers to a state of mind that prevents one from being open to an attack after striking. Shibata says that the way this manifests in-game, where you carefully manage your ki as you fight, is its way of incorporating a samurai's style of fighting that draws on both stillness and motion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A black aura will sometimes appear on the ground while fighting an enemy. This is a yokai realm, an area that will reduce your Ki recovery speed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Giving Ninja Style Ki Pulse as well resulted in an issue where the tempo of its combat resembled Samurai Style,” says Shibata. “For ninja, we wanted players to use Mist, an action that makes use of the style's mobility, when they would normally use Ki Pulse. The stance system also comes from sword kata, or forms, and it seemed wrong to apply that to ninja. That's why the same button activates both Mist and Ki Pulse. We wanted to create distinct styles of movement and combat, and that's why we made the decision to not give ninja Ki Pulse." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shibata adds, "There is a skill that allows you to dispel yokai realms by using Mist in Ninja Style." So while players won't be able to dispel them at first with Ninja Style, it will become possible as you progress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also ask Yasuda why the decision was made to limit Ki Pulse to Samurai Style. He replies, "Though Ki Pulse is a trademark mechanic in the Nioh series, we couldn't simply reuse it. We needed something ninja-like that would stand out. Part of why Ninja Style has the Mist action is because Samurai Style has Ki Pulse. The style didn't have Mist at first, but it was created in order to give it a play style just as distinctive as Ki Pulse."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n1-1757980540586.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the original name for Ki Pulse comes from a kendo term, Mist, or Kasumi in Japanese, is meant to bring to mind the speed and cloning abilities of a ninja. "I promise we didn't take it from Dead or Alive's Kasumi," Yasuda said with a laugh, referring to the name of a ninja character from the series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Dead or Alive references would be a bit too much to expect in Nioh 3, Ninja Gaiden 4 is in development. Could we see some elements from that series in the game? We ask Yasuda if we'll be able to use Ninja Gaiden-like techniques such as Izuna Drop. He responds promisingly, saying that "We'll look into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy." That said, it could be possible that such techniques or abilities are different from what we've seen in Ninja Gaiden.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/n2-1757980620187.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"There have already been Ninja Gaiden references in the Nioh series, such as in DLC,” says Yasuda. “This time we've gone so far as to add Ninja Style, and I think that players will be excited to see some of its elements given that Ninja Gaiden 4 is on the horizon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We expect these to be more like Easter eggs, so there's no telling if we'll be getting any major news announcements in the future about Ninja Gaiden elements in the game. They may even be put into the final game as surprises, so we're looking forward to checking the final game with a fine-tooth comb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out for more exclusive Nioh 3 coverage during this month's IGN First, including our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-exclusive-takeda-shingen-boss-reveal-gameplay-ign-first">exclusive boss battle</a> featuring the Tiger of Kai, Takeda Shingen! </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Yuichi Shigeta is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has confirmed the Xbox Game Pass September 2025 Wave 1 lineup of titles, which is headlined by beloved indie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades">Hades</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, available today, is Roadcraft, where you operate a fleet of authentic construction vehicles to restore roads and repair bridges. It's available on Xbox Game Pass Standard and Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomorrow, September 17, brings a flurry of titles to Xbox Game Pass Standard subscribers, which Ultimate owners will already have access to. These include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (the one from 2023, not 2011), roguelite tabletop-style role-player For the King 2, and the Game Preview version of city builder Overthrown.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also available tomorrow, September 17, is Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, a single-player survival shooter spin-off. It's available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a day later, September 18 brings the Xbox Series X/S version of Frostpunk 2 to Game Pass Ultimate, after its previous release on PC. This post-apocalyptic snow-ridden survival game is perfect for the chillier and, frankly, more depressing months. It's twinned with open-world physics sandbox Wobbly Life, which arrives for PC and Xbox Series X/S on the same day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's main attraction, Hades, turns up at the end of this week on September 19. Hades will likely need little introduction, though if you're yet to play this godly roguelike, the game's upcoming fifth anniversary will see it join Xbox Game Pass across Standard, PC and Ultimate tiers. Have at it!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's not all — Microsoft has packed the end of September with a further set of Game Pass arrivals, including PC strategy game Endless Legend 2 on September 22, co-op action roguelike Sworn on September 23, and Peppa Pig: World Adventures (yes, that's the one which stars and is also dedicated to the late Queen Elizabeth II) on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">September 25 is also when role-playing game fans get a chance to play Visions of Mana through Game Pass, whether you're a Standard, PC or Ultimate subscriber. The end of the month is then rounded out by isometric adventure classic Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light on September 30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, a sneak peek into October, which will bring the day-one launch of narrative adventure Sopa — Tale of the Stolen Potato on October 7, and a trio of additional games for Xbox Game Pass Core members.

                <p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has announced that the game will leave early access and launch its 1.0 version in 2026. Additionally, the studio teased that while the bulk of the team is working on updates, improvements, and more content for Palworld, the company also has smaller teams at work on new games.</p><h2><strong>Cleanup</strong></h2><p>Palworld 1.0 isn't launching sooner because Pocketpair is spending time now working on "cleanup" for the existing game.</p><p>"Beyond just adding new content, there is a lot of clean up that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game," the developer said. "We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>📢About Palworld Ver. 1.0</p><p>Hello everyone.<br>Palworld will officially release (Ver. 1.0) in 2026.</p><p>We are currently developing a massive amount of content for this milestone, and also planning some surprises for the rest of 2025.</p><p>Please watch the video below for more details: <a href="https://t.co/rpP5gmLtjs" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/rpP5gmLtjs</a></p></div>  — Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1967755319418724713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Pocketpair will remain mostly quiet for the remainder of 2025 as these efforts are underway, the studio said, while also cautioning fans that the Winter 2025 update won't be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-palworld-update-feybreak-is-arriving-on-december-23/1100-6528456/" data-ref-id="1100-6528456">Feybreak update in December 2024.</a></p><p>The studio went on to say that it has a "few surprises" planned for the Winter 2025 update for Palworld and that people should know that Pocketpair is "not slowing down or scaling back--quite the opposite."</p><h2><strong>Palworld 1.0</strong></h2><p>For the 1.0 release of Palworld, Pocketpair said fans can expect a "truly massive amount of content," and it's going to take time to get it all ready for release.</p><p>"Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end," the developer said, adding that it will reveal sneak peeks at some of the 1.0 content relatively soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20current%20state,closer%20to%20the%20official%20release.%E2%80%9D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld Steam early access FAQ</a> states that the price of the game might increase before 1.0. Right now, Palworld is discounted from $30 to $22.50, a deal that runs through September 22.</p><h2>New games</h2><p>Pocketpair's biggest and best-known game is, of course, Palworld, and the company plans to continue to grow and evolve the game over time. Simultaneously, the studio is plotting what may come next.</p><p>"As the company grows, we continue to experiment with other ideas for games," the developer said. There are "several smaller teams" inside Pocketpair working on new game ideas that "hopefully" turn into read products, the developer said, adding that more information about these efforts will come soon.</p><p>This is separate from Pocketpair's new Pocketpair Publishing division that seeks to help fund and market games from other studios.</p><h2><strong>Palworld history</strong></h2><p>Palworld launched in January 2024 for Xbox and PC, quickly becoming a massive hit, thanks in part to its inclusion with Xbox Game Pass. The game was a fast success, reaching millions of sales and installs, but the launch was marred with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-plagiarism-accusations-palworld-ceo-asks-people-to-stop-harassing-devs/1100-6520522/" data-ref-id="1100-6520522">controversy over plagiarism claims and other concerns.</a> The game bears a striking resemblance to Pokemon, and The Pokemon Company and Nintendo teamed up to sue Pocketpair, not for copyright infringement as some expected, but rather patent infringement claims.</p><p>Pocketpair subsequently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Poke Balls--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><p>Palworld later launched on PS5 in September 2024 and came to Mac in March 2025. Pocketpair would also go on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">partner with Sony for Palworld merch.</a></p>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, the hit animated film from Sony Pictures, is reportedly making its way into Fortnite, according to well-known leakers SpushFNBR and Loolo. The film, which combines KPop stardom with supernatural action, follows a fictional girl group called Huntr/x--idols by day, demon slayers by night. With songs performed by real-world KPop artists, the movie quickly became a cultural phenomenon, dominating music charts and becoming the most-watched original film in Netflix history.</p><p>While Epic Games has yet to confirm the crossover, the most likely additions to the game could be new dance emotes based on the film's choreographed musical numbers. Maybe even throw in some of The Saja Boys' Soda Pop routine, as it went viral over the summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922" data-ratio="0.41875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Netflix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg"></figure><p>Character skins based on the three members of Huntr/x are also a strong possibility. In the film, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira all have distinctive fashion and stylized weapons. Fortnite could easily include their fits from the introductory number "Done, Done, Done" to their more detailed outfits like they had in "Golden" (see above).</p><p>This potential collaboration would add KPop Demon Hunters to Fortnite's growing list of music-related crossovers. Previous collaborations have included in-game concerts and cosmetics featuring artists like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sabrina-carpenter-is-inspiring-fortnite-players-to-dance-not-fight/1100-6530729/" data-ref-id="1100-6530729">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-will-exclusively-debut-the-weeknds-new-popular-music-video/1100-6521121/" data-ref-id="1100-6521121">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bts-concert-kicks-off-in-fortnite-tonight/1100-6482420/" data-ref-id="1100-6482420">KPop group BTS</a>. Given the global success of the film and the ongoing popularity of KPop--and the mega success of the movie--this crossover could become one of Fortnite's most popular music-themed events yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Pocketpair has announced that its hit creature-catching open-world survival game,<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing" target="_blank">&nbsp;Palworld,&nbsp;</a>is finally launching out of Early Access and into version 1.0 in 2026. Palworld has been available in Early Access since January 2024, and centers on catching Pokémon-esque critters called Pals, which you can equip with guns to battle other monsters while aiding players in farming and crafting.&nbsp;</p><p>In a developer update video, Pocketpair promises that a “massive amount of content” is being planned for the 1.0 update. However, the studio also acknowledges it wants to clean up Palworld’s remaining technical bugs before it hits 1.0. &nbsp;</p><p>As such, the studio says the rest of 2025 will be “a little quiet from us” as it focuses on preparing the game for its full launch. Because cleaning up the game will be its primary focus, Pocketpair says its Winter update won’t be as big as last year’s Feybreak Island was, but stresses development will not slow down or scale back when it launches in full.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVIBHP37eM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The 1.0 announcement comes amidst an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-sue-palworld-developer-pocketpair">ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which began last September. The lawsuit, filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company, accuses Pocketpair of infringing on several patent rights.</p><p>Pocketpair publicly shared three specific patents from the lawsuit on its <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">website</a>, revealing they were registered after Palworld’s EA launch and were likely done to target the game specifically. These patents cover systems for capturing characters in a virtual space, an aiming system for deploying capture items, and rideable characters. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company seek payments of 5 million yen (plus late payment damages) each. Pocketpair stated it aimed to “assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p>

<p>Since launching into Early Access, Palworld has received five major updates introducing new Pals (the game’s monsters), raid battles, &nbsp;an <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/palworld-arena-is-a-pvp-arena-that-allows-you-to-fight-other-players">arena mode</a>, new landmasses like Feybreak and the island of Sakurajima, new factions, and even a crossover with Terraria. Pocketpair has also introduced many quality-of-life improvements and mechanics, such as cross-play.</p><p>Palworld is currently on sale for 25 percent off for a limited time on Steam. Palworld took the world by storm when it first launched into Early Access on Steam and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024, amassing over 25 million players within its first month of availability and becoming the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/31/palworld-had-the-biggest-third-party-xbox-game-pass-launch-ever">third-biggest launch on Xbox Game Pass</a> at the time.

            <p>
Alex Hernandez, the actor behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> protagonist Jacob Diaz, feared he may never work again following the game's disastrous reception.
</p>
<p>
Build A Rocket Boy's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">launched to major criticism due to its glitches and bugs</a>, not to mention shallow gameplay. Yet with his face on the game's cover art, Hernandez is intrinsically linked to the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's a difficult thing to spend two-and-a-half years on a project that you’re really proud of and you're proud of your contribution to it," said Hernandez on the latest <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-actor-alex-hernandez-thought-might-never-work-in-a-game-again-after-disastrous-launch/">FRVR Podcast</a>. "And I only had positive experiences working on it. The people I was working with, I was proud for them, of them, I wanted it to be a success for them just as much for myself."
</p>

<p>
He continued: "Just the response… I was like, 'I might never work in a game again'. Because one of the caveats of being the face on the box is that people, rightly or wrongly, will associate all of their opinions and, more importantly their emotions, about this game with my face," he said.
</p>
<p>
Still, Hernandez admits players are entitled to their opinions on the game, despite being on the receiving end of extreme vitriol.
</p>
<p>
"Gamers are a unique species, and I am one of them, where the attachment to the experience and the product is so strong, the feelings are so strong," he said, "and the internet is an anonymous place where people will share things they would never share to your face, ever, even if they actually hated it… they just wouldn't look you in the face and say, 'everyone who worked on this game deserved to die. This is f**king awful, these guys are idiots'. No one would ever say that to your face. And, I think, at the same time, you're entitled to that."
</p>
<p>
Previously, Hernandez provided the voice and likeness for Lincoln Clay in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, another game with a poor reception at launch. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm not a superstitious man, but I can't help but have some kind of Spidey Sense, like, 'Is it just me?' Do I have like the opposite of the golden touch, like the sh*t-brown touch, everything I touch turns to poop?" he joked.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-layoffs-build-a-rocket-boy-releases-mindseye-update-4-and-promises-its-committed-to-enhancing-the-gameplay-experience">Build A Rocket Boy has continued to update the game since</a>, and promised it's "committed" to enhancing the gameplay experience.
</p>
<p>
Still, the disastrous launch has put the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">future of publisher IOI Partners into question</a>. "So, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> will publish our own games internally," said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak. "IOI Partners? That remains to be seen."
</p>
<p>"Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">MindsEye review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/16/xbox-game-pass-september-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the second half of September 2025, and following up from the first half, it's even more strong indie titles with Hades and Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor among the over a dozen games being added, starting today.</p>



<p>Hades re-enters the subscription service just ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-launches-on-pc-and-nintendo-switch-this-month/">Hades II launching into 1.0 on September 25</a>, giving players a chance to dive back into the first game before the first sequel that developer Supergiant has ever made hits its full release.</p>



<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is the Deep Rock Galactic spin-off auto-shooter from Funday Games that's published by Ghost Ship's publishing arm. Like Hades II, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-releases-out-of-early-access-in-september/">Survivor is launching out of early access</a> this month, and it'll be available on Xbox Game Pass day one.</p>



<p>Other notable titles coming for the rest of the month include Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Frostpunk 2, Visions of Mana, and Sworn. There's also a game preview for Endless Legends II that'll be available on PC.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the rest of the month:</p>



<ul>
<li>Roadcraft - September 16 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>For the King II - September 17 - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Overthrown (Game Preview) - September 17 - Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor - September 17 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Frostpunk 2 - September 18 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Wobbly Life - September 18 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Hades - September 19 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>



<li>Endless Legend 2 (Game Preview) - September 22 - PC</li>



<li>Sworn - September 23 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Peppa Pig: World Adventures - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Visions of Mana - September 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light - September 30 - Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC</li>
</ul>



<p>And, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This time, it's a swell of Ninja Gaiden titles, with Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge all leaving the service, alongside Terra Invicta. They'll all be gone as of September 30, 2025.</p>

              <p>Pokémon cards. If it ain’t a story about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/target-removes-trading-cards-from-stores-after-violent-incident-with-gun.html">sudden acts of intimidation and threats of violence</a> over them, then it’s probably one about scalpers and reselling. Thankfully, no one got hurt (physically) this time as the Mega Evolution Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box (ETB), Booster Display Box, and Booster Bundle all sold out during their pre-order sale yesterday, with significant amounts of them going to folks who have no interest in actually using them to play the game. And they went <i>fast</i>. Some fans were lucky enough to still get through and lay claim to sets of their own, but the sting of seeing exorbitant listings on reselling sites still sucks.</p> <p>Expected to arrive on November 14, 2025, pre-orders for the latest <i>Pokémon </i>card game expansion went up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonRestocks/status/1967620548051218478">yesterday, September 15, 2025</a>, and, predictably, were sold out within 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-etbs-ebay-for-extortionate-prices/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>). And no, these very pretty-looking cards will not be finding homes with eager fans hoping to add them to their collections. Sadly, scalpers have filled eBay with pre-order listings for the new cards. Some are set at around normal prices, but a significant number of these listings are selling the cards for five times the retail price, hovering around $300, if not more in some cases.</p> <p>Scalpers didn’t soak up all the fun, however. On social media, many are <a href="https://x.com/ReyGambino_/status/1967626696045269047">celebrating a win</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/camyoin.bsky.social/post/3lyven5lodk2x">screenshots of successful pre-orders</a> of the new cards. That said, others ran into queue issues, getting bounced after only waiting for a short time, or in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/texasboy1060569/status/1967620858714992652">making it to checkout</a>, only to be bounced back in line. Others who made it to checkout were <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMulea96895/status/1967622801319424323">greeted by a mysterious “Error 17”</a> that then sent them back into the queue. Others hopelessly suffered as <a href="https://x.com/josejmurillo/status/1967624598754939237">they got bounced around in line</a> after multiple captcha checks to validate whether they were human or not.</p> <p>Adorned with a healthy splash of color, clearly the new Mega Charizard X ex is one of the main appeals of the new cards, along with Mega Gengar. I’m also really digging the moody, dark card sleeves. Shame that so few people will be buying them at normal prices any time soon.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At the beginning of the week, streamer and voice actor CDawg launched a <a href="https://canvas.cdawgva.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Canvas </a>page--an interactive pixel-based artboard that communities can contribute towards, which CDawg runs annually. Now, Neuro-Sama and her creator <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> have declared "war" on CDawg's Canvas, rallying their community to flood the board with Neuro-Sama-related artwork.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber, utilizing an impressive large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to read her own Twitch chat to directly respond to viewers. She currently holds the record for the largest Twitch Hype Train of all time, reaching level 111 with 84,904 subscriptions and 1,201,225 bits gifted to Vedal's channel during a "subathon" event in December 2024.</p><p>Shortly after the Canvas launched, CDawg, real name Connor, and his community set to work adding artwork of him, his best friend Ironmouse, and other streamers including Lord Aethelstan and Nyanners. As soon as Neuro-Sama's community became aware though, things changed. Fast.</p><p>Neuro-Sama's community, known as The Swarm, created a faction on the Canvas which, at the time of writing, has more than 9,000 members. Connor's own community faction consists of just under 3,000 members. The Swarm immediately began placing artwork of Neuro and her sister Evil, as well as her creator Vedal, mother Anny, and other associated streamers and content creators. By the time Connor woke up the following morning, the Canvas had been consumed with Neuro-related content.</p><p>During a stream on September 15, Neuro-Sama declared "war" on CDawg. Despite thinking Connor is a "pretty cool guy, although I'm not a fan of his hair," Neuro insisted she wanted The Swarm to "win." She also said, "100% Canvas is the minimum I would be satisfied with. I would like you to hold the line, please." Vedal agreed, saying, "That's the aim. This morning there was an attack. As far as I understand, a bunch of different streamers banded together to destroy our art, and this is what it looked like." Streamers, when given specific permissions from the Canvas owner, can get powerups including bombs, which wipe out large areas of the Canvas when faction members contribute to increasing its size. As a result, large areas of pixel art were completely removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893"></a><figcaption>Neuro-Sama observes the attacks from CDawg's community.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Over the following few hours, Vedal created a large template with the aim of consuming the majority of the Canvas. That template was quickly filled in by The Swarm, leaving a strong message to Connor and his community--"There is no Canvas that we do not answer. There is no Pixel that we betray. We are The Swarm." In fact, when Neuro requested help from her community to fill the Canvas, so many people attempted to join that the Canvas servers crashed, with many unable to access the site.</p><p>Neuro-Sama didn't want to take responsibility for the server crash, so decided to pin the issues on Connor. She doctored a (very obviously fake) screenshot of Connor claiming he had deliberately allocated just 8GB of RAM to the server. She then published this "evidence" as a webpage, which you can still see live on <a href="https://vedal.ai/cdawg_scam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vedal's website</a>. "Just remember, the next time you see a 'down server,' it's probably because CDawg is up to his old anti-Swarm tricks. This is only the beginning - expect more revelations soon," she signed off.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898"></a><figcaption>Neuro posted an exposure document about CDawg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png"></figure><p>It's important to note that Neuro and Vedal <em>do</em> have a goal in mind here. They've promised to hold back on their takeover of the Canvas if Connor hands over his stream key--the unique identifier used in OBS to link the software to a Twitch channel. This means that Neuro-Sama could, if she wanted to, stream via Connor's channel in a collaboration that has never happened before.</p><p>In a final interaction, Neuro-Sama and Connor spoke on a Discord call for the first time, with Connor immediately upsetting her--"I've never talked to a clanker before, this is my first time." Neuro set about her negotiations immediately, asking for his stream key. When asked what she could offer for Connor's stream key, she suggested a game of rock, paper, scissors, which didn't go too well since Connor just waited for Neuro's answer before responding. In a final act of desperation, Neuro-Sama asked Connor for a dinner date...four times.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxlDKFE1tgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gxlDKFE1tgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As it stands, Connor's stream key remains with him, The Swarm has agreed to help some other streamers get their artwork on the Canvas, and the site remains live until September 20. Will Neuro-Sama win the war she's declared, or will Connor successfully recruit enough streamers to take control back?</p><p>Of course, all of the bartering and negotiations are done in friendly jest, so this article also serves as a reminder to be kind on the internet, even if you belong to opposing factions.</p>

According to new data from the Game Developer Collective, developers are four times more likely to say generative AI technology will negatively impact the quality of games than they were a year ago. It's a rising concern from a community already wary of the technology due to its intense energy usage and lingering questions over the ethics and legality of training data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The statistics—gathered by our peers at Omdia by surveying members of the Game Developer Collective panel—shows a 13 percent increase in the number of developers concerned over product quality. The number rose from 34 percent in 2024 to 47 percent in 2025. Fewer developers expressed positivity about the technology, dipping from an already-scant 17 percent in 2024 to 11 percent in 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of respondents who said they were "neutral" on the topic or thought it would have no impact on quality also decreased.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We reached out to experts across the game industry to quiz them on the shift, casting a wide net to look at the topic from different backgrounds. Necrosoft Games founder and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Demonschool</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game director Brandon Sheffield argued the technology is part of a growing trend of companies "sanding off the edges" of games as an art form. "I'm not just talking about high-minded ideas…I'm talking about something as mechanics-oriented as 'what's a good jump' or 'what does a good assault rifle feel like?'" AI's tendency to replicate content from its training data is the primary weakness Sheffield is concerned with.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Games using [genAI] will be more generic, even if that's not immediately discernible to a player."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hiddendoor.co/">Hidden Door</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> CEO and founder Hilary Mason—herself a developer experienced with machine learning and genAI—expressed a similar sentiment.

		<p>THQ Nordic have announced that their new user generated racer, Wreckreation, will be out this October, and dropped a new trailer to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEMB3PehB38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For more on this game, got to preview Wreckreation and speak to Three Fields at Gamescom last year.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/28/wreckreation-preview-the-age-of-the-developer-is-over-the-age-of-the-player-begins-now/" aria-label="“Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”” (Edit)">Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”</a></h2>
<p>Wreckreation takes place in MixWorld, a 400km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;open world setting that combines racing with creation. The ‘live mix’ enables you to build and alter your racing track while you’re racing on it, and while there’s friends in the same space as you. And it’s not just boring old race tracks that are bound by the limits of reality and physics.&nbsp;You can drop audacious loops, ramps into the world, build up into the heavens with race track that arcs through the sky, and throw all manner of crazy props into the mix as well.</p>
<p>As a creation-based racer, Wreckreation will be building on a familiar feeling template for fans of games like ModNation Racers, Trackmania, and even Grand Theft Auto Online, but this will be custom built around the idea of creation within an online open world. It certainly looks different and the console market is screaming out for arcade racers so this should do well.</p>

<p>The game is coming from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/01/26/former-criterion-devs-three-field-entertainment-announce-dangerous-golf/">Three Fields Entertainment, the studio founded by Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward</a> after their departure from Criterion Games in 2014. The pair had led Criterion Games through the creation of their breakout hit Burnout and its sequels, as well as the shift to the Need for Speed franchise in the early 2010s, but when EA decided to downsize Criterion (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/12/need-for-speed-ps5-xbox-series-x-criterion-ghost-games-ea-gothenburg/">a decision they eventually backtracked on</a>), Sperry and Ward went their own way and founded Three Fields Entertainment.</p>
<p>Wreckreation will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on October 28th, 2025.</p>

<p>This time around, however, it's all about bug fixes (haaa...) and tweaks to Tools. Sharing the details on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">Steam</a>, the developer has detailed what these entail, with many of them focusing on enemies accidentally going out-of-bounds and certain Tools not doing the right amount of damage or not working as intended.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ohyixl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While fans should "Expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release", for now, it looks like this patch will be forgoing any more difficulty tweaks. That's not to say Team Cherry won't add any more later down the line, of course, but for now, things are staying as they are.</p>
<p>Currently, there's not a release date for the patch, but we imagine it'll drop in the next week or two.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">current patch notes</a>:</p>

			<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics took players back in time to an era of fighting games that plenty of fans longed to see come back. At least more than a million of them, as Capcom confirms that the arcade collection has officially surpassed one million copies sold, nearly a year to the day after its launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's great to see a collection that does a great job of bringing these older fighting classics back into the spotlight hit this sales milestone, especially for everyone hoping that this will be the start of Capcom releasing a new entry into the series with a proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 4.</p>



<p>There's been no official word as to whether it'll happen, but more than a million copies is not something to scoff at, and while it's not a MARVEL vs. CAPCOM game, Capcom has surely been paying attention to the attention that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Arc System Works' Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> has been getting.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for the sake of MARVEL vs. CAPCOM fans, Capcom sees that there's room enough for both games.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">Wccftech reviewed the fighting collection last year</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pigface-preview-cleaning-out-the-house.1299201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've just woken up in a grimy, dark warehouse. There's a throbbing in your head. The voice on the radio says he just implanted a bomb in your brain. Do what you're asked, or it's lights out. Forever.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;makes a strong first impression. I came in expecting more of a horror slant, as it publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow">DreadXP's</a> specialty, but was met with something more akin to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/immersive-sim" rel="nofollow">immersive sim</a>&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter/games" rel="nofollow">retro shooter elements</a>. This Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;offers a brief, but thrilling look at what we can expect in its full release, and now I'm chomping at the bit to see what's next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=5lgN0AH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=b1G5XmNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spray and pray.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Contract Killing in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em></h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pigface,&nbsp;</em>you're tasked with taking on various hits. You're essentially a cleaner, a professional at killing. Boot up your old, early 2000s laptop in the rundown apartment you live in and get to work. The first job is a farmhouse; apparently, some folks called "The Smilers" need killing. While you're at it, you'll need to grab a sample of their drugs and folders with info on their other hideouts.</p>

<p>With the money that you earn on jobs, you're able to purchase new equipment. This mostly comes in the form of guns, and as you progress, players can buy even better firearms and attachments for them. There are also melee weapons, body armor, morphine, and tools like landmines. Whatever you need to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=lOgdaQLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=jrN5Cg5a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I can here them walkin' around up there...</figcaption></figure><p>So for this first job, you're short on cash and it's actually pretty tricky with few tools at your disposal. The farm is inhabited by over 20 armed thugs, and you're given, essentially, nothing but the most basic items. The good news is, you can approach&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>'s levels in many different ways, which makes it feel quite a bit like an immersive sim.</p>

<p>Since I was surrounded by all sides by goons armed to the teeth, sneaking around was key. I didn't hit the farmhouse first since it was chock full of The Smilers, so I went to the barn and took out some thugs in a frantic firefight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, I make my way to the house on the property. It's a mini fortress, with sentries up high and patrols all around. Thankfully, I've got more ammo for a TEC-9 I scavenged.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=sa_efju9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=LISkHjZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dreaded silenced .357.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface</em>'s Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>Scavenging seems like a key component to&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, too, since ammo is a finite resource. You're not running around, picking up floating ammo refills. You'll have to make do with the guns of your enemies once you run out of your main weapon's ammo. If all else fails, use a melee weapon like a hammer, but that makes you extremely vulnerable. Use of cover and not rushing in head-on seems crucial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're pretty susceptible to gunfire in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, but enemies are equally so. Unlike, say, a boomer shooter, enemies drop down a bit quicker. A headshot is immediately lethal, but depending on the weapon, even a shot to the body may drop them for good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=piP08M5l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=X7NhqAUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He won't see this coming.</figcaption></figure><p>While at first you feel at a disadvantage with the number of enemies, later missions start to feel easier. Levels grow in both size and complexity, but the weapons and tools available to you level the playing field. I appreciate the flexibility players are given with their build, especially with weapon variety.</p>

<p>There are pistols, rifles, and machine guns, all of which behave different. Some of them have optional scope or silencer attachments, while others don't. Gunplay feels more realistic than your usual shooter. There isn't a reticle, so you're reliant on iron sights, though some guns don't even have that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some weapons could use some balancing, though, as they make&nbsp;<em>Pigface'</em>s missions far too trivial. I equipped myself with a scoped .357 magnum and sniped enemies from afar. They weren't able to tell where my bullets came from, so it was just a matter of picking everyone off one by one.</p>

<p>This was without a silencer attached to the magnum, by the way. Using a silencer would have made things even&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;since enemies can detect noise, so my choice in not using one was to add just a little bit of a challenge. Hopefully, in later builds, highly accurate, long-range weapons have a trade-off, so it's not so easy to abuse this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope the core gameplay loop of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;stays true to how it is currently. Completing objectives like eliminating certain targets or destroying drug-making materials in any manner I see fit is simple but enjoyable. The gunplay ticks all the right boxes, even if it doesn't feel like a traditional shooter, and if I can get even more fun guns to play with, all the better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is not necessarily completely original, but I enjoy look it's going for. The low-poly graphics and the piss-colored filter gives off a certain dark, brooding, edgy feel. It's an uncompromising, dirty, and extremely violent shooter involving some dirty work, so it all fits thematically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you're trudging through the sewers of a dilapidated suburb or shooting your way through a rinky-dink motel full of drugs and thugs, the Early Access for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is a promising first look. Who knows, there might even be a few surprises waiting for players in the future. I can't wait to see for myself!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s second patch is here ahead of an impeding full release, with Team Cherry having shared the notes and initiated Steam beta testing. No balancing tweaks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">this time around</a>, just a bunch more handy bug fixes that're well worth being aware of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're getting close to finalising the second post-release patch for Hollow Knight: Silksong," the studio wrote in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">post on Steam</a>. "Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools." They added that if you do opt to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">test it out via the beta branch</a>, you should "expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release".</p>
<p>As for the tweaks made thus far, you'll find 'em laid out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from Disgraced Chef Lugoli sometimes just deciding he's done with Hornet and nopeing out never to be seen again mid-fight, the one that's caught my eye is the death sequences messing up if you expire the moment you deal a fatal blow to a big baddie. Surely that's a) pretty tough to pull off and b) something that should offer a unique outcome. I'd say the boss' expiration going sideways in some hilarious fashion would count for the latter.</p><p>So, here's hoping Team Cherry add in a less troublesome bug to ensure anyone who pulls off the double death still get a quirky reward to ease their pain. Anyway, I'll stop waffling, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked really hard on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> hasn’t been <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-team-cherry-seth-goldman-2000625769">out for even two weeks yet</a> and it’s already getting its second patch. But for anyone still struggling in some of the game’s more brutal boss fights and platforming sections: don’t expect any more relief just yet. The Metroidvania Soulslike’s new update mostly takes aim at some of the smaller bugs fans are facing.</p> <p>“We’re getting close to finalizing the second post-release patch for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,” Team Cherry <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">announced</a> on Steam on Tuesday. “Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools.”</p> <p>While not live in the game on PC or console yet, players can test the fixes in the public beta branch on Valve’s storefront while the developers work on adding a few more fixes and improvements. Here’s the full patch notes so far for <em>Silksong</em> update 2:</p>

 <blockquote><p>– Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to ‘Off’.<br> – Updated Herald’s Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br> – Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br> – Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br> – Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br> – Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br> – Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br> – Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br> – Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br> – Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br> – Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br> – Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br> – Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br> – Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br> – Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br> – Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br> – Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br> – Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br> – Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br> – Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p></blockquote> <p>This patch will arrive as players continue to debate <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em>‘s difficulty</a> and whether some of the more challenging sections are hard for a reason or just annoying for no reason. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-notes-moorwing-2000624424">The game’s first patch</a> took aim at some of these complaints, including making the dreaded Moorwing boss fight easier to survive. There’s also been some debate over whether<em> Silksong</em> is too stingy with Rosary Beads, its main currency for purchasing equipment, unlocking benches (save spots), and other important resources for the adventure.</p> <p>Even some super fans of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> claim to have bounced off the sequel due to the more punishing gameplay. Team Cherry hasn’t signaled yet if it plans to eventually make deeper changes to<em> Silksong</em> to address some of these concerns, or add difficulty settings to help struggling players <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">experience more of its excellent world and story</a>.</p>

              <p>In 2005, a very inevitable-feeling game was released. In fact, it’s remarkable it was as late as that year that we first saw a video game based on the massive television hospital drama <em>ER.</em> The 1994 show that launched George Clooney’s career (if you don’t count <em>Roseanne</em>) had already lost the actor to Hollywood, and by 2005 was very much waning (down from a peak of 36 million viewers to 17.5m), albeit still four years from its eventual demise. Yet, honestly, there was no point in the show’s lifetime when&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> would have made a lick of sense. It remains one of the weirdest video games ever made. Let’s celebrate that.</p> <p>(To get this out of the way, when I say “20 years since,” this isn’t an exact measure. The game came out in the U.S. in May of 2005, but here in the UK it didn’t appear until September.)</p> <p><em>ER</em>, the TV show, certainly had a sense of humor, but it’s fair to say that it was very firmly a drama. These doctors were dealing with life and death, as well as lots of kissing, and there was that time Quentin Tarantino directed an episode. If you wanted silliness, you needed to change channels and watch the extraordinarily weird rival hospital drama <em>Chicago Hope.&nbsp;</em>So it remains a massive mystery how the video game incarnation of the series played like a spiritual sequel to Bullfrog’s&nbsp;<em>Theme Hospital</em>. This was a game in which you had to deal with an invasion of ninjas, and perform an operation while fairies danced around you and a football player kept appearing and disappearing at the foot of the bed.</p>

 <p>OK, let’s give this a bit of context. In 2004, EA’s&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em> had released, and controlling characters from an isometric view was big business.&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> very much mimicked the look of the&nbsp;<em>Sims</em> sequel, with its cut-off view of walled rooms and NPC characters roaming around the corridors. And like in <em>The Sims</em>, you had to control your character to perform a series of tasks within strict time limits while maintaining their hygiene, health, and relationships. It’s just, you had to do all this while being an intern in the Chicago hospital, surrounded by the characters from the show. And I really do mean the characters from the show. Completely improbably, frankly inexplicably, this game almost no one heard of, let alone played, starred proper members of the TV show’s cast as voice actors. Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, Mekhi Phifer, and Yvette Freeman all showed up, despite surely having nothing in their contracts that would have made them do so, voicing the doctors and nurses with whom you needed to get along. Sadly Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic were no-shows, and obviously Anthony Edwards and George Clooney were long gone, but still.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626003"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626003">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m not an expert in how real hospitals are run, but I’m reasonably sure that it’s not entirely a gift-based economy. Yet this is how <em>ER: The Game</em> pitched things, with your relationship statuses with your colleagues often decided by the presents you’d buy for them and receive from them. Even the patients would give you a present if they were happy with your performance. Along the way, you gained new skills and talents, each boosted by being in the positive company of more talented co-workers, as you treated patients for their broken bones, neurological issues, and toxicology-based troubles. It was the latter that led to the most memorable moments.</p>

 <p>It has been 20 years since I played this game, and tragically it’s no longer available to buy. (This is definitely one GOG needs to rescue.) I am delighted to say that I do, however, still have the DVD on which it was released. The only issue is I don’t own a DVD drive, and as such can only show it to my PC, which just stares nostalgically at the shiny plastic. Fortunately, I do have my memories, and a copy of the review I wrote for it back in a 2005 print edition of <em>PC Gamer</em>. Let me quote from it:</p> <blockquote><p>“It’s certainly the best rubbish game I’ve played in as long as I can remember.”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000626004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626004"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626004">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s remarkable how far the incompetently-made game’s utter weirdness carried it, the sheer charm of its absurdity making it a compelling play. And never more so than in that scene when my character started seeing fairies. It was a great level! Everyone was being so nice to me, and my medical skills were hugely improved. Even Dr. Pratt (Phifer) has stopped being a complete dick—the dude had taken a real disliking to me, and wouldn’t even talk about the weather when I tried to chat. The fairies dancing around the room did make the situation somewhat suspect, and like I said, there was that footballer in his full kit who would appear and disappear. That didn’t seem <em>quite</em> right. But it was still a disappointment when I woke up in a bed with Dr. Carter (Wyle) shouting at me. At this point, back in reality, the hospital had been invaded by a ninja and I was needed to help find him on the security cameras. One shift later I was kissing Dr. Carter.</p>

 <p>It’s a shame it was so badly made. The controls were a shambles, various systems made little to no sense, and the act of having a conversation with a janitor was technically more complicated than performing surgery on a child. But 20 years later, that shit only makes me like it even more. And it certainly helped that as busted as it might have been, the game was so bonkers that literally anything could happen, including a sudden mad rush of patients in cosplay after a disaster occurred at a sci-fi convention.</p> <p>Thank goodness for YouTubers, because you can still see the first 15 minutes of the game, complete with its utter lack of NPC pathfinding:</p>

  <p>It’s sad that as an industry we appear to be long past crappy TV tie-in games. Who can forget (no matter how hard they try) Telltale’s abysmal&nbsp;<em>CSI</em> games? Or&nbsp;<em>Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm</em>? Let alone&nbsp;<em>Prison Break: The Conspiracy</em>. And no, Netflix churning out mobile games for each new commission doesn’t count. We need more terrible games based on big-name franchises, or what’s even the point?</p> <p>Meanwhile, I’m beginning my campaign for GOG to rescue&nbsp;<em>ER</em> from obscurity, so I don’t have to be the only person who even remembers it.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Job sims today encompass so many different professions, from train operator to farmer to power washer and beyond. Sometimes I enjoy those kinds of games, but I expect <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3283240" rel="nofollow">The Lift</a> to be my favorite of them going forward, because it takes the job sim genre and makes it spooky and weird.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7M_OYzkiBM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h7M_OYzkiBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Inspired by the New Weird movement, which defines things like the SCP Foundation and Pacific Drive, The Lift casts you as a handyman who fixes benches, replaces light bulbs, and reroutes electricity in a facility that quite closely resembles the setting of Control. It's for that reason I've already coined its alternate title: The Oldest House Flipper. A playtest for the game is out today on Steam, free for all players. I got to check it out last week in a hands-on demo that showed off about three hours of the game, including its earliest moments and some later stages. What I saw was a game that pulls from many of my favorites but wraps them together in a novel way.</p><p dir="ltr">The facility at the heart of The Lift, called The Institute, feels like it's pulled right out of Remedy's New Weird foray, complete with a once-orderly workspace now left mysteriously abandoned and endangered. As the "Keeper" sent in to keep things tidy, you'll need to solve BioShock-like electricity puzzles, clean up mystical black gunk coating much of the place, and explore the world in a manner inspired by immersive sims. Particularly inspirational to the game's designs is one of my favorite games ever made: 2017's Prey. Finding new crafting blueprints, then dumping resources into a giant machine where it spits out new, more valuable parts, is pulled directly out of Prey--even the room that houses this multi-machine process resembles Prey's.</p><p dir="ltr">The new team behind the game, Fantastic Signals, said the non-linear progression through The Facility is also meant to harken back to Prey and im-sims like it, where multiple solutions can be used to solve many problems, and where tools you unlock later in the game can alter how you interact with spaces you revisit. But all of that is joined by the odd wrapper of a job sim, making it appear like those other games I love in some obvious ways while still being quite unlike them at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552"></a><figcaption>There are bad days at the office, and then there are days where you get consumed by whatever this stuff is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In The Lift, each floor you visit has what amounts to a functionality rating. It's your job to repair things until the floor is working as usual again. Virtual elbow grease is the name of the game. You'll reroute the electricity to fix vending machines that spit out working light bulbs, then replace faulty ones nearby, raising your functionality rating by small bits at a time. You'll charge a handheld vacuum-like object that removes oily coatings from benches and doorways, opening up new passageways that further aid you on your quest to fix the mysterious facility left in a state of disrepair.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift is a game of pulling levers and fiddling with doo-dads in the way a lot of job sims already are. It's a game that loves when you ask, "What's this button do?" and doesn't punish you for pushing those buttons, even when they lead to failure. If you run out of energy for your vacuum, you can go get more at the machine that dispenses it. If you borrowed some parts from that machine to repair something else, no worries; you can just go and undo that. The levels I saw didn't clearly define which way I was meant to go, which left me with a sense of self-guided discovery. Reading displays and observing the effect I could have on each level taught me how I could have an effect on The Facility more than a simple tool tip could. The zig-zaggy way of problem-solving is pulled right out of immersive sims, and is a quality I'm always looking for in games. I just didn't know I'd want it in a job sim. But so far, The Lift works (no pun intended).</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline that unfolds focuses on slowly unraveling the mystery of what happened to The Facility before you were sent in to fix it. Soviet-style propaganda posters line many walls, notes can be found, and these and other breadcrumbs are meant to intrigue you to finish each workday and make it to the next floor. The developers played a bit coy when, during a roundtable discussion, they were asked about the presence of enemy threats--given their comparisons to Pacific Drive, I'm expecting something more like that game's anomalies than true "enemies," but the jury's still out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553"></a><figcaption>Everything in The Lift feels meant to be flipped, pushed, toggled, or otherwise fidgeted with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's a lot I don't yet know about The Lift, and frankly, given the combination of genres and very hands-on mechanics, I even find it a bit hard to describe. Luckily, the playtest is out now, so I think the best way to speak to it is how I led with it: If you're into stuff like Control, Prey, and Pacific Drive, and you're curious how those games would look as a job sim, you're in luck: Fantastic Signals had the same question, and then they went and answered it themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift comes to PC in 2026, with console versions coming at a later date.</p>

            <p>
A PS5 system update is due tomorrow that will finally add controller pairing across multiple devices.
</p>
<p>
It means if you're using your DualSense controller across more than one console - or for PC or mobile play, for instance - you will no longer need to pair it each time.
</p>
<p>
This update was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-system-update-will-finally-add-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices">detailed by Sony back in July</a>, but finally it will be available globally for users from tomorrow, 17th September.
</p>
<p>
The update will also add Power Saver mode, which will scale back performance to reduce power consumption. Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, Demon's Souls, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will make use of this feature.
</p>
<p>
Full details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/">PlayStation Blog</a>.
