<p>C. Viper returns this Autumn</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following a leak earlier on, Capcom has now officially released the teaser trailer for the next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> DLC character.</p>
<p>The secret agent C. Viper, who originally made her debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Street Fighter IV</a>, is scheduled to arrive in Street Fighter 6's World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Grounds on <strong>Autumn 2025</strong> for all platforms including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>She's part of the game's third year of DLC, which also includes Sagat (out this week), as well as Alex (<strong>Early Spring 2026</strong>) and Ingrid (<strong>Late Spring 2026</strong>).</p>

<p>In addition to this, Capcom has released a new trailer for the next batch of DLC outfits coming to the game.</p>

<p>Apart from these new trailers for Street Fighter 6, one other Capcom announcement at EVO 2025 was a free title update for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/capcom_fighting_collection_2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>. It's out this week and will add Ingrid as well as multiple other characters to Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this and Street Fighter 6 in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life. There's also a demo for the sixth entry available on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Evo 2025 fighting game tournament, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guilty-gear-strive">Guilty Gear Strive</a> developer Arc System Works revealed a first look at Lucy from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/cyberpunk-edgerunners">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a>, and confirmed an August 21 release date for the DLC guest character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lucy is the final playable character from Strive’s Season Pass 4, and is lifted from the hugely popular Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Netflix anime that followed the release of CD Projekt’s Cyberpunk 2077. And anyone who’s played the game will instantly recognize the hacking mechanic we see in the gameplay trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Time pauses as Lucy selects from a number of Quickhacks, such as Algorithm Malfunction, Optics Inhibition, and Energy Siphon, using Cyberdeck Ram in the same limited fashion you do in Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then see Lucy’s opponent afflicted with the hacking debuffs via icons that display above their character. These icons are the same from Cyberpunk 2077, and appear to clear quite quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does Lucy mark the end of DLC for Guilty Gear Stive? Four years after its launch, it seems more is to come. Arc System Works tweeted to say Guilty Gear Strive “will continue… we look forward to your continued support.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GGST?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GGST</a> will continue...<br>We look forward to your continued support.<br>皆様の応援を引き続きよろしくお願いします！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%AE%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ギルティギア</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GuiltyGearStrive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GuiltyGearStrive</a> <a href="https://t.co/lQKiDyIEV3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lQKiDyIEV3</a></p>— GUILTY GEAR OFFICIAL (@GUILTYGEAR_PR) <a href="https://twitter.com/GUILTYGEAR_PR/status/1952101221357232187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That message came alongside a video that revealed Strive has had 3.5 million players since launch, and announced Guilty Gear Strive 2.00, coming at some point in 2026. What that means for gameplay is anyone's guess right now. Perhaps of more interest, the video teased two new characters, which fans are speculating are Robo-Ky and Jam Kuradoberi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible supervillain Omni-Man is a playable character in fighting game Invincible VS. The announcement came as part of the EVO tournament alongside a first look at gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS is the upcoming 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe. It’s developed by Skybound Entertainment’s first in-house game studio, Quarter Up, and already has a number of confirmed playable characters, including Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Thula, Bulletproof, Rex Splode, and Battle Beast. Now we can add Omni-Man to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Omni-Man:</p><blockquote>A versatile and brutal fighter, Omni-Man is an excellent pick for or against any team composition. His versatile move set offers options at all ranges: he can apply pressure from a distance with his concussive blast, punish reckless advances with anti-air tools, or close the gap in an instant with his sudden and devastating takedowns. Balanced, efficient and relentless, Omni-Man is a top-tier “point” character for players who want to set the pace from the very first hit.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn’t Omni-Man’s first foray into the world of fighting games. He was a popular guest character in the equally gory Mortal Kombat 1, which included some of his iconic scenes as Fatalities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we now know seven playable characters in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/invincible-vs"><u>Invincible VS</u></a>. There will be more, of course. But just how many? Based on comments from Invincible creator Robert Kirkman in an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-teases-massive-roster-of-playable-characters-for-invincible-vs-thats-a-spoiler-i-might-get-in-trouble-for-that-sdcc-2025">Invincible VS will have a massive roster</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fresh from his SDCC 2025 panel where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/robert-kirkman-reveals-battle-beast-as-a-playable-character-in-invincible-vs-with-debut-trailer-sdcc-2025"><u>he announced Battle Beast for Invincible VS</u></a>, Kirkman told IGN that if fans are wondering if a specific character from either the Invincible comic or the Prime Video animated series will be in the game, there’s a “99%” chance they will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's so much care being put into being true to the Invincible universe,” Kirkman began. “So if you're a fan of the comics or the show and you're like, ‘Oh, there's a fighting game coming, who would I like to be in that fighting game?’ There's a 99% chance they're going to be in the game. I'll just say that. That's a spoiler. I might get in trouble for that. I don't know.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Battle Beast Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirkman continued: “The lineup is going to be absolutely insane. I'm so glad that we announced Battle Beast. You can't do an Invincible fighting game without having Battle Beast be one of the playable characters. There are other characters like that that will more than likely be in the game. So we'll see. We've got a lot of announcements to roll out. There's a really great team working on this and I can't wait for people to see everything is going into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who would you like to see playable in Invincible VS? Let us know in the comments below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when Invincible VS will be released, Kirkman said 2026, which we already knew, but then he added: “Sooner than you may think… But next year. I'm not being specific.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-season-4s-dinosaurus-has-a-voice-actor-robert-kirkman-says-7-9-seasons-needed-to-do-the-complete-comic-arc-jokes-season-5-will-be-out-in-2032-sdcc-2025"><u>everything announced during Robert Kirkman's Invincible panel at SDCC 2025</u></a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Dk map article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4782dfb7bef11/dk-map-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot of fun to be had in smashing the place to tiny little voxel pieces in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, it's easily its biggest draw. People have been into the sweet catharsis of wanton destruction since way back before there were even people. Probably.</p>
<p>However, the one thing that's caught my attention most whilst playing thus far - and I must admit, I'm only around about halfway through the campaign at this point - is the game's absolutely beautiful world map design. I love it.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn't have the same level of interactivity and usefulness as some other games do, and sometimes it gets lost when you've dug through miles of terrain, but it's not about that. Donkey Kong Bananza's map's strength lies in how it gives you the actual level you are on, fully realised as adorable 3D miniature, like a diorama that you can swirl around and see exactly what is in front, to the side, above, below and beyond you.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>When you press the map button, the camera zips you up and out of the level to look down upon the earth like some sort of hairy, banana-addled God. What's more, it tallies all of your actions and activities and replicates all the damage you've done across the layer. It's a magic, real-time tracker kind of thing, and it's got me dazzled.</p>
<p>There's almost a game within a game here where you can set points of interest or places you want to get to just for fun, rather than for the sake of progression, and then work through the area both in-game and through the map, jumping seamlessly too and fro, in order to do some satisfying messing around and discovering. I love how it orientates you, too. Jump into this map and direct yourself towards something, then back out and DK is pointed where you are headed.</p>
<p>It also allows you to do fun things with the landscape. I mean, who knows what I could sculpt that great big mountain in the distance into if I really <em>think</em> about it? And when I've decided, I can go into the map to get a bird's eye view on the progress of my mountain that's shaped like Wario's butt. Woah! Wait a minute.... Where did that come from?</p>

<p>The more intricate the level, the more impressed I am. I've spent far too much time spinning these maps around and resetting the terrain so it's all fresh and new and ready to destroy all over again. And, for a game that's got so much going on elsewhere, this ingenious little map really has become the cherry on top for me.</p>
<p>Of course Nintendo is no stranger to the World Of Very Good World Maps™. In fact, one of my earliest and most lasting memories of gaming is how blown away I was by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</a>'s map back in the days when I'd play my full-colour games on a barely working black and white TV. Yes, I am a dinosaur. And a bald one, to boot.</p>
<p>The parallaxing wonder that was A Link to the Past's map though, my goodness. And <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/5j835r/map_of_hyrule_legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past/">you got a paper copy of it in the box as well</a>. Halcyon days. It was the first time I'd seen a map and thought of it as an organic and useful part of a game as a whole. It wasn't some stuffy menu that was separated off; it put you above the world, not removed temporarily to the back rooms, still in-game, just from a different perspective. It's amazing how much this adds to the escapism of an adventure. It certainly had 13 year old me more invested in a game than I'd ever been before.</p>

<p>Zelda has continued to innovate and impress in the cartography department, too. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> give us these enormously complex maps that show you where you need to go and where you've just been. They also retain the magic of A Link to the Past's effort by teasing you ahead of time, showing you places that you want to go, intriguing things you want to see or mess with. These maps do their jobs by being a guiding companion, but they also keep you hooked by enhancing the game's ability to embed you in its world.</p>
<p>Then we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, another game that absolutely floored me with its map. Previously I'd found Metroid a little tortuous — sometimes you blame yourself in tough situations, saying you're just not good enough or patient enough to play that type of game. But it was the map's fault! Blame the game, give yourself a mental health break. As soon as you popped in Super Metroid's cartridge, with its incredibly useful maze of a map, everything clicked into place. Ah yes, this is why people like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and why there are <em>so many</em> Metroidvanias out there. Thanks maps!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_dread">Metroid Dread</a> carries on in the same glorious vein; its map is another ludicrously labyrinthian affair, but your path and location remain crystal clear an all times. And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_trilogy">Prime Trilogy</a> map, well, it's just more of that good gravy. Not as fundamentally game-changing as its predecessors, perhaps, but certainly showing that the love is still there, and now lifted into three dimensions. It makes me sick to think about how complicated creating this stuff must be, which is a sure sign that it's a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> is another example of a map I was in love with as a kid. Again, not the most useful, overall, but it doesn't need to be. It looks amazing, it's interactive as you move across the paths that link all the levels together, and it keeps you in the world, in that <em>not-real-life</em> headspace, which is where I belong.</p>
<p>And just like all the other games mentioned, it teases you in the same ways. You immediately need to know where all those little caves go, what that suspicious patch is over there, etc. And all of this is to speak nothing on how the map designs add to, or even speak to, the style, the vibe, and the architecture of the worlds that they're a part of. They fit, they enhance and they improve.</p>

<p>So, whilst smashing the place to a billion beautiful pieces in Bananza, zipping in and out of its map, twirling and zooming, plotting and planning, I've been reminded in a wonderfully nostalgic burst of all this lovely stuff. It's nice to see that, as much as the technology may change and gamers might want different things from the experiences they buy into, Nintendo has stuck to giving us some of the best maps in the industry.</p>
<p>When you think about all these maps, especially with how complex the latest Zelda ones have been, it feels like a bit of a full circle moment that, in DK's latest outing; you get to tear the map apart until there's nothing but the skeleton of a world remaining.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned AMD leaker KeplerL2 has revealed in a series of posts on the NeoGaf board (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mgijwx/keplerl2_xbox_xs_hardware_has_sold_less_than_30/?share_id=Ch1EvdKxiKZjo7CR5NGHO&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>) that the Xbox Series S and X consoles have sold less than 30 million units, according to his estimates based on AMD sales data.</p>



<p><em>They aren't even at 30 million. You don't need third party trackers, you can use AMD's number and Sony's number to figure out Xbox sales. Steam Deck is part of SCBU and counted as a console; Van Gogh and all its variants were developed by SCBU (Semi-Custom Business Unit) and fall under the same reporting as the consoles. Z1/Z2 are repurposed laptop chips (Rembrandt/Phoenix/Strix) and fall under the Client segment.</em></p>



<p><em>It is also important to note that AMD's number is higher than what Sony/Xbox would count as unit sales since it includes chips sold but still in-flight (i.e., being assembled somewhere).<br>So Q3 &lt;100 million console units with ~66 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck would put Xbox Series S and X at a maximum of 29 million. Q4 &gt;100 million console units with ~75 million PS5 and ~4 million Steam Deck means Xbox sold a minimum of 21 million units. So, Xbox sales for this gen range from a minimum of 21 million + Q1/Q2 2025 unit sales to a maximum of 29 million + Q4 2024 + Q1/Q2 2025.</em></p>



<p>This means Sony's PlayStation 5 could have around three times the install base of Microsoft's Xbox duo. The choice to create a lower priced model, the Series S, was not nearly enough to stop the constantly dwindling sales. Even in the last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otherwise profitable quarter</a>, Xbox hardware sales decreased 22% on a year-over-year basis.</p>



<p>At least the Xbox Series S and X are not sold at a loss anymore, according to KeplerL2, unlike Sony's PlayStation 5:</p>



<p><em>PS5 had a brief period of being even/profitable, but then component prices went up (N7 wafers, GDDR6, and a few others), and it went right back to losing money. As far as I know, the regular PS5 is still sold at a minor loss; only the PS5 Pro is profitable. They did a die shrink for the Series X and raised prices; it should be profitable now.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Gotta' get them all.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon is one of those franchises that has infiltrated pretty much every medium. Whether you're a fan of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">Pokémon games</a>, anime, or the trading card game, there is a seemingly endless amount of new content for you to peruse at any given time. There's so much, in fact, that it can almost be hard to find the perfect Pokémon gift for yourself or the fan in your life without trudging through piles of search results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, if you're specifically looking for a really cool Pokémon jigsaw puzzle, I have scouted out this specific topic for you. Below I've listed out some of the very best options currently available on Amazon for both adults and kids of varying ages. Some of these puzzles are a <em>lot</em> more challenging than others, so just make sure you check the piece count before you bite off more than you can chew.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">A good challenge for adults</h3><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218908"><div id="218908" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ravensburger Pokémon Challenge Jigsaw Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Pokémon puzzle I'd recommend is for more advanced puzzlers. It's 1,000 pieces and is stamped with the Ravensburger "Challenge" title, meaning it's not going to be a quick one. Featuring all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/pokedex">original 150 Pokémon</a> all in one picture, it's a nostalgic blast from the past and fun to put together. It also comes from Ravensburger, which is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">most-trusted jigsaw puzzle brands</a> out there. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For fans of the video games</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218909"><div id="218909" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Retro Pixel Pokémon Chart Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Great for fans of the original video games.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're anything like me, you likely have fond memories of playing Pokémon on your Game Boy for hours on end and this puzzle hits a similar nostalgic vein. This glorious 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle from Buffalo Games showcases the original 150 Pokémon once again, but this time they are pixelated and perfectly organized. With the higher piece count and nice blue border around the edges, this Pokémon puzzle is a great option for anyone looking to proudly frame and display their completed work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like the piece count on this puzzle, you should also check out our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">largest puzzles available now</a>. They scale up beyond 40,000 pieces.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">For younger kids</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218910"><div id="218910" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Pokémon Fan Favorites Puzzle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first two puzzles on this list are targeted more toward adults, but if you're looking for a good option for younger kids, this 100 piece puzzle is my top pick. It features a ton of fan favorite Pokémon, primarily from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation. You can see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/Rayquaza">Rayquaza</a> right in the middle there and Pikachu all the way at the bottom. At 100 pieces it's fairly easy for younger kids to piece together while still providing a really cool image for fans of the franchise.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Starter option for preschoolers</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="218911"><div id="218911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Buffalo Games Four Pokémon Puzzle Boards</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Starter puzzles for preschoolers.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a good puzzle gift for kids just getting into puzzles, this four pack is an excellent option. It says it's made for ages 4+, but I got this same pack for my niece and nephew when they were around three years old and they had no problem putting it together. Each puzzle depicts a different set of Pokémon and features between 12 and 48 pieces so kids can scale up the difficulty if they are really into it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3D Master Ball Puzzle</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">The best Pokemon puzzle gift</h3></div><div catalogid="c3a6b419-b4cc-4399-b374-1b88d3054152" id="219020"><div id="219020" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>3D Master Ball Puzzle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A good gift for all ages.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-toys">best Pokémon toys</a> on the market are Poké Balls. So naturally, there is a 3D puzzle version available. At only 54 pieces, it's fairly easy to put together and even easier to display. It comes with a stand that will hold your completed puzzle up on a shelf or a desk. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">best puzzle gifts</a> currently available for Pokémon fans right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Pokémon Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who has done quite a bit of puzzle research (and quite a bit of puzzling), I have a few suggestions to help you narrow down your search for the perfect fit. Here are a couple of key things to look out for when buying a Pokémon puzzle:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure it's a trusted brand</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you'll want to do before you buy <em>any </em>jigsaw puzzle online is check what brand it's from. There are some puzzle brands that are more trusted than others, many of which I've featured on this list already. A good brand tends to have higher quality puzzles, which means higher quality materials. And for Pokémon puzzles specifically, they will likely be selling the puzzles in an official capacity via licensing the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When in doubt, I'd suggest reading through Amazon reviews to see what people thought. Things to watch out for are missing pieces, thin cardboard, and obvious AI usage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get the right piece count for the occasion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important thing to think about is who you're buying the puzzle for. If it's a gift for an experienced puzzler, 1,000 pieces and above is probably ideal. But if it's for a novice or a younger audience, then 500 or below is probably your best bet. Larger puzzles tend to take a <em>lot </em>longer and if you don't have a dedicated space set up for puzzling you'll likely never finish. This is where a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table</a> really comes in handy.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 3, 2025 2:30 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3><div data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="article-subtitle">Not yet available for streaming.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The Silent Hill fandom is seemingly split once again, this time over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s "soulslike" combat.</p>
<p>As more and more teasers and footage pop up online in the run-up to 25th September's launch day, fans are getting stuck into all the new gameplay. But while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>", fans are concerned about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">how enemies react</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mg6fn0/the_small_hypocrisy_im_seeing_for_silent_hill_f/">degradable weapons</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">"soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>"The game is looking incredible overall in terms of detail and quality. The amount of work the devs have put in is really impressive. That said, I’m a bit worried about how the combat is shaping up, specifically, how enemies react (or don’t react) when taking hits," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mggyrw/silent_hill_f_looks_great_but_the_enemy_combat/">said one player</a>.</p>

<p>"Why, I can't guy[s] please don't tell me it's true," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf7e5l/why_are_they_making_silent_hill_a_soulslike/">lamented one fan</a>. "I love this series and I'm really hyped for the game, but please game devs, don't take this route, don't sacrifice what this series is know [sic] for to trend chase. Don't alienate your audience. I'm honestly scared if this is the direction there [sic] taking this series."</p>
<p>"The combat certainly concerns me. Even if it ends up being amazing, I feel apprehensive about a Silent Hill game having combat that evokes the counter timings of Sekiro," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf9o9e/comment/n6fl6ds/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> someone else. "Hopefully they pull a Bloober and prove me wrong. At the very least, I hope it’s a good horror game even if it ends up failing as a Silent Hill game."</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn't the first time the series has dabbled with degradable weapons – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> and Silent Hill Origins did, too, although how successful that was lies in the eye of the player, I guess. The problem for some, however, is how those degradable weapons could inhibit exploration.</p>
<p>"I'd like to scour the in-game world and pick up all the details/memos, but if I'm burning through my decent weapons at every stop to do so, I'm eventually gonna stop exploring to conserve resources," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mf2maj/comment/n6ffoo9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">suggested one fan</a>.</p>
<p>As for the other complaints? Well, there were plenty of those for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> in the run-up to release, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">turned out to be one of my favourite games in years</a> (and what I think is the only 5/5 I've awarded in all the years I've reviewed here). So the good news is, regardless of how the previews are making fans feel, September will be here before we know it.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yes, hello folks, it's your regularly scheduled eShop Selects, this time for July 2025. As always, we're looking at the best of the rest — the best eShop exclusives you may have missed on Switch 1 and Switch 2. Yes, other games besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> <em>did</em> come out, you know?</p>
<p>A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has kept the future looking bright for both consoles, so let's peel through the rules because we have a good one this month; our writers and contributors vote for their top three games from our pile of reviews of eShop exclusives that launched in July 2025. Those games are then scored (with 1 getting the highest score, 3 the lowest), then we tally the results up and the trio with the highest total make our top three.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ujloqh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Before we dive in, yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is missing here, we know — review codes for the Switch release weren't available until launch day (the very last day of the month).

<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">3rd Place - Time Flies</a></h2>
<p>Here's an odd gem we've had an eye on since a Day of the Devs stream a few years ago. Time Flies is a philosophical tale about a fly who only has a short amount of time to live. What can they do in that small slice of life they were handed from birth? Whatever they want.</p>
<p>Did you know flies can get drunk? Or make music? Or not be annoying? And look, we're not saying the timing of releasing after Mario Paint arrived on NSO (with that fly swatting game) was prophetic, but... okay, look, the art style is so similar.</p>
<p>Time Flies is short, sweet, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/time-flies">an excellent 8/10 pick-up</a> for the Switch.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">2nd Place - Monument Valley 3</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Monument Valley</strong> series feels like a no-brainer for Switch, but amazingly, it took until this year to get <em>any</em> of the games on the hybrid series. Fortunately, the newest entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, followed soon after. And it's just as excellent.</p>
<p>The lack of touch controls might be a dampener, but there's some incredibly thoughtful and clever puzzling to experience here. It's also beautiful to look at, with stunning uses of colour and perspective to make each puzzle shine. it might be the easiest of the trio, but it's still well worth a go.</p>
<p>Have a read of our review if you want to know more; it more than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/monument-valley-iii">earned its 8/10</a>.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">1st Place - Patapon 1+2 Replay</a></h2>
<p>There was a clear winner for July, with the PSP's darling making a bold multiplatform comeback courtesy of Bandai Namco. That's right, it's all about 'pata-pata-pon-pon!' Congratulations to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, which got votes from all but one participant.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what Patapon is, you're basically an invisible entity commanding a group of strange creatures to the beat of their music. They'll react to your drum beats and run, guard, attack, and rush. Every single song is a complete earworm, and with all the helpful little features added into this version, both games have never played better.</p>
<p>We may have scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/patapon-1plus2-replay">a 7/10</a>, but it's still marched its way into our hearts.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-july-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While new viral hit Peak can often feel as challenging as it is fun to play, rumour has it that in the next day or so, the procedurally-generated map won't be tricky as much as it'll be unbeatable. Whoops.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media yesterday, developer Aggro Crab confessed that a modder on Discord had discovered an upcoming map will position a campfire – which players need to light in order to proceed to the next biome – on top of an "unreachable" tree.</p>

<p>"A modder in Discord has informed me that in two days there will be a map where the campfire spawns in an unreachable tree," the developer confessed. "Chat, do I go to the office on Saturday to fix this." The message was appended with a slew of crying emojis.</p> <div>

<p>Though Aggro Crab didn't specify what mod gave the player an early head's up, it's likely they're talking about the seed mod that lets people select a seed in config (in this case, it's <a href="https://x.com/digi_the_robot/status/1951899207390126389">reportedly</a> level_8).</p>
<p>The message spawned hundreds of replies, ranging from "<a href="https://x.com/Ringer_53/status/1951527964778074393">Nah, we'll live. Ruining your weekend over it is not worth it</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/ZeroNyxia/status/1951585271243292743">new difficulty unlocked</a>", to "<a href="https://x.com/blockxs/status/1951531975489073554">skip the office, embrace chaos</a>", which I think I may adopt as my new mantra for life.</p>
<p>"Just add a sign that says good luck lol," <a href="https://x.com/LucarnAnderson/status/1951633892513083696">wrote</a> someone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the decision was made to leave it be.</p>
<p>"I think with those you can make it [with a chain launcher or anti rope], so maybe fk it we ball," the developer eventually <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1951533385375162582">declared</a>.</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourself-peak-fans-aggro-crab-reckons-you-can-get-to-an-unreachable-campfire-thats-coming-up-soon]]></content:encoded>
