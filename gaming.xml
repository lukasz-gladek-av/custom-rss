            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>’s whopping Space Age expansion has been in the works for <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-74">a good few years now</a>, and we finally know when we’ll get our hands on it. Space Age will arrive this October alongside a major 2.0 update for the moreish factory-automating hit, with the expansion costing as much as the base game. It sounds like there’ll be plenty to show for that price, mind.</p>

<p>Space Age <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorios-huge-space-age-expansion-will-let-you-build-conveyor-belts-among-the-stars">got a proper reveal last summer</a>, with developers Wube revealing its addition of five new planets - complete with new resources and technology to contend with - and the new ability to build space platforms after the end of the original game’s levels. Those space platforms will need defending from asteroids, either by shooting them down or catching them to refine into useful resources, with the operational platforms working to send cargo between planets.</p>
<p>The new planets will include the volcanic Vulcanus, where Tungsten allows for new metallurgic tech and lava can be used to smelt iron and copper. Fulgora, meanwhile, is a desolate planet racked by lightning storms that can be harnessed for electrical power, especially when used together with the new material of Holmium, while the remains of a lost civilisation can be dug up and turned into new items. There’s also a swampy planet, Gleba, full of fruit and biochemicals, while the devs tease a fifth planet that “promises some of the most unique gameplay” among its dark and cold landscape far from the sun.</p>
<p><a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418">Other additions</a> in the expansion include elevated train tracks to cross over terrain or simply lift rails above each other for more transportation, new enemies and ways to defend against them, and quality tiers for items, entities and equipment that grant various bonuses as you advance them across five levels from Normal quality up to Legendary - whether that’s better range, faster crafting or something else.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/factorio-space-age-conveyor-belts.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wube</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, it sounds like there’ll be a lot, with Wube previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorio-expansion-goal-is-to-feel-as-big-an-addition-as-the-whole-vanilla-game">comparing the size of Space Age to the original game</a>, without taking more than 80 hours for veteran players to finish. With that in mind, the expansion’s $35 price tag - in line with the base game - seems fair enough to me.</p>
<p>Even if that price is a bit much for you when Space Age arrives, you’ll be able to download Factorio’s 2.0 update for free when it arrives alongside the expansion. The overhaul will add various new features, from a new fluid system and remote view to improvements to train controls, combinators and worker robot AI.</p>
<p>Both Space Age and update 2.0 will <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/">drop on October 21st</a>, not far off the release estimate Wube gave last year. The devs say the time between now and then will be spent polishing for the launch, with enough time before Christmas to follow up with any necessary bug fixes.</p>

			<p>Today, CAPCOM <a href="https://x.com/exoprimal/status/1809175429737062400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Exoprimal support - at least in terms of new content - is over, around one year after the game's launch. Starting next week, previously released seasonal content will be continuously cycled following a predetermined pattern. Moreover, the previous season passes will return on sale, allowing players to obtain items from all seasons.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Season 1</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 3</strong></td>
<td><strong>Season 4</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>November</span></td>
<td><span>December</span></td>
<td>January</td>
<td>February</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>March</td>
<td>April</td>
<td>May</td>
<td>June</td>

<td>August</td>
<td>September</td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>November</td>
<td>December</td>
<td><span>January</span></td>
<td><span>February</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When Exoprimal re-enters a season, the progression from the previous instance of that season is carried over. Moreover, each Survival Pass: Premium tier is only valid for the corresponding seasons listed above. For example, if a Survival Pass Season 2: Premium Tier is purchased in July, it can only be used in April, August, or December.</p>
<p>Exoprimal will also feature weekly campaigns and routine missions. The latter will only be available once every four weeks, according to the cycle shown in the image below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>CAPCOM clarifies that all content remains available to play, though they do mention that should there be a lack of players, users can take advantage of AI-powered bots to reach the game's ending.</p>
<p>Exoprimal launched in July 2023 to a lukewarm reception. Whereas most recent CAPCOM games got high scores and strong sales, Exoprimal failed on both accounts. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/exoprimal-not-dino-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's 7/10 review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>As I played Exoprimal more during the various betas, I couldn't help but feel that the game needed something more to rise above the competition, and the game's final version hasn't changed my opinion. In short bursts, the multiplayer game by CAPCOM can be fun, but the novelty of killing off hordes of dinosaurs wears off quickly, leaving only a passable experience that most people won't come back to after experiencing the surprisingly interesting story.</em></p>
<p>One thing is for sure - CAPCOM would have been better off resurrecting Dino Crisis, which still has more than a few fans patiently waiting.</p>

It was planned to release in 2003, but numerous delays, production setbacks, and other problems led to the CG film not seeing the light of day until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.awn.com/news/foodfight-animated-feature-auction&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.awn.com/news/foodfight-animated-feature-auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2012 via an insurance company</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/KKMvSGNuGHE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/KKMvSGNuGHE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And what we got was a horrendous mess of product mascots</a></span>—like Mrs. Butterworth and Charlie Tuna—interacting with ugly characters voiced by people like Wayne Brady, Eva Longoria, Hillary Duff, and Charlie Sheen, who plays the main star of the film, a talking dog-human hybrid detective. And, as with many movies from the early 2000s, the plan was to release a tie-in video game alongside the project.</p><p>We’ve long known about the existence of this game but not much beyond that.

The small studio behind the game, Cat Daddy, started working on the project in 2004. The team put  together some playable demos and showed the game off at E3 2006. </p><p>But as time went on, it became clear to the devs that the people working on the film were in way over their heads and were unlikely to finish <em>Foodfight! </em>on schedule.

The studio still exists today. Plus Howe was able to share <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.org/details/foodfight-cat-daddy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.org/details/foodfight-cat-daddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assets from the project online</a></span>. So while we can’t play the unfinished demos, we can at least dig around the tie-in game’s models, music, and other digital bits like video game archeologists. And I guess, <em>Foodfight! </em>(the movie) was released eventually. Okay, maybe it’s not a complete happy ending. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-open-world-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The whole gacha gaming style varies significantly, with Genshin Impact offering an open world for players to explore but others providing instanced gameplay. You’d be forgiven for not grasping Zenless Zone Zero and how its world works. I didn’t at first, either. So, is Zenless Zone Zero open world? Let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-does-zenless-zone-zero-have-an-open-world">Does Zenless Zone Zero Have An Open World?</h2>



<p>After you progress through the relatively short introduction, in which the game teaches you numerous mechanics and systems, you’ll wind up choosing a central character to play as for the overarching story. Here, in the real world outside of Hollows, you can explore a hub zone. It’s a small neighborhood outside the shop, with a newsstand, noodle shop, electronics store, and plenty of NPCs to interact with or ignore.</p>



<p>But as to whether Zenless Zone Zero is an open world or not, no, it’s not. It’s a small hub area, a single street with a few shops and nothing more. </p>







<h2 id="h-are-zenless-zone-zero-battles-open-world">Are Zenless Zone Zero Battles Open World?</h2>



<p>When you’re not busy interacting with characters, scratching lottery tickets, or ordering noodles at the local food stall, you’ll spend time battling monsters within a Hollow in ZZZ. These battles are in an instanced environment, encompassing a few small areas with a handful of enemies before you move on to the next area. Ultimately, you wind up fighting a boss or interacting with a story element, such as tracking down a lost courier.</p>



<p>There is no open-world environment to explore in the game.</p>

<p>While exploring the limited but detailed world, don’t forget to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-get-polychrome-in-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accumulate Polychrome</a> to help on your journey.

                <p>The most common mode of transportation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>is simply walking or running to your destination. While you can also ride a mount, which requires the use of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-a-saddle-in-minecraft/1100-6524656/" data-ref-id="1100-6524656">saddle</a>, these methods are often too slow for eager players who want to get across the map in an instant. Fortunately, there is a way to teleport in Minecraft, but it requires some setup to accomplish.</p><h2>Teleporting in Minecraft</h2><p>First and foremost, teleporting is considered an unofficial act of cheating in Survival or Hardcore worlds. While teleporting won't get you officially banned by Mojang, the mode of transportation does require the use of console commands. If you're in a world by yourself or with some friends, this likely doesn't carry any weight. However, you won't be able to teleport if the admin of a world doesn't allow the use of console commands.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328769" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328769"></a><figcaption>The teleport command offers some presets to help you out</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4328769-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.03-15.50.15.72.png"></figure><p>With that out of the way, you need to enable the use of cheats on whatever world you're trying to play on. This is done by going to the world settings in the main menu and selecting "Allow Cheats: ON." You can do this when setting up a new world, but if you're trying to set up commands on an existing world, you have to follow a different process. In an existing world, press "Esc" or "Options" and then select "Open to LAN." From here, you can enable commands and start a local world.</p><p>Once cheats have been enabled, you can begin teleporting and taking advantage of any other console command in Minecraft. To bring up console commands, press "/" on PC or right D-Pad on controller. From here, type "/tp," which is the basic teleport command. However, you need a physical location to teleport to, which requires coordinates or a specific destination. Just by typing "/tp," the game brings up a list of commands, allowing you to teleport to the nearest player, entity, or recent coordinates.</p><p>If you're on PC, you can hit F3 to show your current coordinates. On console, you can go to Settings and press "Show Coordinates." As long as you have accurate coordinates, you can teleport to anywhere on the Minecraft map. The exact command for teleporting to coordinates is:</p><ul><li>/tp X X X (replace each X with the corresponding coordinate number)</li></ul><p>Another teleport command is "/tp Username," which allows you to teleport to another player's location. All you have to do is replace "Username" with the other player's name and you'll teleport right to them. Here are some other teleport commands to be aware of:</p><ul><li>/tp &lt;location&gt;</li><li>/tp &lt;target&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</li><li>/tp @p (closest player)</li><li>/tp @a (all players)</li></ul>

Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> won't be hit by the same component shortages that blighted the launch of other recent consoles and led to months of product scarcity and scalping. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">said</a> it had now "resolved" the issue which had seen it unable to manufacture enough Switch 1 hardware to meet demand in previous years. Both Sony, with PlayStation, and Microsoft, with Xbox, faced similar shortages for their own parts. 
</p>
<p>
"That situation has now been resolved," Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said of Switch 1 stock. "As for the
successor to Nintendo Switch, at present we do not think shortages of components will significantly affect production."

<p>
Indeed, Nintendo said it felt positive about its ability to launch and supply Switch 2 consoles overall, as it was taking steps to ensure its expected release next year went as smoothly as possible.
</p>
<p>
"We believe that the most important countermeasure against reselling is to produce enough units to meet demand," Furukawa continued. "This thinking has not changed since last year. In addition, we are taking into account circumstances in each region and considering what measures can be taken within
the limits permitted by law."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to formally announce Switch 2 or detail when it will likely arrive, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Eurogamer understands the console is now due in 2025</a>, following earlier plans to launch it in time for Christmas 2024.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, don't expect Switch 1 to get any cheaper, either.
</p>
<p>
"Currently, we cannot provide any information about the launch timing or pricing strategy for the successor system," Furukawa concluded. "In addition, we are not currently considering a price change for Nintendo Switch." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make the announcement of Switch 2</a> before the end of "this fiscal year" - so before 31st March 2025.

            <p>It looks like we won’t get a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> in the style of last year’s excellent do-over of the original limb-shooting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, but it turns out that Dead Space isn’t completely, uh, dead just yet. Though to what degree you could consider it alive and well - reanimated in a twisted form of its previous glory, perhaps - is another question entirely.</p>

<p>EA’s space-horror series is finding its way into the next season of Battlefield 2042, inspiring a new horde-extraction mode called Outbreak that will run from July 9th to 16th as part of the shooter’s seventh - and final - season Turning Point. (The game is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/">90% off over on Steam</a> at the moment ahead of its swan song season.)</p>
<p>The time-limited event doesn’t quite star the The Thing-like necromorphs found aboard Dead Space’s Ishimura space station, opting instead for decidedly more human-like zombies-slash-infected-slash-whatever (presumably to make it easier to shoot them in the head, instead of wondering where their head even is) that will try and overwhelm the players’ squad as they attempt to defeat waves of enemies, buy new gear as they advance and extract from each level without losing their single life.</p>

<p>Don’t expect to find the limb-slicing plasma cutter in your armoury, either, although the teaser trailer for the crossover does show a character decked out in Isaac’s glowing engineer suit and helmet. That’ll join the usual selection of weapon skins, charms, player cards and other cosmetics able to be unlocked through the event itself and bought from the in-game store.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-remake">Dead Space remake</a> developers Motive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-remake-devs-ea-motive-are-building-a-team-to-work-on-future-battlefield-projects">now split between working on Battlefield and developing their Iron Man game</a>, it seems like - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">for whatever reason</a> - we won’t be getting a remake of Dead Space 2 anytime soon. Whether a one-week crossover event with Battlefield is really the brightest sign for the series’ future, I’m not convinced - but I suppose it’s at least acknowledgement that someone, somewhere in EA is thinking about Dead Space, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 has been out for over a decade, but players never got any sort of single-player DLC during its life span. And while we know there <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-leak-dlcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were reportedly plans</a> for up to eight DLCs, one specifically that was centered around Trevor was canceled because of the powerhouse that is GTA Online.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber SanInPlay</a>, former Rockstar developer Joseph Rubino talked about the canceled Trevor DLC for GTA 5 and why it never saw the light of day.</p>



<p>“We split our teams into two, so I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC — which Steven Ogg was a very important part of — and then some of the team overlapped and went to [Red Dead Redemption 2] early on,” Rubino said.</p>



<p>As far as the content of the DLC, Rubino says he believes that a lot of the stuff planned and developed ultimately found its way into GTA Online. He couldn’t recall any specifics of what made it, but believed they did. The DLC itself was supposed to feature Trevor as some sort of undercover agent.</p>

<p>As to why the DLC never happened, Rubino says it had to do with the money that GTA Online was making right off the bat.</p>



<p>“When GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that,” he said. “I think looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, but that was a business decision that they made and I was a little upset about that.”</p>



<p>He added that the development of the content was roughly halfway done before it was shelved.</p>

"Born of red-maned Radagon, and Rennala of the Full Moon. A lion bred for battle."

"They may have cut it because it just wasn't impressive or important enough," they said. "It's very generic dialogue and Radahn never spoke, so him saying something 'meh' might lose the impact.

The game upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 this year. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>“Enterprising Pioneers are tasked with charting and exploiting a vast and diverse alien planet to construct and automate intricate multi-story factories. Players must also defend themselves against hostile alien lifeforms, automate vehicles, and research new technologies to keep improving their constructs.”</blockquote><p>1.0 brings with it “premium plumbing”, which means the HUB’s “once trivial toilet has been updated with an advanced flushing mechanism, providing an extra luxurious worker experience for fans.” Check that out in the trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Satisfactory entered early access in March 2019 and has received eight major updates and hundreds of smaller updates in the years since. The 5.5 million sales figure is the result of a sizeable community that continues to play now, and the 1.0 launch will surely see another jolt of interest.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-1-0-release-date-and-uh-flushable-toilets-revealed.919785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coffee Stain has announced the&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the factory sim is leaving Early Access in just a couple of months, bringing lots of new features as part of its full release.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/4270057097478183701" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>launches in full on September 10th, and perhaps most importantly, you'll finally be able to flush the toilet in the HUB when 1.0 arrives. Your living conditions are about to improve!</p>
<p>If you really need to know about the other features (which, of course, you don't, because flushing toilets are pretty much all any game needs), then you'll be pleased to know there is other stuff coming to&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>for its 1.0 release as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-1.0-release-date-planet.jpg?itok=SuSTCZhs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-1.0-release-date-planet.jpg?itok=APS9SydW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 is launching in just a couple of months.</figcaption></figure><p>Resource nodes have received a major overhaul in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0; a number have been either added, altered, or removed, with the bulk of reductions occurring in the game's Northern Forest zone to encourage players to spread their wings.</p>
<p>Changes have also been made to recipe costs in order to "promote smoother transitions" between recipe tiers, with particular attention being paid to late-game recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look forward to changes to research trees, power generators, and more, as well as technical optimizations across the board. Of course, none of this actually matters, because I've already mentioned the flushing toilets.</p>
<p>Coffee Stain has released a rather tongue-in-cheek trailer to mark the impending arrival of&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0, and you'll never guess what feature it focuses on. Here's the trailer in all its glory.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, it's a factory sim that allows you to build a complex network of machines and "enter conveyor belt heaven", as Coffee Stain puts it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>also offers a touch of combat and exploration alongside its building gameplay, so if you prefer your factory sims with a dash of danger, this is definitely the one to look at.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/goat-simulator-devs-coffee-stain-tease-new-project-satisfactory">revealed in March 2018</a>&nbsp;and was initially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-early-access-release-date-set-for-march-2019">set for an Early Access release in 2019</a>, although it wouldn't actually see the light of day until the following year. Since launch, it's received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-7-brings-blueprints-and-more">blueprints</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-7-brings-blueprints-and-more">biome overhaul</a>, and more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 when it launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>&nbsp;on September 10th, and if you can't wait that long, the Early Access version is available right now.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has referred Apple to the European Commission for rejecting its notarisation submission, alleging Apple's refusal is "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Epic said Apple had taken issue with its call-to-action buttons, claiming both its "Get" and "In-app purchases" buttons are too similar in design to Apple's own buttons.</p>
<p>Epic says it is using the words "install" and "in-app purchases" as this follows naming conventions that app users are already familiar with.</p>

<p>"Apple's rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA, and we've shared our concerns with the European Commission," Epic concluded. "Barring further roadblocks from Apple, we remain ready to launch in the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU in the next couple of months."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-opens-fresh-investigation-into-apple-following-further-non-compliance-claims">EU regulators recently opened a new investigation</a> following claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">Apple is not complying with EU rules</a>.</p>
<p>The European Commission – which started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">investigating Apple's alleged non-compliance</a> back in March – has accused Apple of breaching its Digital Markets Act, meaning Apple could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the firm's global annual revenue. That may not sound like much, but when you consider that Apple generates £301bn ($383bn) a year, that's a sizeable punishment.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">previously-announced solution to satisfy DMA rules has drawn fire</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">fees and limits, which make launching games or apps outside of the App Store costly</a> – something long-time legal rival Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney called "hot garbage".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pledges-action-over-inappropriate-use-of-its-characters-so-players-not-made-to-feel-uncomfortable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has responded to concern over the inappropriate use of its characters online and said it would take "appropriate action" against anything that would make some players "feel uncomfortable".
</p>
<p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">recently</a> questioned by a shareholder who said they had "come across cases on social media where Nintendo IP and games are used inappropriately". This "inappropriate" use of Nintendo's characters "poses the risk of damaging" the company's brand, the question continued - so what was Nintendo planning to do about it?
</p>
<p>
In response, Furukawa said Nintendo's management policy was to "bring smiles through entertainment" (but presumably not the kind of smiles generated by "inappropriate" use). 
</p>

<p>
"I will refrain from commenting on individual cases, but we believe that appropriate action must be taken against any behaviour that undermines this policy," Furukawa continued, without specifying what that action might entail. 
</p>
<p>
"Our goal is to create an environment where everyone can enjoy playing games. We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our consumers are not made to feel uncomfortable, not only in our games but also anywhere they come into contact with our IP."
</p>
<p>
Of course, fans have been using Nintendo characters for "inappropriate" reasons for a very, very long time. The most high-profile example of this in recent memory was a certain Bowsette - a spicy fan mash-up of Peach and Bowser that Nintendo initially <a href="https://www.j-cast.com/2018/09/25339499.html?p=all">refused</a> to comment on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bowsette-is-trending-on-twitter">when it went viral</a> and trended on social media worldwide, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pooh-poohs-bowsette">later ruled as non-canon</a>.
</p>
<p>
Few creators address the use of their characters by fans for less-than-appropriate reasons. Why? Well, I'm reminded of when Ken Levine once asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1o09p2/we_are_ken_levine_iglevine_and_andres_gonzalez/">reddit</a> to stop drawing naughty pictures of Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite. Simply put, it doesn't work. 
</p>
<p>
People will always be horny, especially Nintendo fans. 
</p>
<p>But perhaps it's worth remembering - Nintendo is watching.</p>

        <p>The Viper will become less ‘busy’, with other changes for Astrologian, Black Mage, tanks and more from 7.01</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a>, the latest expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, has officially been out just three days, arriving earlier this week after a brief early access release. Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909">blog post</a> that also dropped the tidbit that Dawntrail’s release saw the MMO reach its highest concurrent player count since the release of base game A Realm Reborn over a decade ago, director Naoki ‘Yoshi-P’ Yoshida detailed various fixes and changes planned for multiple classes from patch 7.01 onward.</p>
<p>The headline changes will tweak the Viper, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-viper-job-is-a-dual-wielding-blademaster-thats-new-to-the-entire-series">dual sword-wielding class introduced in Dawntrail</a>. Players have spent enough time with the new job to raise concerns about its skill rotation being too “busy”, leading to plans to reduce its demand for directional requirements and tweak the effect of various actions. Most of that reduced “busyness” will come in with patch 7.05, Yoshida said, though there’ll be some adjustments to the range of some actions in the next patch.</p>
<p>Dawntrail’s other new job, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-jobs-bring-a-splash-of-splatoon-and-pokemon-to-its-dawntrail-expansion">artistic mage Pictomancer</a>, will instead see a smaller bug fix that solves the issue of effects for the Subtractive Palette, Aetherhues and Aetherhues II being possible to manually disable by players, which will be included in 7.01.</p>
<p>One older job in for some fixes is the Monk, which will look to address what Yoshida called an “inadequate performance” caused by the wrong potencies for some actions and an issue with stacking the Fury status, both accidentally introduced as part of wider changes to core Monk attacks in 7.0 that the producer said “significantly changed how it feels to play the job”. The next patch will help make area-of-effect attacks better again, with “minor adjustments” to the Monk’s HUD as a result.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-krile-pictomancer.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the Astrologian job has apparently received “considerable feedback” from players about being hard to use during damage burst phases of battles, which will be addressed by changing the recast time of Light Speed and making it a charged action, as well as dropping the recast time of the job’s draw actions. Level 90 action Macrocosmos will also see its potency tweaked.</p>
<p>The Samurai will similarly see some recast timers shortened - for Tendo Setsugekka and Tendo Kaeshi Setsugekka, specifically - while the Red Mage will have the effect time of Manafication lengthened. Black Mages struggling to recover MP without the Umbral Soul action should also find it easier from the next patch on, with other attack potencies being adjusted in 7.05.</p>
<p>Tanks as a whole will also be changed, as players have expressed that remaining the target of enemies using Enmity has become difficult due to the high-damage attacks of other jobs, made particularly difficult for Dark Knight and Gunbreaker characters who have seen damage removed from their movement abilities. Those movement abilities will have increased enmity effects added in 7.01, with extra enmity also added to area-of-effect attacks.</p>
<p>The changes will roll out over the next couple of patches, with Yoshida also assuring that “several issues that may have proven a hinderance to your overall experience” aside from the job complaints will also be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, Dawntrail’s rollout seems to have been far smoother than the hours-long queues suffered by previous expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker">Endwalker</a>, in part thanks to some shiny new servers and other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14-braces-for-dawntrail-login-queues-with-plans-to-limit-travel-and-crack-down-on-afk-players">congestion-easing measures</a> put in place ahead of the launch.</p>

            <p>
We never covered the original Nocturnal, an “intense 3-hour-long action-platformer” from Sunnyside Games, but the Steam user reception seems very positive for a pay-upfront game that actively describes itself as three hours long, and the just-announced sequel seems excellently awash with fire, darkness and death. It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In Nocturnal 2, you search the forgotten island city of Ytash for the First Brazier, which very much sounds like an earlygame Souls objective. The 2D levels and art, however, put me in mind of Capybara’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/below">Below</a>, except viewed from a classique Prince of Persia perspective. It’s certainly an atmospheric setting, abundant in pillared doorways and negative space – and a hazardous one, especially when you can’t see the nameless things you’re fighting.
</p>
<p>
“Keeping your Flame alight is your only way to survive the many dangers ahead,” instructs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/">the Nocturnal 2 Steam page</a>. “Maintain it at any cost by striking fire sources and protect it to better see the enemy attacks.” You will find that your incendiary attacks are all the more potent when performed against aerial foes. “Master your flames to hurl enemies and juggle them into ashes,” the Steam page goes on. I’m not sure that’s how thermodynamics works, but I’d be a fool to complain. There are also fire gems you can mix and match to unlock spells.
</p>
<p>
A single playthrough may not take you much longer than the original Nocturnal – which, frankly, now looks like a prototype for this game – but you’ll want to complete it several times to discover everything. “Nocturnal 2 is meant to be consumed in a relatively short amount of time, but many surprises are on the menu for those who seek different paths…and true revelations,” the Steam page concludes. I hope those are genuinely revelatory revelations and not, for example, unlockable wallpapers. Nocturnal 2 will be lighting up screens in 2025. If you like the sound of the original, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634080/Nocturnal_Enhanced_Edition/">60% off till 11th July</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-were-all-spending-our-last-tenner-on-the-best-deals-in-the-steam-summer-sale">the latest Steam summer sale</a>.

            <p>Early 2022 was a glorious time to be on Twitter. I mean, obviously it wasn’t, but it was still <em>named</em> Twitter. That’s something, right? May accelerated absurdity re-contextualise all your hells as, like, still hells but with air conditioning. It was February that year when Gearbox writer Sam Winkler done a funny tweet about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Here’s the tweet:</p>
 <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Souls revolutionized games, in the sense that instead of a story now you can just have some guy with a big sword named Myrmidon of Loss who gasps “Zanzibart… forgive me” when he dies and then twenty YouTubers will make an hour long video about how deep your lore is</p>— Sam Winkler (@ThatSamWinkler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1490070305859162113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The tweet got a lot of attention because it was very funny, and also because a lot of people are very sensitive about Dark Souls and think they’re very clever for understanding what environmental storytelling is, and got unnecessarily mad about it. Much mirth and soapstone clutching followed, Twitter moved on, a twat spent billions of dollars on it so he could stop HardDrive sharing that picture of him and Ghislaine Maxwell, world kept turning.</p>
<p>But! After encountering a hidden boss in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, it occurred to me there’s a small chance that someone at FromSoft - or maybe the localisation team - may have seen that tweet, and decided to have a little fun of their own. <strong>Big large spoilers</strong> ahead, obviously.</p>
<p>So, after finding your way past a maze of elevators and invisible walls, and probably an ulcerated tree spirit or two let's be honest, you’ll arrive in a large secret area named the Abyssal Woods. Deeper on in the woods, you’ll find one of the best mini-dungeons in the game, capped off by a boss. You can check out the fight below - courtesy of 'tuber Shirrako - but you only really need to watch the intro cutscene.</p> <figure>

<p>“I ask you forgive me, dearest Nanaya,” Midra sadly croaks in one of his very few dialogue lines, in a vague lament oddly reminiscent of Winkler’s tweet. Yes, yes, pass the back-putting-out-boluses for my incredible reach, but I’m still putting the chances of this being a cheeky wink at non-zero. Although Nanaya’s quite an easy NPC to learn about, to be fair, since you’ll find some items related to them on the path to Midra.</p>
<p>Still, even if it’s nothing, I’m glad to be reminded of one of my favourite gently mocking FromSoft tweets, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/8o8t19/me_irl/">alongside this classic</a>. Although I would posit that Big Hat Logan’s presence as comic relief actually contrasts against the prevailing mood of Lordran, further drawing out its mysterious and evocative qualities. Furthermore….</p>

Keep in mind you'll need to transfer PS5 or Xbox Series X games from this external drive to your console before you can play them--Xbox One or PS4 games can be played directly from the drive--so this probably isn't the best solution for console gaming. Instead, use it to store your biggest PC games as well as other data.</p><p>Oddly enough, this Starfield-inspired HDD is cheaper than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-External-Desktop/dp/B08Y1Q7G1Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard 8TB Seagate Game Drive</a>.
