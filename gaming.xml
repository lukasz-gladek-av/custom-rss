            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has already shown off Donkey Kong Bananza as one of its biggest early exclusives. But Nintendo Korea looks to have dropped a clanger regarding a major character spoiler in the game.</p>



<p>Firstly, if the title hasn’t given this away already—<strong>there is a Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler here</strong>. If you read on, you know what you’re getting yourself into. But we have to make this declaration, as Nintendo Korea’s website apparently (and prematurely) went early with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DK Bananza</a> graphic.</p>



<p>In it, we see the return of a popular and legendary DK character. The news is sure to be <em>apeeling </em>to many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-5-donkey-kong-appearances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong</a> Bananza-wanting fans.</p>



<p><strong>This is your final spoiler warning.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-korea-spoils-donkey-kong-bananza-character-return">Nintendo Korea Spoils Donkey Kong Bananza Character Return</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Seems sus to us. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nintendo Korea website originally had a Donkey Kong Bananza graphic featuring a younger-looking <strong>Pauline</strong>—the legendary DK damsel in distress. The graphic has since been swapped—as you can see in our before and after image above—but thanks to this <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-koreas-website-seems-to-spoil-a-huge-detail-about-donkey-kong-bananza.1156071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra post</a>, the original evidence can still be seen.</p>



<p>Pauline has featured prominently throughout the annals of Donkey Kong history. She first appeared in the original 1981 debut of Donkey Kong, has since taken up a recurring role in countless Donkey Kong games (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong vs. Mario</a>), and has been a playable character in Super Smash Bros. and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> franchises.</p>



<p>She looks unmistakably younger here, though. This leads fans to wonder if this is a prequel or if new character Odd Rock is connected to her. We look forward to finding out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is an all-new project from Bungie that’s set to act as a reboot of sorts to a game released in the 1990s. In the earliest materials released by the decades-old developer, we’ve been given snippets of a shooter that’s colourful and intriguing, but what’s the core premise here? Is Marathon an extraction shooter?</p>



<p>The extraction shooter genre is a tough one to break into, given how a few titles dominate the space. If Marathon is an extraction shooter, how well will it fare against the competition?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>







<p><strong>Marathon is a traditional PvP extraction shooter with sci-fi vibes and cybernetic mercenaries.</strong> The core gameplay loop will see players accept a series of quests, gear up, load into one of three maps, and then attempt to extract successfully, all while fighting other players and digging up loot.</p>



<p>That’s as simple as the extraction shooter loop gets, but the kicker with Marathon is the setting.</p>



<p>It’s set in and around a ‘lost colony’ on Tau Ceti IV, a planet <strong>far </strong>from our own. Players will control ‘Runners’, cybernetic characters that are little more than soldiers of fortune. They’re in it for riches and rewards, and each raid into the world of Marathon is an opportunity to seize valuable loot and claim the gear of other players.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-multiplayer">Is Marathon Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Marathon is a multiplayer game with a PvP model, which is typical for the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>It’s a survival title, and as it’s an extraction shooter, you can bet your last dollar it’s tougher than your average shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has the top spot in the genre, and that’s one of the most punishing games ever made, so take that on board.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-loot-work-in-marathon">How Does Loot Work in Marathon?</h2>



<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/">exclusive Marathon gameplay details</a>, breaking down how loot works in the game.</p>



<p>We revealed that loot is split up into three categories: loot, implants, and perks.</p>



<p>Players can unlock various items as they play, using implants to augment their character and perks to acquire new skills and abilities. It was also suggested by sources that Marathon will have a permadeath feature in some capacity, which could mean that each death in the game could come with catastrophic consequences.</p>

            <p>Japanese game stocks have dropped following the announcement of major tariffs on trade to the US.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs last week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>

<p>We are now seeing some of the impact these tariffs will have on companies. As shared by industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, on Monday morning at 10am Japan time, Nintendo's stock was down by 7.35 percent. Meanwhile, Sony has seen a drop of 10.16 percent, Bandai Namco -7.03 percent, Konami -3.93 percent, Sega -6.57 percent, Koei Tecmo -5.83 percent, Capcom -7.13 percent, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> -5.23 percent.</p>
<p>"The mobile game companies do even worse," Toto wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>

<p>Back in February, Sony took some preventative measures to protect itself from the then impending tariffs, which included stockpiling PlayStation 5's in the US. This will provide the PS5 maker a "temporary buffer against the impact of tariffs," Ahmad wrote over the weekend. However, as Ahmad notes, Sony's business is wider reaching than just its PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>As for the PS5, "Sony would need to assess how quickly it can move production of US units to Japan (lower tariff rate: 24 percent) and how many would be produced in China (higher tariff rate: 54 percent), and how quickly it can start producing in Vietnam (Est 2026)," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1908641169795674564">Ahmad wrote on X</a>.</p>
<p>"The firm would then need to evaluate how these tariffs impact current profit margins and how much they would need to increase hardware prices for the consumer. There could also be a potential impact on accessories and game pricing depending on how Sony wants to pass on costs."</p>
<p>Ahmad continued: "The good news is that the initial stockpiling + Japan manufacturing + PS5 being mid to late gen at this point (profitable on per unit basis) + <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> likely priced at $700 in anticipation of some potential tariff impact, means that even with a price increase, the increase may not be as significant as it would be for new tech products.</p>
<p>"However, there is still so much uncertainty around tariffs at this point, which won't actually go into effect until April 9, that no one knows if tariffs will end up higher, lower or removed entirely at some point."</p>

<p>Last week, Nintendo announced it was making the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States</a>. The company cited the impact of Trump's tariffs as well as "evolving market conditions" as the reason for this delay.</p>
<p>Nintendo still expects to release its Switch successor on 5th June in the US, as originally planned.</p>
<p>For more on the console, our Tom has already been hands-on with the Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/bungies-marathon-reveal-is-coming-on-saturday-12th-april/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> gameplay reveal will take place on 12th April, after their fans managed to complete an ARG to reveal the date of the reveal. Could you imagine if they hadn’t managed it in time?</p>
<p>Streaming at 6PM UK time / 7PM CEST / 1PM ET / 10AM PT, Bungie’s developers will debut Marathon gameplay alongside news and updates for the game. Here’s a teaser trailer with a pink robot cat in it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first new project from Bungie since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny</a>, Marathon is a PvPvE team-based extraction shooter set on the planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players will inhabit the bodies of cybernetic mercenaries known as Runners who can survive the planet’s harsh environment while searching the abandoned colony and surrounding planet for loot, including new weapons and gear.</p>
<p>It takes what feels like rather loose inspiration from Bungie’s 1994 FPS, Marathon, an early counterpart to Doom that was a Mac exclusive before spreading to PC with its sequel. The first game was set aboard a colony ship that was under attack by the S’pht and Pfhor alien races, while the ship’s AI gained sentience through a process known as Rampancy – a theme that carried forward to the Halo series. The sequels jetted across to other planets in the universe, delving into time travel and alternate realities.</p>

<p>But don’t expect that story to be told through this new game in anywhere near the same way – you can, at least, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/11/classic-marathon-free-steam/">play the originals for free</a>. Speaking back at the game’s reveal in 2023, Game Director Christopher Barrett said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Marathon is designed from the start as a PvP-focused game and won’t have a single-player campaign. Instead, with the PvP experience as our foundation, we’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

            <p>Bungie have released a trailer for a trailer for extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>. Last week the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-gearing-up-to-reveal-something-about-marathon">teased the possibility of an announcement</a> with some cryptic tweets. The alien code was garbled but the message was clear: some substantial news about the upcoming FPS would likely be shared soon. We've still not heard that news, really. But now we at least know when it's coming, thanks to the teasey video of an off-screen gunfight featuring a pink cyborg cat. It is a visual missive for impatient fans: sit down and wait until this weekend.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A more thorough "gameplay reveal" will happen on Sat April 12th, at 6pm BST (that's 10am PDT for US folk), according to the text splashed on-screen at the end of this short video.</p>

<p>No idea what the cat is all about. Is this a cyber-critter who follows you about in-battle looking for scraps, or is it just a cute marketing mascot to earn easy love from animal lovers? Will you be able to pet this cat, or do you use it as a grenade? We'll know more this Saturday.</p>
<p>Bungie have been relatively quiet about Marathon since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">its reveal in 2023</a>. We know it's an extraction shooter with a PvP focus, and that it'll be set in the same universe as the Marathon games of the 1990s. But it's not a direct sequel or remake in the traditional sense. Fights will take place on the planet of Tau Ceti IV, and judging by the glitchy aesthetic, the rampant AI nemeses of the originals will doubtlessly come into play somehow. If you're deeply curious about the lore and background, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon Trilogy is free on Steam</a>. </p>
<p>The development of nu-Marathon has been troubled. Director Joe Ziegler reassured fans last October that work on the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">was ongoing</a>, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs at the studio</a> and the ousting of the game's previous director, Christopher Barrett, for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">allegations of misconduct</a> (a decision Barrett <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">has sued Sony over</a>). Bungie undoubtedly have stacks of faithful fans for whom <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has offered years of shooty distraction, but they're now facing a much more difficult-to-crack live service environment, and a publisher that has no qualms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">eating their young</a>. In other words, the pressure is on for Marathon to be something more interesting than just another extraction shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-already-selling-for-enormous-amounts-on-ebay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many gamers are experiencing a serious case of FOMO over the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch successor has already been taking pre-orders across the UK, and sellers are listing their pre-orders to make amazing profits on eBay.</p>



<p>Most people want the latest and greatest items. This appears to be the case for Nintendo’s recently shown-off Switch 2. The epic console has been given a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and we’ve also got an insight into the cost of its games. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console’s price</a> tag was a talking point after the Direct 2 Showcase.</p>



<p>Whatever you think of the Nintendo Switch 2’s price, it’s nothing compared to how much people are prepared to pay for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-already-live-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK pre-order</a> on eBay.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-buy-a-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-on-ebay-for-lots-of-money">You Can Buy a Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order on eBay For Lots of Money</h2>



<figure><figcaption>At least they’ll get to play. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the UK, you can grab a Switch 2 console on its own for £395.99 or £429.99 if bundled with a digital copy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. This is much more than the OG Switch, but it’s not surprising given the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new features</a>.</p>



<p>However, if you’ve been unable to secure a pre-order, you can battle it out with other <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;LH_Complete=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eBay</a> buyers who are spending over £600 for pre-orders! Completed sales of Switch 2 pre-orders range from anywhere between about <strong>£450 to £600 plus</strong>.</p>



<p>The most expensive one I’ve seen is for <strong>£628.92</strong>—with Mario Kart World included. Even still, this is <strong>£198.93</strong> over the original price. </p>



<p>We’re not here to tell anyone how much they should and shouldn’t want a Switch 2. This is simply a cautionary message that if you’re seeking a Switch 2 pre-order through eBay, you’ll need to pay way over the odds.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IG Forum</a> and let us know what you think. Is the Switch 2 worth this much? Or are you better off waiting if you don’t have a pre-order secured?</p>

		<p>Neon Abyss 2 is filled with cyberpunk vibes, absurd over-the-top weapons, and some of the most modern and disquieting takes on gods going. It’s a vibrant nightmare of a roguelike with plenty of style and flair, but it also feels incredibly reminiscent of the first game. That’s obviously not a bad thing – why fix what isn’t broken? – and fans of the first game will already have this on their wish lists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re once again thrown into the bright dystopia that has you fighting for your life after you drop out of a bar into the underworld. The general formula is much the same as it was before. That means you’ll be running around shooting things, trying to survive in different areas and gathering different currencies to then spend in shops and on upgrades. This doesn’t feel meaningfully different than the first game, but, to be fair, the first game felt very solid in this respect, so that’s fine.</p>


<p>Where the game does differ is in some of its general progression. The new Faith system basically lets you unlock special rooms as you’re playing that can have a variety of effects. Sometimes that means you’ll be able to gamble a lot of money to get fancy new items, sometimes it’ll be crafting, and sometimes it’ll just be an artifact of some kind. It makes it worth trying to play a little bit differently as you go, but you can often just sort of power through if you want as well.</p>


<p>The weapons feel better and more worthwhile now as well. Weapons have levels, with new ones often being higher level. However, if you decide to stick to the weapon you’ve fallen in love with, such as the gun that turns your eggs into a big old dragon to attack enemies with, then you can choose to stay faithful to it. If you do that, you can gain experience for the weapon to actually level it up, and when you do so you’ll get a reward. It’s a fun extra wrinkle in trying to decide what weapon to use.</p>
<p>There are some excellent choices now as well. Even the standard weapon fires a laser shot every so often, but you can get gloves that send out mighty long-range punches, weapons that convert your grenades into rockets, and a wide range of melee weapons that can slash through space. &nbsp;It’s pretty hard to argue with a katana that can cut through space and time, you know?</p>

<p>All-in-all, Neon Abyss 2 already feels very slick. A lot of the value of these kinds of roguelikes is hidden behind layers of secrets and unlocks though, so while I enjoyed my time with the preview build, I want to get my hands on the full version before settling into my thoughts on the game. For those who loved the first game and just want more though, you’ll be getting plenty of that with this follow-up, and you’re sure to enjoy some of the new systems and weapons as well. At least you don’t have too long to wait on that front.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-gaming-companies%E2%80%99-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs.1156893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/japanese-gaming-companies-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The burden of the US tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump is taking a heavy toll on the shares of Japanese gaming companies today. Sony was hit the hardest, losing just over 10% of its market value in a single session. Nintendo isn't far off, losing 7.85% today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Big N is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. Pre-orders were supposed to go live on Wednesday, April 9; however, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> in the United States precisely because of the aforementioned tariffs, and now users fear the console and its accessories might get even pricier. Needless to say, investors aren't keen on the impact this might have on the console's success, either.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo, known for Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, and Atelier among others, is losing 7.63%. Bandai Namco, publisher of franchises like Ace Combat, Dark Souls, Dragon Ball, and Tekken just to name a few, is losing 7.37%. SEGA Sammy, the legendary publisher of franchises like Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, Like a Dragon, Sonic, and Total War, is close by with -7.29%. CAPCOM, another revered Japanese gaming company (Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, etc.), loses 6.61%. Square Enix (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean) loses 5.62%. Lastly, KONAMI is currently down 'only' 5.19%. The latter company has relied less on videogaming for some time, although that is changing rapidly with the revival of beloved franchises such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the tariffs will probably hit Western game companies just as hard as they are doing with Japanese ones. However, due to the timezone, this is the first glimpse we have at how the industry (which is already ailing due to increased budgets and stifled growth) is reacting to the application of the US tariffs. It's not looking good, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashton Hall, the viral personality behind the sensational ‘morning routine’ videos, has uploaded a new clip comparing his life in 2018 to 2025. It can be interpreted as a veiled bag on gaming – in the 2018 segment, he’s playing games multiple times a day and raging at cutscenes on Grand Theft Auto 5, for some reason.</p>



<p>However, when he hangs up the controller (which was never even switched on), he becomes a new man, waking up at 3 AM and plunging his face into ice bowls before making thousands of dollars in the blink of an eye.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plot-holes">Plot Holes</h2>



<p>Ashton Hall has become a phenomenally successful creator following the viral trend around his morning routine videos. In the clips he has uploaded across social media, Hall has shown what his daily routine looks like, revealing a morning schedule that unfolds over several hours, prompting parodies worldwide.</p>



<div><article><p><span>2018 vs. 2025. First 4 hours will change everything ⏰</span></p></article></div>







<p>In his latest video uploaded to Twitter, Hall shows himself ‘in 2018’, playing video games in a dinky apartment, relying on snack foods and carbonated beverages for sustenance, and doom-scrolling on social media.</p>



<p>He becomes enraged at a cutscene on Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4, throwing a controller that was never even powered on at the television, shattering it on impact. Later, he’s seen playing the same game on the same television set, so I’m not sure what to believe at this point.</p>



<p>His classic skewed timelines are also front and centre – it takes him 12 minutes to power on the controller after picking it up from a nightstand.</p>



<p>But it’s okay because after ditching the video games, Hall became a much better man with a regimented morning schedule that involves rubbing bananas on his face and spending four minutes suspended in mid-air over a swimming pool, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Generational run, indeed.</p>

            <p>Bungie will finally reveal details of its next game, Marathon, later this week.</p>
<p>The Destiny maker released a teaser video for a Marathon Gameplay Reveal, which will take place on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/MARATHONTHEGAME">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarathonTheGame">YouTube</a> on 12th April at 6pm UK time (10am PDT).</p>
<p>The teaser itself shows a character running through a bright jungle chased by some sort of robot or mech, though we don't see a full shot of either. We do, however, see an adorable pink cat curl up next to the (presumably dying) figure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Bungie first announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>The original Marathon first-person shooter was released in 1994 and received two sequels. Now, Bungie is reviving the series as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that's set in the same universe as the original games.</p>
<p>Marathon will be the first new project from Bungie since Halo and Destiny, set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV where players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries Runners.</p>
<p>It's aiming for release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Marathon game was released on Steam for free</a>.</p>
<p>Then in October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">Marathon game director Joe Ziegler gave an update to explain the gameplay loop</a> but stated it was too early to show gameplay and more would be shown next year.</p>
<p>Now it's next year and, true to its word, Bungie is finally set to show off the game in action.</p>
<p>News of the game has been tainted by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">dismissal of former project lead Chris Barrett</a> following alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Switch 2 listings have popped up on the likes of eBay, as retailers run out of stock following pre-orders going live.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo gave us all a much closer look at its upcoming Switch successor. Along with an overview of games and such, it also gave us a release date and retail price - Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>However, once pre-orders went live, stock soon ran out, with places such as Argos already out of stock. "Sorry, this item is just too popular! But we may get more stock, so do check back at a later date," reads a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickPR=plp:1:9">notice on Argos' website</a>.</p>

<p>And, as to be expected, given this high demand, listings for the Switch 2 are now popping up on eBay, above that recommended retail price. At the time of writing, there are multiple Switch 2 listings via the online auction site in excess of £600.</p>
<p>On the completed sales side of things, one Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle was sold for £634.02, which is £204.03 more than the recommended retail price. A Switch 2 console without Mario Kart World included, meanwhile, has sold for £554.45.</p>
<p>While retailers such as Argos and Smyths have opened pre-orders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping by implementing an invite-only system. Emails have started going out for those fortunate to be selected.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>

Like many fresh ideas, the concept of a deck-building game is startling in its simplicity. Card games where you build a custom deck before you play have been around a while. In a deck-building game, though, you build the deck <em>while </em>you play. Starting with a hand of currency cards, you cash them in for other, more interesting cards, and make a deck on-the-fly you think is good enough to win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't just gamers who got bowled over by the brilliance of the concept: It was designers, too. Gaming was soon awash in copycat games, many of limited interest. Since then, the mechanic has seen redeployment into other genres of game with mixed results, but there are loads of awesome examples. These are the best deck-building board games out there right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR: The Best Deck-Building Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#slaythespire">Slay the Spire</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#heat">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#star-wars">Star Wars: The Deck-Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dune">Dune: Imperium</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#cubitos">Cubitos</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#dominion">Dominion</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#aeons-end">Aeon's End</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games#clank">Clank!

So it's entirely appropriate that there's now a board game version of that game to close the circle. Rules-wise it's very close to its source material as you choose an adventurer and refine their combat deck through a series of tough encounters and merchant visits, climbing the titular spire to fight a terrifying boss. However the parent game is solo only, and a lot of the fun in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slay-the-spire-the-board-game-review">Slay the Spire: The Board Game</a> comes from the fact that you get to venture into the unknown and battle the gribblies with friends along for the ride.</p></div><p id="heat-pedal-to-the-metal"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Heat: Pedal to the Metal">Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h2></p><div catalogid="b34c3d5f-862d-4b67-ae09-2df14512bd66" id="195818"><div id="195818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Heat: Pedal to the Metal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Heat: Pedal to the Metal, your deck represents the engine of your car, with most cards showing a number of spaces to move. On your turn you can switch gears and then must play the corresponding gear number of cards from your hand, trying to avoid taking corners too fast and spinning off, in a nail-biting race to the finish on your choice of included tracks. Deck building in the basic game is limited to managing heat cards that you take in exchange for extra actions but which clog up your deck, however there's an advanced variant that lets you tinker with your engine deck in all sorts of other satisfying ways for a deeper strategic experience.</p></div><p id="lost-ruins-of-arnak"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lost Ruins of Arnak" id="arnak">Lost Ruins of Arnak</h2></p><div catalogid="12b47414-1a47-426c-9d08-c534eb78cc53" id="180361"><div id="180361" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lost Ruins of Arnak</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph" id="star-wars">Given the ongoing popularity of the Indiana Jones series, it's perhaps surprising that more board games haven't riffed on the adventurous archeaologist, but at least this one that does is an absolute cracker. Players race to gather equipment and companions to make expeditions deeper and deeper into the jungle, braving strange guardians and plundering ruins before feeding their gains back into the next expedition in a cool interplay of daring and forward-planning that's surprisingly strategic once you peel back its interlocking mechanics. One of those is your trusty deck of cards that you'll get to add to by spending your loot, before playing as you plan and execute your expeditions.</p></div><p id="star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game" id="star-wars">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h2></p><div catalogid="def0fa37-840a-4faa-9a9a-34e7e08852fd" id="177415"><div id="177415" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At first sight, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-deckbuilding-game-review">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a> looks like a typical example of the genre where you start with a few cards that give you resources, which you spend to buy more cards to beef up your deck. In this instance, you’re looking for offensive cards that damage your opponent’s base as a route to victory. But there are some really fun tweaks to the formula beyond the appealing theme. For starters, you can attack cards before your opponent buys them, denying them good options and earning you a reward. There’s also a very deep well of card variety, with tons of interesting combos between their effects you can explore. Finally, destroying one base isn’t enough: you need three, and you get to pick which ones you use, with their special effects adding another layer to the game’s strategy.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune Imperium" id="dune">Dune Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="78ef26ef-33d1-4276-b2fd-590cf3dddef9" id="155275"><div id="155275" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium</a> your deck represents resources that your noble house can draw on as you seek power and influence in the universe of Frank Herbert’s sci-fi epic. It’s married to another classic mechanic, worker placement, as each card play sends one of your agents to a board space, either courting influence with a faction like The Guild or The Fremen, or to the planet’s surface, to harvest spice or do battle for territory. It’s a clever melange of thematic and abstract concepts that mesh to create a fascinating whole with many parts to master. There’s also a whole new concept for deckbuilding called reveal turns where you discard your remaining cards to get a secondary effect, meaning you’re building and playing your deck on two different levels at once.</p></div><p id="the-quest-for-el-dorado"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quest for El Dorado" id="el-dorado">The Quest for El Dorado</h2></p><div catalogid="a4337eee-9d52-427c-b50e-2db0194e4867" id="198605"><div id="198605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quest for El Dorado</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is what you get when Reiner Knizia, possibly the most prolific and talented game designer of all time, turns his considerable skills onto deck-building. The result is a seamless blend of deck management and race game as players compete to be the first to make it across the map, matching cards from their deck to terrain hexes on the board in order to move. But of course that’s only half the story: there are hidden surprises in many spaces to upend your strategy and powerful one-shot cards in the market that can make or break your game if timed correctly. Easy to learn, fun to play, but full of interaction and challenge: all the hallmarks of yet another Knizia classic that’s worth its weight in gold.</p></div><p id="cubitos"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cubitos" id="cubitos">Cubitos</h2></p><div catalogid="52477445-7671-4979-b7a1-7265ba9a1593" id="198606"><div id="198606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cubitos</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Dominion spawned the whole deck-building subgenre, various games have switched from a deck to a bag of cubes, but Cubitos<em> </em>takes things one step further and allows you to build a collection of actual dice. Your aim is to propel a running racer across the finish line first, but it’s the dice that do the propulsion when you roll the appropriate symbols to move. Other symbols let you buy more dice, thin your collection, even attack and defend with other players. But best of all are the blank faces, which do nothing except let you re-roll them unless you roll all blanks, in which case it’s turn over. With the thrill of rolling huge buckets of dice, the strategy of combining dice types to suit the action, and the addictive terror of push your luck, you’ll be winning with Cubitos even when you lose.</p></div><p id="the-quacks-of-quedlinburg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Quacks of Quedlinburg" id="quedlinburg">The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h2></p><div catalogid="17284768-0988-43e6-bfce-b1a1d8b45546" id="157129"><div id="157129" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each turn of this game (which you may also find re-branded as just plain Quacks), you’ll get the opportunity to add new ingredients to your secret bag, from which you’ll then draw counters to mix in your cauldron in a quest to create the most powerful potion. But watch out: Draw too many bomb counters and your mixture for the round will explode, ending your turn early. This simple premise is set into flight by the fact that you can change the effects of the other counters each game, choosing from a palette of different abilities that dovetail in new and interesting ways, adding more power to your potion and your purchasing ability as you race with your opponents to make the best brew. Add in a slew of other strategic levers to manage, and you’ve got the makings of a modern classic. And once you've mastered the contents of the base game there are all sorts of expansions to mix in, as we explain in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide">Quacks of Quedlinburg buyer's guide</a>.</p></div><p id="tyrants-of-the-underdark"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tyrants of the Underdark" id="underdark">Tyrants of the Underdark</h2></p><div catalogid="54095bdc-7b22-49e7-9e3b-df59a14ac86c" id="155296"><div id="155296" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tyrants of the Underdark</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tyrants-of-the-underdark-board-game-review">Tyrants of the Underdark</a> is another game where your deck corresponds to assets belonging to a noble house, only this time they’re minions in the employ of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ fiendish dark elves. Card play spreads your troops, assassins and influence from your starting city over a network of Underdark locations from the well-known fantasy novel trilogy <a href="https://zdcs.link/MgPPg?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Drizzt</a>. There’s a real sense of struggle as you tussle for territory with other players, card and counter-card adding and removing pieces from the board. Many of the cards represent iconic characters and monsters from the role-playing game with art to match. And there are multiple card sets to combine for new and interesting strategic and tactical options with every play. </p></div><p id="legendary-a-marvel-deck-building-ga"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Ga" id="legendary">Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h2></p><div catalogid="ba64de19-1607-413b-9d01-11cb5d637c32" id="164693"><div id="164693" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary does a couple of interesting things with the deck-building formula. For starters, it’s cooperative, with all the players working together to defeat a supervillain, although if you defeat them you can tally points and declare a top, legendary, player. Second, the villain has a deck too, which functions as a game engine and a scenario which dictates the win and loss conditions. You’re not, as you might expect, playing as individual Marvel heroes but rather controlling them as a group with your card plays, recruiting new cards and attacking the villain’s henchmen. It’s a riot of replayability with so many different combinations out of the box, plus it’s fast and smooth with lots of options to fine-tune the challenge level to your group’s needs. There’s a whole series of Legendary games built on the same mechanical engine, including the excellent <a href="https://zdcs.link/kv00W?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game</a>.</p></div><p id="dominion-2nd-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion: 2nd Edition" id="dominion">Dominion: 2nd Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="912e22f5-6a33-452d-bf80-12fd40392a7a" id="198818"><div id="198818" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion: 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Or you could start with the deck building game that started it all. Dominion wasn't only novel: It was also simple, with quick, three-step turns. All the complexity is on the cards themselves. The goal is to use the starting copper cards to buy better cards, allowing for more money and actions, working up to buying victory point cards. Strategy comes down to honing your deck into the leanest card-buying machine you can manage. With 25 card options, of which 10 got chosen for use in each game, it also has impressive replay value. Yet it's popular enough to have spawned a slew of expansions, of which <a href="https://zdcs.link/vwMMb?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dominion: Intrigue</a> is often considered the best, but we have a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dominion-buying-guide-expansions">Dominion buyer's guide</a> if you want to shop around.</p></div><p id="aeons-end"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Aeon's End" id="aeons-end">Aeon's End</h2></p><div catalogid="c4e046c8-ff49-43e8-bfd5-9b9ba7fd94d9" id="201955"><div id="201955" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aeon's End</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aeon's End takes deck-building into the popular category of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative games</a>. It's a smart move: deck-based games are often low on interaction, and having players work together is a solid solution. Here, you're all wizards working together to save a fantasy city from a marauding evil. And there are plenty of cards to heal and buff your fellow players, so there's plenty to think about. Its particular genius, though, is that you flip your discard pile over rather than shuffling when it's empty. This makes the order of card play critical, allowing you to set up combos for the next time you run through your deck. With other timing-based innovations and a tense random turn order, it's thrilling and challenging in equal measure. You can now choose from a variety of sets as we run down in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aeons-end-board-game-buying-guide">Aeon's End buyer's guide</a>, from facing off against demons in the original box to taking on the undead in a longer, more complex campaign with the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/VxPPY?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legacy of Gravehold</a>.</p></div><p id="clank-catacombs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Clank!

Catacombs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Numbers are at the heart of what makes deck-building work, and they're at the heart of what makes the Clank! series special. Players are adventurers seeking to loot a dungeon and escape before a dragon wakes up. The engine of each hero is their deck, which lets them move and fight, open doors and spend gold. These are just abstract numbers that you use to overcome challenges: The real game is the frantic race in and out of the dungeon. That's where all the themes and thrills are. By separating the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> from the theme, Clank! manages to satisfy fans of both camps with a winning combination. Clank! Catacombs is the latest and greatest iteration of this series, adding more deck control, more variety and a dungeon built of randomly-drawn tiles to re-create the thrill of exploring the unknown. </p></div><p id="undaunted-normandy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Undaunted: Normandy" id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy</h2></p><div catalogid="f73d6c06-70d4-4669-8a3a-3e6e0df5d169" id="158884"><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building has proved a surprising proxy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">warfare</a> in several games. Undaunted is the best of them, using the flow of cards from your deck as a way to simulate casualties and command confusion on the battlefield. It's a great fit, giving players a real sense of running an infantry platoon from simple rules. Atop the deck-building strategy, there's the extra dimension of moving pieces on the map. This isn't so realistic, but it's still a ton of fun as you tussle over tiles using tactics and dice. A selection of scenarios and troop types ensures there's plenty of replay puzzling as you work the game's layers to gain the upper hand. There are multiple editions of the game to choose from. <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ly1rZ?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: Normandy</a> focuses on squad-level combat in France while <a href="https://zdcs.link/pPb1R?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Undaunted: North Africa</a> moves the action to single-soldier special forces and adds rules for vehicles, and for those who'd prefer to avoid the military theme <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review">Undaunted 2200: Callisto</a> is set in a far-future mining colony.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Deck-Building vs Deckbuilding</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck-building is a confusing term because it applies to both a genre and a gaming activity, and it means slightly different things in each case. The term originates in collectible card games, the best known of which is Magic: The Gathering. In this realm, deck-building means the process of deciding what cards from your collection you’re going to use in a deck with which to play the game. In the very earliest days of collectible games, before access to the internet was widespread, this was a key part of the strategic appeal of these titles as you had to decide which cards would work well together. Nowadays, it’s increasingly common for players to get deck-building suggestions from the internet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2008 there was a minor revolution in game design with Dominion, which invented deck-building as a genre. It took inspiration from deck-building as an activity but instead of building a deck before you play from a collection, in these games you build your deck while you play, from a market of cards. In many such games, like Dominion itself or Star Wars The Deckbuilding Game, your starting cards include currencies with which to buy new cards. It’s increasingly common to link deck-building to other game mechanics, as Dune: Imperium does, in which case the resource to buy cards may come from one of those other game elements. Either way you’ll get more and more powerful cards as the game progresses and, often, there will be ways to get rid of your weaker starting cards, too, linking the strategy and tactics of deck construction in new and interesting ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of deck-building in both senses, you might also want to check out <a href="https://zdcs.link/8BVZ8?object_uuid=aaf7ba4e-1b6f-4b88-85fa-863291be3836&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Millennium Blades</a>, which uses the deck-building genre to simulate the process of building a collectible card game collection and using it to build decks. It works surprisingly well, is full of fun pop culture references, and features literal wads of paper money to spend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like these, be sure to check out of picks for the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals">best board game deals</a>.

<p>Schedule 1 is taking the world by storm, topping the charts on Steam and pulling in hundreds of thousands of players. It’s a shock hit that has come out of nowhere, and it’s dominating the gaming world despite having a bizarre theme. In this guide, we’re looking at whether Schedule 1 is multiplayer, and <strong>if it is</strong>, we’ll break down how to play with friends.</p>



<p>If you’ve been trying to play Schedule 1 co-op, read on to find out how it all works.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-co-op-in-schedule-1">How to Play Co-Op in Schedule 1</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to play Schedule 1 with your friends, you’re in luck – you can do so in both the free demo and the paid version of the game</strong>. To invite friends to your game, you’ll need to open the ‘Lobby’ menu that can be found in the top-right corner of the game scene. From there, you’ll utilise Steam’s friend mechanics to invite someone to your game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-schedule-1-multiplayer-work">How Does Schedule 1 Multiplayer Work?</h2>



<p>In Schedule 1 multiplayer modes, the host has all the power.</p>



<p>They’re responsible for saving the game, and any progress you make in someone else’s co-op lobby won’t impact your single-player adventure. That means if you buy Schedule 1 and boot it up and jump straight into your friend’s game, you’ll end up unlocking <strong>nothing in your single-player game</strong>.</p>



<p>You won’t even have a save file.</p>



<p>If you’ve already kickstarted a solo venture, you won’t be able to invite any friends to revel in your drug manufacturing madness.</p>



<p>It gets a little trickier when it comes to finances, too. Every dollar you earn and bank with your friends in Schedule 1 multiplayer is added to a collective pot – but the cash in your pocket is <strong>yours alone</strong>. Also, items can’t be shared between players unless they’re placed in storage.</p>



<p>Put simply, you need to put something down before another player can pick it up.</p>



<p>Oh, and you can only have a maximum of four players in both the demo and the paid version of Schedule 1.</p>



<p>That’s effectively everything you need to know about Schedule 1 multiplayer – have fun making drugs together!</p>
