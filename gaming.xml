		<p>Now I know what you are thinking, didn’t we have a remaster of Dead Rising back in 2016?&nbsp; Yes we did, but Capcom have announced a Deluxe Remaster which goes above making the game run on modern platforms and at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>It looks like all the graphics have had a major overhaul with Frank West now looking rather more haggard and rather older, gone are the luscious brown locks and in comes a rather scruffy, greying haircut.&nbsp; It also appears he has a new voice, fans have quickly noticed that it is not TJ Rotolo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aL8m3OaJ2g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is no other information about the game, the YouTube description just says “Hello? Is this thing on? This is Frank! Frank West! Is anyone out there? Grab your camera and prepare for the big scoop on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Stay tuned for more info soon.” However, with Gamescom round the corner this does seem to be just the sort of thing that would get a premiere at the event.</p>


<p>It’s unclear who is behind the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster as Capcom Vancouver,&nbsp; the team who made the Dead Rising games, was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/19/dead-rising-developer-capcom-vancouver-to-close/">shut down in 2018</a>. “As a result of reviewing titles in development at Capcom Vancouver, Capcom has decided to cancel the development projects at this studio and will concentrate development of major titles in Japan,” the company said in a statement at the time.&nbsp; It did appear that Dead Rising 5 was in development at the time but it was cancelled, and that was the last we have heard of the franchise until today.</p>

<p>The last Dead Rising title was the fourth in the series and that was also released back in 2016.&nbsp; Sadly the PC version which we&nbsp; reviewed was littered with bugs and issues and we scored it just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/15/dead-rising-4-review/">6/10 in our review.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced another remaster of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and this one looks like it's bringing a full visual overhaul to the classic zombie-slaying sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>was revealed earlier today via teaser trailer, and while we don't get to see much of the new project, we can see that the visuals seem to have been significantly improved, with protagonist Frank West sporting a much more realistic (and still very recognizable) face.</p>
<p>The new trailer covers the intro to the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, wherein Frank West is helicoptered into Willamette, Colorado in order to investigate a zombie outbreak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=ia5Mq6ub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=1OQzV5HO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everyone's favorite insane photojournalist Frank West is coming back yet again.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom describes the new version of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>as "an updated release with a brand new look" that's making its way to the current generation sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, along with a PC release, although it's unclear right now whether this new remaster will replace <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427190/DEAD_RISING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the existing one</a> on PC or be available as an additional version.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the brief announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, which is sporting a fun "DRDR" logo inspired by the original's graphic, right here.</p>

<p>The full extent of the changes Capcom will be making in this remaster aren't clear at the moment; it could just be a simple visual rework, or the studio could be taking this opportunity to sand down some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>'s sharper 2006-era edges.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what's in store for this new version of Frank West's inaugural adventure, but at any rate, it'll be much more worth revisiting than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-rising-4-review-coal-miners-glove">2016's awful&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which is probably why Capcom is going back to the start with this remaster.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will be available sometime in 2024, presumably for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Boil the kettle, we're having cheap ramen. If you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">homely castle creation</a>, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a> is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.</p>

<p>It's a "meditative city-sculpting experience"  according to designer, Matt Marshall, who made the game partly while travelling for a year across cities in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. "No goals, no management, just rich, atmospheric moods for contemplation, creativity and wonder," he says. What this means in real terms is that you're being given a toy for gardening a city skyline of the future. </p>
<p>The tools for building are sweet 'n' simple. You plop down buildings, choosing from among some themes. Perhaps you want those neo-pyramids of Omega Corp, or maybe the small blocks of lowtown. You click them into being, rotate them, resize them, and watch as a smattering of other tiny buildings appears magically around them. The automatic growth of a city happening in seconds. Very soon a handful of extra props are unlocked. For me, it all moves towards constructing a pleasing shot for the camera in the game's photo mode. Ah, there we are. Snap.</p>
<p>These no-frills builders evoke the feeling of dressing a set with pre-made props. You're preparing a scene, building up to that perfect frame, that pleasant feeling of satisfaction as you look over everything and think: yes, that's it. You don't have to think too hard about the fine detail of the props you're adding, it's all about composition, broad strokes. In Dystopika, you can get more into the nitty gritty as you go along, adding glowing advertisement billboards, neon lettering, holographic whales and (my personal favourite) little hovercar highways that criss-cross the city high above the smog-coated ground. But largely, it's like those other relax-o-builders, in that it invites you to stay loose and not worry too much. There's no wrong place to build a skyscraper. </p>

<p>When you feel ready, you can import images from your computer onto the huge billboards of the city, filling your neo-capital with the feline mascots such a metropolis deserves. So far I've only toyed with it for an hour, raising three distinct clusters of buildings at some distance from one another (in the cyberfiction of my own head, they are separate districts). New props, megastructures, camera modes, and mod features are planned for the future, says the creator in a road map on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/?curator_clanid=44991926">the game's Steam page</a>. But I can safely say it has already given me my six quids worth of focused cyber-flow. Please excuse me, my glasses are steaming up. Must be all the noodling. </p>

  <p id="BaGg6N">Prime Video’s <em>Batman: Caped Crusader</em> may not <em>exactly</em> be set in the same continuity as <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>, but if the first trailer is anything to judge by, it’s definitely set in the same nebulous time period. </p>

So it’s an intriguing, if winking bit of casting that finds him in <em>The Exorcism</em>, about an actor whose addictions tanked his once high-flying career and who now finds himself starring in the apotheosis of schlock horror genres: an exorcism flick.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It could have been delicious to watch Crowe chew up a role like this—cheeky, scary, profane. It could have been a lot of things.</p><p>But the intensity just isn’t there in director Joshua John Miller’s debut film. The script, written by Miller and his partner M.A. Fortin, does an excellent job of paying homage to the great demonic possession films of yesteryear, even name-dropping a few of them as exposition. But the joke only goes so far.</p><p>Crowe plays struggling actor Anthony Miller, cast in a new horror film <em>The Georgetown Projects, </em>a pastiche of both <em>The Exorcist</em> and <em>The Amityville Horror, </em>after its lead dies on set under mysterious circumstances. Running at a paltry 93 minutes, it’s a horror film about the making of a horror film that never really gets cooking.</p><p>Miller’s past haunts him. His daughter Lee, portrayed by an excellent Ryan Simpkins, arrives just as he’s cast in the film and is witness to his spiritual and physical relapse. Simpkins brings a nascent groundedness to Lee, who is fresh off a suspension from her all-girls school for an act of protest that may have been an act of arson. They and Chloe Bailey, who portrays Miller’s young co-star Blake Halloway, both bring a glow and warmth to the screen whenever they appear together. It makes for a nice contrast with Crowe’s erratic and increasingly cold Miller.</p><p>Rounding out the cast are Sam Worthington, Adam Goldberg, and David Hyde Pierce. All three carry their roles dutifully. Goldberg makes the most of his few minutes on screen as an acid-tongued schlock-jock. Sam Worthington’s character could have used more time and development. At points, you forget about him entirely. Pierce eats up every line he delivers, taking a moment to savor the ridiculousness around him, though he still gives an earnestness and clarity of faith to his performance as Father Conor. He mugs his way through the third act—worth the price of admission alone if you decide halfway through that you should have seen a comedy.</p><p>The short run-time doesn’t allow for much more than exposition, with jump cuts and placards speeding you along. Russel Crowe does what he can to bring a gravitas to Miller, but the writing doesn’t support his effort. And it all feels a tad self-serious and cloying, like something you might buy from the Vatican gift shop. If you were a fan of his take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 2017’s <em>The Mummy</em>, then you’ll enjoy his performance here.</p><p>The possessed move at alarming speeds, spines bend the way they shouldn’t, and the demon king Moloch might be an executive producer on the film. All in all, <em>The Exorcism</em> is a fun but hollow take on a staple of the horror genre. Crowe deserves a hell of a lot better, but don’t we all?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first time I ever touched a Nintendo 64 controller and held it like an idiot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/growing-up-sixty-four-1644419166&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/growing-up-sixty-four-1644419166">was in a Toys ‘R’ Us</a></span>. Some of its employees would go on to leak upcoming games to the world, and one even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-got-internet-famous-leaking-games-from-toys-r-us-1788187772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-got-internet-famous-leaking-games-from-toys-r-us-1788187772">got internet famous for doing so</a></span>. One thing everyone can agree on: it was a place created, run, and shopped at by humans. </p><p>So naturally, why not try to boil all of that down into a bungled series of god knows how many machine learning prompts? Billed as the “First Ever Brand Film Created with SORA,” the 66-second spot features an AI-animated depiction of Toys ‘R’ Us founder Charles Lazarus as a young boy in his dad’s bicycle shop. It shows him dreaming of a future filled with toys as a soulless woman’s voice creepily recites a two-sentence Wikipedia-style history of the company’s creation. The iconic Toys ‘R’ Us giraffe bobs along like a knock-off Pixar character wiped out by tranquilizers. </p><p>“We are thrilled to partner with Native Foreign to push the boundaries of Sora, a groundbreaking new technology from OpenAI that’s gaining global attention,” reads a description <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.toysrus.com/pages/studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the company’s website</a></span>. “Sora can create up to one-minute-long videos featuring realistic scenes and multiple characters, all generated from text instruction. Imagine the excitement of creating a young Charles Lazarus, the founder of Toys ‘R’ Us, and envisioning his dreams for our iconic brand and beloved mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe in the early 1930s.”</p><p>The whole thing is cringe, bizarre, and soul-crushing in a bunch of ways. First, there’s the fact that generative AI is theft. Then there’s the idea of trying to evoke “Rosebud” level child-like wonder and nostalgia using an artifact no humans were involved in making. Finally, the ad leans on the founder’s legacy to paper over the fact that Toys ‘R’ Us was put through a financial wood chipper by Bain Capital and others in the 2000s. It now exists primarily as the rent-seeking play thing of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anbmedia.com/news/retail-news/2021/03/whp-acquires-controlling-stake-in-toysrus/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anbmedia.com/news/retail-news/2021/03/whp-acquires-controlling-stake-in-toysrus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leading brand acquisition and management firm</a></span>” WHP Global. The company’s tagline is “activating the power of brand.” Apparently it couldn’t afford any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-convai-ai-demo-npc-dialogue-bad-1851345311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-convai-ai-demo-npc-dialogue-bad-1851345311">real artists, designers, or writers</a></span> to help do that in this instance. </p><p>I grew up to the dumb beat of inexorable technological progress. Change might be hard, but it was for the best.  Toys ‘R’ Us came in and supplanted mom and pop shops. Big box stores came in and supplanted  Toys ‘R’ Us. Now the algorithms for Google, Amazon, and TikTok shape what we imagine will fill the hole in our hearts when we click the buy button. It’s easy to to feel like it’s all just another version of the same old bullshit. Part of getting older is realizing that it’s definitely not. </p><p>I’m not going to pretend that the world would be a better place if there were a Toys ‘R’ Us in every zip code. But the idea of having a big store stocked entirely with frivolous, colorful chaos sounds naively whimsical in the year 2024. I have small children. I have been to the three disheveled toy aisles at the local Target, one of which is <em>still</em> pink somehow, and they absolutely suck. I have tried to find cool toys on Google and Amazon and it all funnels you to the same SEO-gamed, sponsored-ad junk. </p><p>It might seem like this has nothing to do with the AI-generated Toys ‘R’ Us ad, but its the same logic at work: remove the humans, maximize the profits, completely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enshittify</a></span> everything in the process. What you’re supposed to take away from from the ad is an affection for whimsy and a renewed appreciation for humanity’s enduring will to dream. But the real message is that dreams are cheap, and easily replaced by AI. It’s a proof-of-concept exercise leveraging a dead brand’s last drops of nostalgia for a pre-internet age aimed at convincing other companies that they too can cut costs by replacing human input with random slop. I’m sure there is a 21st century Lazarus dreaming of exactly that. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers, starting July 2: Borderlands 3, NHL 24, and Among Us.

While the main storyline isn't the best, the four DLC expansions tell a much better story and one of them <em>sort of </em>sees Handsome Jack return to menace players. The timing on this addition to PS Plus is also pretty good, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-clip-shows-shows-liliths-team-in-action/1100-6524061/" data-ref-id="1100-6524061">live-action Borderlands movie</a> will hit theaters in August.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325162"></a><figcaption>Ps Plus games for July 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4325162-ps-plus-july-1.jpg"></figure><p>Next on the list is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-24/" data-ref-id="5000-598603">EA Sports NHL 24</a>. This version of the game included several new game features and upgraded modes, and the Exhaust Engine was used to create more authentic experiences on the ice.</p><p>Lastly, you can gather some friends and wonder which one of them is a horrendous alien that defies mortal comprehension in Among Us. The game became a huge hit during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and since then, it has remained a firm favorite as a social game with its frequent updates and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-gaming-april-fools-day-jokes/2900-5219/" data-ref-id="2900-5219"> nightmarish April Fools' jokes</a>.</p><p>If you've never played it, Among Us is all about holding a spaceship together as your crew works to return to civilization. The catch here is that one of your crewmates is a shape-shifting alien, and they'll be aiming to sabotage the ship and kill everyone aboard. The remaining humans have to finish their tasks and identify the Impostors before it's too late.</p><p>As a bonus in July, PlayStation Plus members can also claim in-game rewards for Genshin Impact with an exclusive bundle.

The scene depicts Karlach realizing she's stuck in a video game, looking directly into the camera, and addressing the player on the other side of the screen.</p><p>Chubblot only managed to access the scene by using mods, suggesting the scene could simply be cut content not meant to be seen in-game. But things changed when Karlach's voice actress, Samantha Bert, commented on the mysterious discovery.</p><p dir="ltr">"Congrats on finding this, perhaps I'll comment on it when someone triggers it organically (rather than yanking the file and then getting confused about context)," <a href="https://x.com/SamanthaBeart/status/1703158961753502110" rel="nofollow">Bert said</a> of the odd cutscene, suggesting it may be possible to access without modding the game's files the way Chubblot did--and that players may have misinterpreted the meaning of the scene itself. Some players say they've encountered the cutscene, but none have managed to produce evidence of triggering it organically during their playthroughs, leaving fans of the franchise confused--and eager to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p dir="ltr">In response to Bert's comments regarding the scene, Proxy Gate Tactician <a href="https://youtu.be/BkvOeluJOCs?si=TiejTB6KADRlF1nz&amp;t=474" rel="nofollow">posted a video</a> detailing the hunt for the hidden cutscene and announcing the $500 reward.</p><p dir="ltr">"If someone can find a legitimate way--without modifying the game's files or cheating--to trigger this cutscene, post a video showing a method of how they did it, and others can do it themselves using that method, I will send you $500," Proxy Gate Tactician said in the video.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, no one has managed to pull it off, but knowing the Baldur's Gate 3 fandom, someone will hopefully rise to the occasion eventually--but it will certainly be a challenge, especially given the fact that dataminers say the scene is marked as "currently cannot be triggered" in the game's files.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-king-is-using-ai-to-speed-up-development-of-new-candy-crush-levels<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The firm has made level iteration 50% faster as a result of its playtesting bot</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>For King, the new opportunities offered by AI in improving and speeding up game development aren't new at all.</p>
<p>The Candy Crush maker has been utilising and researching machine learning and AI tech for over half a decade, which is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/king-purchase-ai-firm-peltarion">even before it acquired Peltarion</a>, the Swedish-based AI software company it picked up in 2022.</p>
<p>King's AI Labs is a sizeable department led by Sahar Asadi, and the firm has already introduced AI tools that its teams are using in games such as Candy Crush. In fact, one of those tools has already had a profound impact on the development of the hit mobile game.</p>
<p>"The playtesting bot we've developed gives designers, prior to releasing a level, an understanding of the game experience for the players," Asadi explains. "They can see whether the level they've created is providing the desired experience or not, and if not they can go back and refine it.</p>
<p>"We've also built on top of this bot a tweaking solution. If a designer says there are a few levels that don't have the intended experience, and these are the criteria for that experience, the bot can make refinements automatically. The best refined solutions are sent to the designers, and they can pick the best ones and go from there.</p>
<p>"The fun part for designers is to create levels. The mundane part is iterating, playing the level, looking at how it is, and if you're not happy going back and tweaking it. That manual work is mundane. The playtesting bot has been helping to reduce the time on tweaking, and that allows for more time on the creative part, which is making and innovating with levels."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/candy-crush.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Candy Crush level tweaking has been sped up significantly due to AI</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>AI being used to play games isn't new. We've had computers play chess against world champions for decades. But the AI that King has built isn't trying to beat humans but replicate them. And that required a different approach.</p>
<p>"For us, the key element about playtesting is to make sure it's human-like. A few years ago, there was this AlphaGo from DeepMind, which was playing Go against the master of Go, and the goal was to beat the best player. Here, we want to emulate our players. How do we make sure it is human-like? Let's say you're on move number two or three: [the bot] looks at the board, it looks at the possible actions you can take, and then decides what the best option is. And 'best' in this case is the one that is most probably taken by a human."</p>
<p>This behaviour is learnt from the data King gathers about its players, Asadi continues.</p>
<p>"We know millions and millions of states and the corresponding actions that [players] took. And the bot is learning this pattern. So for a new state that it sees, it can predict the most human-like response. It might not be the best option, but it's the most human one.</p>
<p>"We run the playtesting bot over a large amount of data. We have the level difficulty, and we have the bot estimate on the level difficulty and the overall challenge. And we will find a linear pattern, which is an indication that it is playing the game like a human. Also, we have been continuously working recently on how would you incorporate player skills and preferences into the bot so that you can make it even more human-like."</p>
<p>The impact of the bot has been significant. Asadi tells us that there are now 95% fewer manual tweaks being made to levels as a result of the playtesting bot, and that's led to 50% faster tweaks to the levels overall. But the bot isn't all about speed of development.</p>
<p>"It also really helps us to ensure the quality of the released level," Asadi says. "Is the level playable? How much shuffle does this level have? Does it give the right amount of challenge to our players? That is a factor in why we're doing this."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The way of working is going to change There will be some shift in what skills you need in the day-to-day work"</p></blockquote>
<p>The natural concern for employees is whether this is the beginning of the end for designers. If bots are successfully recommending tweaks to levels that designers are accepting, how long before these tools are building the levels to begin with?</p>
<p>"Absolutely we need designers," Asadi says firmly. "We see this as a co-pilot for designers. It's an assistive tool. What the playtesting tool provides is insights about the gameplay before releasing it. If the bot gets it right, we are sure that the insights are right. At the end of the day, the designers know what is fun and what they want from the gameplay experience. And then they can decide with these insights whether they should go ahead and release the level, or whether they should iterate more."</p>
<p>She adds: "What is fun? What is a good gameplay experience? Mathematically you can never explain it. The designer role is there to build that."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/candyscreen.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The playtesting bot will play a Candy Crush level as if it's a human</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What's more, these tools wouldn't be possible in the first place without the input from designers, Asadi argues.</p>
<p>"This whole tweaking system has been because of the close collaboration with designers. Their openness and excitement to try and get away from the mundane tasks to focus on the innovation, has been the main driver and incentivising everyone to spend time building this.</p>
<p>"If you go back in time, designers were using paper and pencils to design levels, then they moved to photoshop and now to new UI tools. I see this as another advanced tool that enables them to work on the things that are really skilful on. And hopefully it means we're building more exciting and interesting things."</p>
<p>Asadi may not believe AI will replace designers, but those mundane tasks she talks about are often the jobs that are given to entry-level employees to help them understand the processes. There are numerous people in the games industry who found their way into the business through testing, for example.</p>
<p>"The way of working is going to change," She admits. "There will be some shift in what skills you need in the day-to-day work. What are the new technologies and new products that we are building? So everyone's role, especially mine, is changing.</p>
<p>"Because of machine learning, a lot of things that engineers need to code, they don't need to anymore. When I am interviewing people today, I'm not basing it on the criteria that I used to hire people two years ago. But still, the gist of the things I need, and the understanding of machine learning, is still there."</p>
<blockquote><p>"For other companies, AI is moving fast, but how would you integrate it technically, culturally and in terms of getting the value out of it?"</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving forward, King's AI Labs is looking at ways that the company can get a better sense of its players and what they want at different times.</p>
<p>"For instance, if I sit on a bus and I have five minutes, I want to get to the level I was playing as fast as possible," she explains. "When I am sitting in the sofa, and I have half-an-hour, I might want to do different quests in the game. Getting this context and what is needed to get this joy out of the gameplay… that is something that could be rewarding for players. Part of our research is how, using foundational models and with the new developments in machine learning, we can capture a better representation and understanding of players, and feed that into the game in order to build a better experience."</p>
<p>AI is developing rapidly and it may only be a year or two before King's current research is implemented into its games. Yet the speed in which King can move is because of this early investment in AI tech. For other studios, the immediate opportunity AI represents will depend on whether they're ready to make the most of it.</p>
<p>"The landscape of AI development is changing very fast," Asadi concludes. "It makes it very exciting because it creates new opportunities to innovate, which keeps me and my team on our toes. It creates huge opportunities to bring that research into the game. But a huge factor is how ready the games are to take in these technologies. At King, we have this opportunity because we have already started, we started much earlier with some internal research, then the acquisition of Peltarion, which means we have the expertise. We have a very good connection with the game, and we're making the game ready to integrate with the AI solutions. That helps us to go fast.</p>
<p>"For other companies, that is something to consider. AI is moving fast, but how would you integrate it technically, culturally and in terms of getting the value out of it? That's critical. Very often my team works on something that gets to the game in one or two years. And I hope that the new solutions we're talking about can go even faster."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/forza-horizon-4-is-being-delisted-15-december-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playground Games has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> will be delisted from sale late this year on 15th December 2024, thanks to those pesky “licensing and agreements with our partners”. Between now and then, the game will be going on a steep discount, with the possibility to grab a game token for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> players who bought any kind of DLC for the game.</p>
<p>This discounted pricing hasn’t been announced or put into place on Xbox yet, but Forza Horizon 4 is 80% off on Steam at £10.99, while the Ultimate Edition with DLC is now £16.99. <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ">All standalone DLC has already been delisted</a>, so the only way to get the Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions DLC packs are to buy the Ultimate Edition.</p>


<p>Xbox Game Pass players who purchased DLC content and who had an active subscription yesterday, 25th June 2024, will receive&nbsp;a game token through the Xbox Message Center that will be delivered in the coming days to turn it into a full digital license for the game.</p>
<p>With the game being delisted, the next Festival Playlist will be its last. Series 77 will run from 25th July through to 22nd August, with the usual smorgasbord of weekly challenges and activities to take part in. After that point the festival playlist history will stay in the game, but players will be skipped through to the Festival Site screen instead of to the Playlist. There will also still be daily and weekly challenges in the game.</p>
<p>This final Series will be the last chance to earn the following Achievements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Creature of Habit – Complete all Seasonal Championships in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Stunt Puller – Complete all Seasonal PR Stunts in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Cashing In – Earn 1 Season Completion Bonus.</li>
<li>Perfectionist – Earn all 8 Season Completion Bonuses in the same Series.</li>
<li>Encore? – Complete all activities in a single Festival Playlist Series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forza games being delisted used to be a yearly occurrence in the late 2010s, as licensing for music and/or cars expired on a game-by-game basis. However, there’s been a lull since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/30/forza-motorsport-7-delisting-september-big-sale-discount-offer-xbox-game-pass/">Forza Motorsport 7’s delisting in 2021</a>, and Forza Horizon 4 stayed relevant at the start of the Xbox Series X|S generation thanks to a native port to the new generation, before Forza Horizon 5 arrived two years later. As game releases have spread out, it’s possible that Microsoft has signed longer licensing deals, so that the 2018 game will have had a healthy six years on sale, as opposed to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/12/forza-horizon-3-delisted-september-games-with-gold-possible/">Horizon 3’s four</a>. Additionally, the latest Forza Motorsport is set to be a longer-lasting racing platform, so licensing deals will have been made to take that intention into account.</p>
<p>Of course, Forza Horizon 4 will still be totally playable after it’s been delisted, and it remains a real highlight of the series to date. Launching in 2018 for Xbox One and Xbox One X, it was a fantastic visual showcase that toured a rendition of Northern England and Scotland. In our review, Dom said, “The opening alone, which takes you through Forza’s beautiful changing of the seasons, forced me to quite unknowingly smile like a buffoon a number of times despite my default malaise of British apathy, and the game continued to force this cheery outpouring from me for hours upon hours. So, it’s good. Unless you don’t like smiling. Horizon 4 is fuelled by the same anarchic arcade racing streak as previous entries in the series, but its new additions ensure it remains firmly at the head of the pack.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-price-drop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-sliced-permanently.911910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-price-drop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a permanent&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>&nbsp;price drop, so if you missed out on one of 2024's best games, now's your chance to pick it up.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/price-drop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by PCGamesN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is now $10 cheaper across all platforms, and you'll probably be able to find it at a lower price if you're picking it up physically now as well.</p>
<p>PCGamesN asked Ubisoft about the price drop, and the studio confirmed that the change "is permanent" rather than being due to a sale, so you don't need to worry about missing out on this deal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=RuK9DPuE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=7K8XiFDN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 2024's best games is now permanently cheaper.</figcaption></figure><p>No reason was given for the price drop, but we can make some educated guesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam in August, so it's possible Ubisoft wants to lower the price to make the game more enticing for Steam players. It's likely a launch discount will also be applied to further attract Steam users at launch.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Ubisoft believes it got the price for the game wrong the first time around and wants to make an adjustment to put the game more in line with some of its fellows, although it's still not as cheap as the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Nine Sols</em></a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a real win-win for anyone who's yet to check this game out, because&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is one of the most underrated games of the year already, and we're only in June.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is a 2.5D Metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on acrobatic platforming and combat.</p>
<p>You play as Sargon, a warrior of the Persian Immortals who must travel to the mystical Mount Qaf in order to save the captured Prince Ghassan. Along the way, you'll engage in classic&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia</em>-style platforming challenges, take on massive bosses, and upgrade your abilities in true Metroidvania fashion.</p>
<p><i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>might be a single-player experience, but there's still plenty of new stuff on the horizon for it, including a new chunk of single-player DLC that was announced during the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft Forward showcase</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751000/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/9NBV5QFW83WC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and after the price drop, I'd heartily recommend you do.

<p>To kick things off, game director Rich Aldridge spoke of plans to “continue in the mold” of Thrones Of Decay’s pricing scheme, which split the factions into three separate, cheaper purchases. As for the shape the expansions might take, Aldridge said that “the big news is that you’ve shown us where the importance of the game is, and that’s Immortal Empires". The "next DLCs will be focused on Immortal Empires specifically,” although this doesn’t mean they’ll stop supporting the smaller Realms of Chaos campaign in terms of balancing and bug fixes. I do hope this means bringing some of the more focused narrative campaigns into the wider sandbox with things like worldwide story events. A hopelessly addicted man can dream.</p>
<p>On the upcoming DLC: It’s an ogre-haul, baby! Aldridge confirmed that the new Legendary Lord - or subfaction leader, if you’re new around these parts - will be the long-suspected Golfag Maneater. He’s a travelin’ man(eater), fond of exploring the world and finding strange and new cultures to eat. There will be more characters revealed later, but the video does spoil a few of the new units: the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusk</a>, which is actually an ice-type unit, confusingly, and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Vultures">Blood Vultures</a>. These look to fill the ‘annoying flying unit’ archetype common among many factions. Not especially sexy, but with a huge amount of battlefield utility.</p>
<p>Next up, it’s Khorne. The legendary lord is <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/U%27Zhul_the_Skulltaker">U'Zhul the Skulltaker</a>, who I’d describe as an angry red man if that narrowed it down at all. Let me try again: he collects skulls. Nope, still too vague. He likes <em>interesting</em> skulls, like a mad stamp collector. Ok, that’s fun. Maybe he’ll get a lord skull trophy rack? Maybe Queek can get the same one! I’ve somehow turned this into a conversation about rats and I don’t care. For Khorne’s new units, they showed off the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterbrute">Slaughterbrute</a> (Big, Red, Angry, like a daemonic Kool-Aid man).</p>

<p>Next up, it’s your boys and mine, the Greenskins. For the LL, it’s <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Gorbad_Ironclaw">Gorbad Ironclaw</a>. We haven’t had a boar-mounted orc lord yet (or indeed, any DLC orc lords, they’ve all been gobbos), so this is interesting to me, an enjoyer of furry pigs. They also suggest a diverse new roster, including not-so-subtly confirming a <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">Colossal Squig</a> on the horizon.</p>
<p>In terms of free bits, Aldrige reaffirms a return to the free LL format, last seen with Nurgle’s Epidemius. This time, it’s another Khorne lord, though they’re staying schtum on which one.</p>
<p>As for details on future content, Alridge says that getting the rest of the Chaos gods fleshed out is the main priority, which more than likely means Slaanesh is next. He also suggests sooner-rather-than-later updates for Vampire Counts, Norsca, and - happy days! - the glorious Lizardmen’s not-so-glorious Geomantic Web.</p>
<p>My high level take on the video is: it's great to see Rich Aldridge in the flesh and chatting about the game! Rich and his team have always felt like the beating heart of all that's great about the series, and even if it's still marketing, it's a fine choice to highlight his team talking about a game they're evidently brimming with passion for.</p>
<p>If you don’t fancy waiting, a quick reminder that Khorne got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-total-war-warhammer-3-patch-has-that-large-red-khorne-dog-your-ordered-plus-a-new-competitive-multiplayer-mode">a free dog</a> this week (angry, red). A quick reminder, also, that a former Creative Assembly developer<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> recently took to Medium</a> to allege a culture of mismanagement and “limited by design” AI, dating back to the launch of Rome 2.</p>

Alexander told <em>Kotaku </em>through a DM that he, as well as Twitter users @Swirlymark, @rnaidens, @sexdisrespecter, @FlingLatraniz16, @Dorkp0rk, @beelolbop, and one anonymous fan, all came together to place these images in one of the busiest areas of New York City because they thought it “would be really funny.” But Alexander also says he believes Venture deserves “more love and recognition” within the <em>Overwatch </em>community.</p><p>“I really like Venture’s personality,” Alexander said. “They’re so energetic and fun!

Prince Jacaerys (Harry Collett) meets with Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) on top of the Wall and accepts the best fighters that Lord Stark can dispense for Team Black. It’s comforting to be back on the Wall and hear a Northern drawl warning that “winter is coming.”</p><p>Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best), after dragon-watching the blockade of trade routes to King’s Landing, gets into it with a raving Daemon (Matt Smith), who questions her loyalty to Team Black. Daemon continually tries to assert his dominance but is reminded of his low rank. “It is a command,” he yells at Rhaenys. “Would that you were the King,” she tosses back.</p><p>In Drismarck, Lord Coryls (Steve Toussaint) assesses the state of the shipping fleet and meets Alyn, the sailor who saved his life. Then the “enduring mystery,” Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) ominously tells King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) about fearing “the rats.”</p><p>Of course, rats surround King’s Landing. Lord Larys (Matthew Needham) exterminates Otto Highwater’s spies in another ploy to have Queen Consort Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) owe him. When Alicent isn’t worrying about the impending war or her alliance with her father, she’s finally getting hers with Kings Guard commander Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel). Alicent is no angel, but after years of bedding a pus-filled King Corpse, she deserves a ride or two.</p><p>The Team Green council meeting goes awry with too many cooks in the kitchen (one being the 4-year-old heir that Aegon decided to bring to work). Aegon flounders as king. He can’t even resolve a small-time farming dispute, let alone enact his Dragon v Dragon war plan. Naturally, Aegon’s woeful leadership and need to be liked by the masses makes him the perfect puppet for Alicent and Otto to control. But the sneaky Larys starts campaigning to be Aegon’s new Hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-recommend-id="image://2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1778" data-height="1180" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Queen Rhaenrya stands overlooking the water.

Her palpable grief turns into a stern call to action as she delivers her only line in the entire episode, “I want Aemond Targaryen.”<br></p><p>Daemon heeds the call and cuts a deal with Miseryia (Sonoya Mizuno) to identify ratcatchers. He hires the disgruntled Blood and Cheese to kill Aemond. But Blood and Cheese throw out their original plan when they stumble upon the King’s heirs and the Oracle Helaena in the nursery. “A son for a son” is just as good in their eyes as they force Helaena to point out the male heir and slaughter him (thankfully off camera). The episode ends with Helaena clutching her daughter and fleeing for help.</p><p>Any hesitation from either Alicent or Rhaenerya about going headlong into war is squashed by their need to dole out Hammurabi’s Code: Eye for an Eye. Son for a Son. Heir for an Heir. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-director-defends-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt has defended FromSoftware for the difficulty of Elden Ring expansion Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/helldivers-2-director-weighs-in-on-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-difficulty-a-game-for-everyone-is-a-game-for-no-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, Pilestedt responded to someone on X/Twitter who complained about the intense difficulty of Shadow of the Erdtree, which has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier">a heavily discussed topic since its launch</a> on June 21, 2024.</p><p>Pilestedt initially shared another post saying FromSoftware doesn't make bosses hard for the sake of it, but for the feeling overcoming them gives players. "Indeed, this 1,000%," Pilestedt said. "Good game design is evoking emotion more than anything."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A game for everyone is a game for no one.</p><p>Always cater to a select audience.</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1805317649628348612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>X/Twitter user @Indoor_Carrot responded, saying "the problem with this design philosophy is it only caters to a select audience. I tried Dark Souls 1. After defeating the first couple of bosses, I realized it wasn't fun or rewarding. I only felt relief, not accomplished. I stopped playing Dark Souls because of this."</p><p>Pilestedt disagreed. "A game for everyone is a game for no one," he said, which is essentially the motto of his developer Arrowhead Game Studios. "Always cater to a select audience."</p><p>FromSoftware games like Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice are famously difficult but have been praised across the board for their overall game design, challenge included.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">IGN's Shadow of the Erdtree review awarded it a 10/10</a>, for example. "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark role-playing game, condenses it into a relatively compact 20 to 25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p>But some who've purchased the expansion have expressed frustration at the difficulty, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">even review bombing it on Steam because of it and performance issues</a>. Regardless, FromSoftware boss and Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki has remained true to his vision, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-making-elden-ring-easier-would-break-the-game-as-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launches">saying making things easier would "break the game."</a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>If you're interested in diving into the world of high-end controllers for PS5, there are several great DualSense alternatives. One of the new kids on the block is the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro, a controller designed to offer a more premium experience. Normally $200, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Officially-Licensed-PlayStation-Controller-5/dp/B0CLBLFDBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get it for $175 right now at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846189413506010154%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-great-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6524508%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2>Nacon Revolution 5 Pro PS5 and PC Controller</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324992"></a><figcaption>Nacon Revolution 5 Pro controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Officially-Licensed-PlayStation-Controller-5/dp/B0CLBLFDBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $175 ($<strike>200</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846189413506010154%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-great-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6524508%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy (Black model only)</a> -- $175 ($<strike>200</strike>)</li></ul><p>There is some great technology under the hood of the Revolution 5 Pro. It has Hall Effect joysticks to help keep stick drift at bay, trigger-locks to decrease the travel distance on each pull, four customizable Omron micro-switch back paddles, interchangeable weights, and several swappable thumbsticks. Interestingly, the D-Pad on this controller was created in partnership with professional fighting game player Mister Crimson, so if you're a Street Fighter 6 or Mortal Kombat 1 player, you might want to check this out. If the exotic design doesn't appeal to you, you can swap it out for a more traditional D-pad.</p><p>For compatibility, the Revolution 5 Pro will work on PS5, PS4, and PC. It has up to 10 hours of battery life from a full charge, and if you're running low on juice, you can switch to a wired mode using the included USB-C to USB-A cable. It comes in two colors, white and black.</p><hr><h2>Alternative high-end gaming controllers</h2><p>The Revolution 5 Pro is in competition with several other pro-style PlayStation controllers. Most notably, there's the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge</a></strong>, PlayStation's premium first-party controller which costs $199. Another alternative is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BQ1PDR4R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</a></strong>, which is on sale for $230 (was $250). The Razer Wolverine V2 Pro is a really nice controller with a chunky design, making it great for anyone with big hands. This PS5 and PC controller has inputs with a shorter actuation distance for quicker button presses and an 8-way microswitch D-pad.</p><p>While it's not on sale, the $174+ <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PDP-Victrix-Wireless-Controller-Playstation-5/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP Victrix Pro BFG</a></strong> is a stellar customizable controller. This one has the conventional pro-style features--four back buttons, trigger locks, etc.--but it also has a modular design that lets you swap the position of the left analog stick to offer aligned or offset layouts. There's also a six-button module that's great for fighting games. With multiple D-pad styles and detachable thumbstick caps, the Victrix Pro BFG is a well-rounded PlayStation and PC controller--it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3PJKRV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available for Xbox/PC</a>--that's well worth considering. In fact, it's one of our top picks for DualSense and Elite Series 2 alternatives on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">best PS5 controllers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/" data-ref-id="1100-6473486">best Xbox controllers</a> lists.</p><p>If you are thinking of getting a high-end controller primarily for PC, we'd recommend the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B07SFKTLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2</a></strong> controller instead.

It's a flashy marketing term for an overhauled physics and collision system that aims to make hits and collisions look and feel more powerful. Madden NFL 25 also has enhanced tackling and rushing systems, improvements to the hit stick, and better pass-protection adjustments for QBs.</p><p dir="ltr">The game also has multiple commentary teams this year, with the tenured pair of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis being joined by Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen, as well as Kate Scott and Brock Huard. Also new for the game is the ability to create a female head coach for your fantasy team.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - New Season 4 Reloaded Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3, weapon balancing is revealed for multiplayer, including a major nerf for the powerful Kar98k marksman rifle. The update removed hipfire aim-assist properties and decreased the strength of ADS aim assist properties for controller input devices. The developer says these changes to controller aim assist properties were to align the Kar98k with the sniper rifle class.</p><p dir="ltr">The overpowered akimbo variant of the Lockwood Mk2 is also nerfed. This nerfs the gun's JAK Wardens Conversion Kit, decreasing the maximum damage range by 33% and the near-medium damage range by 20%.</p><p dir="ltr">The midseason update includes a few multiplayer map adjustments as well. Rundown now has improved consistency with bullet penetration on low-wall surfaces, and multiple areas were adjusted on Season 4's Tokyo map to fix places where enemy nameplates could be seen through walls. Exploits were fixed on Scrapyard and Terminal that previously allowed players to interact with Demolition objectives from an unintended location.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says changes were made to the Mortar Strike to make the killstreak more difficult to run from and avoid. The adjustments removed the two-second delay between when the target is marked and mortar fire begins, decreased mortar travel time by 25%, decreased the delay between mortars, and added an increased number of mortars per wave from four to six.</p><p dir="ltr">For Ranked Play, the MTZ-556 and the Holger 556 assault rifles are now unrestricted and available to use for competitive play.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's update also includes a nerf to the Kar98k. This adjustment includes the same change for controller input to align the marksman rifle with snipers, but it also decreases the maximum damage range from 63.5 meters down to 55.88 meters, and reduces the bullet velocity from 660 to 620 meters per second.</p><p dir="ltr">The MCW assault rifle is buffed to make it more viable in Season 4. The minimum damage is increased from 22 to 24, and the bullet velocity is raised from 710 to 750 meters per second.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4's overpowered C4 lethal equipment is nerfed. C4 now has decreased maximum damage from 275 to 200, decreased outer damage from 137 to 100, and a lowered maximum radius from 7 to 6.5 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> can be found here, as shared by Activision.</p><h3>NEW MAPS</h3><p>Incline (6v6)</p><p>Explore a research outpost in the mountains of Urzikstan in Incline, an original snow map featuring intense fights in hostile weather.</p><p>Das Gross (6v6)</p><p>In this horrifying map variant of Das Haus, blood drips from the walls, and sharp, pointed teeth protrude from exposed muscle.</p><p>Bitvela (6v6)</p><p>Visit a pixel-art-inspired variant of the classic Favela in the Bit Party Playlist.</p><p>G3T_H1GH3R</p><p>Get High returns with a new course full of obstacles and surprises.

		<p>The SteamWorld series is a little bit like the sprawling menagerie of Pixar films. While these games share a particular steampunk style and aesthetic, developer Image &amp; Form has consistently surprised and delighted as they explore different genres and game styles with each and every game. Almost. Just like Pixar being lured back for Toy Story, Cars and Monsters Inc. sequels, SteamWorld is also returning to one of its most popular stomping grounds with SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JArPke5KNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original SteamWorld Heist arrived in 2015, tipping the turn-based strategy XCOM-like format on its side, quite literally. Instead of having a birds eye view of proceedings, moving characters on an isometric world grid, the game switched to a side-scrolling 2D view, putting a lot more emphasis on layers and elevation, as well as player skill as opposed to percentage hit chances.</p>


<p>Truth be told, as much as I loved its core concept – enough to buy the game three or four times in various deep discount sales –&nbsp;I never actually played SteamWorld Heist for more than a few hours. I might have to try and right this wrong, after settling in for the opening of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p>Thankfully, while they share a gameplay core, SteamWorld Heist 2 tells a completely new story. Set in a fragment of a planet that’s covered in water and small islands, Steambots are being subjugated by the Royal Navy and their fleet of Dieselbots, the fresh water that they need to survive is becoming ever more scarce, with the salty sea water corroding and destroying any that resort to it.</p>


<p>Enter the hero of the piece, Captain Leeway. Well, actually he’s the one-armed son of the legendary Captain “Krakenbane” Leeway, and has struggled all his life to live up to the expectations of greatness that are heaped upon him. Also his submarine just got commandeered by the Royal Navy, and it’s halfway been stripped for parts.</p>
<p>The game’s opening sees you get to grips with the game’s take on turn-based strategy with some of Leeway’s crew –&nbsp;it was his gun-shootin’ arm that got blasted off, so he doesn’t actually do any fighting for himself. Daisy Clutch and Wesley Hotchkiss charge through the Navy’s rank and file, taking cover, ricocheting bullets, chucking grenades and more on their way to securing the sub.</p>
<p>It’s a fun opener that very quickly introduces the game’s core mechanics –&nbsp;characters have two action points, Daisy’s sniper rifle has an aim line that sways and you time your shots while Wesley’s SMG does not, and you’ll want to master bullet ricochet, spot explosive barrels and more. It also builds up to a neat crescendo of a boss encounter against Commander Batterfaux and his big shark-themed mech suit, with big AOE missile strikes that keep you moving while you chip away at it, shattering the windscreen, blasting off the fuel tank, and the like.</p>

<p>From there, missions come in several varieties, from simple ship clearing jobs to races against time as loot threatens to decay, defensive missions to survive a dozen turns, tasks to take out a particular enemy character, and more.</p>
<p>Who you take into a mission is pretty simple to decide early on – you’ve just got Daisy and Wesley until you can recruit some more –&nbsp;but as missions get bigger and your crew grows, you’ll have to choose between characters in different jobs. Brawler, Boomer, Engineer, Sniper, Reaper, and Flanker each come with their specific main weapon and skill tree to work through, but as with many RPG job systems, you’ll eventually be able to switch characters to a different job and mix and match skills and abilities. I’m looking forward to exploring this aspect more as I get deeper into the game.</p>
<p>With SteamWorld Heist 2 diving into the wet stuff, the between mission action is now a fun little sailing game as you pilot the submarine between missions, safe havens where you can rest up and grab upgrades, and battling with smaller Navy ships.</p>

<p>Cap’n Leeway’s sub has been stripped of all its good stuff by the Navy, so you (in)conveniently have to start from scratch, scavenging your first weapon and trying to get air tanks to allow you to submerge again. This ship combat is a neat little diversion with three weapon slots that automatically fire from the front, sides and top of the sub. The initial machine guns I go could blast away to either side, each salvo then needing a little cooldown before it fires again. With how manoeuvrable the submarine is –&nbsp;it practically drifts when turning – I quickly mastered a good little spin trick to fire with one side and then the other to deal with these initial Royal Navy ships in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The sailing overworld is lovely and bright, as you peel back the clouds shrouding the gorgeously azure waters and tropical islands on the opening region – I also love the smooth jazz of the soundtrack in this area. That’s immediately contrasted with the dank and moody interiors of the submarine, ports and enemy ships you raid, though there’s plenty of nice touches to the backdrops. It’s neat to see how Image &amp; Form’s art style has evolved, retaining their long-standing aesthetic, but now seemingly using 3D models as opposed to layered digital art.</p>
<p>I’m still only bobbing on the surface of SteamWorld Heist 2 and the overarching story of Captain Leeway’s redemption arc, the Royal Navy’s incursion and other narrative threads, but there’s also all the depths of the jobs and combat to explore, and I’m keen to dive, dive, dive back in for our review.</p>

		<p>In April this year the developer Poncle announced that Vampire Survivors will be released on PS5 and PS4 in the summer and it’s now officially summer as I have my aircon on, so where is Vampire Survivors?</p>
<p>Well it seems Sony’s submission process, the mechanism that all publishers need to follow to get their games on PlayStation, is causing Poncle a few headaches. It doesn’t seem like there’s anything particularly massive holding things up, just that it’s the first time they have had to do it.</p>


<p>“A<span>s it’s now summer we’ve had a lot of people asking when the PlayStation release will be happening </span><span>&nbsp;we want to keep you all updated, as we still don’t have a release date to share, but wanted to let you know why,” <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451">tweeted Poncle</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“This is the first time we’re going through submission processes on PlayStation so it’s taking a little longer than usual we’re also doing some trial and error on Trophies to ensure we get them right BUT we’ll let you know ASAP when we have a solid date.”</p>

<p>Poncle&nbsp; recently released the Operation Guns DLC, which based on the Contra franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns DLC feat.

<p>The update is a small one; it doesn't have extensive <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1-12-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, nor does it make any adjustments to things like boss movesets, so if your woes are related to some of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s more hair-raising boss moments, you won't find what you're looking for here.</p>
<p>However, this update does make some changes to the Shadow Realm Blessings you can obtain to boost your damage and negate incoming pain.</p>

The second half will represent a more gradual increase.</p>
<p>Additionally, the final level of Blessings will now grant slightly more attack power and damage negation, so if you're using Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash, you should notice a difference.</p>
<p>If you're experiencing an unstable frame rate on&nbsp;the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, this update recommends that you check the Ray Tracing setting, which may have defaulted to being switched on if you've loaded your save from previous versions of the game.</p>
<p>Future balance adjustments and bug fixes are coming soon as well, so if these fixes don't smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>experience, don't worry; more changes are on the way.</p>

			<p>Nexon and Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/26/the-first-descendant-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-july-2-new-character-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have revealed</a> The First Descendant PS5 graphical features available on Sony's console ahead of the game's launch next week.</p>
<p>The third-person looter shooter from Nexon releases globally across PC and consoles next week on July 2, and ahead of this release, we now know some more about the graphical modes on Sony's console. Although not yet specified, it's likely that these features will also be available on the Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Not yet available in the game's beta, The First Descendant has a new Balanced Mode on PS5. In total, PS5 players will have access to three graphical modes - balanced, performance, and fidelity with the latter focusing on resolution, and the performance mode focusing on higher frame-rates. As you might guess, the Balanced Mode will fit in between these two modes.</p>
<p>On PS5, The First Descendant will also support Ray Tracing as well as AMD Frame Generation and Virtual Shadow Map (VSM), enhancing the game's overall visual quality.</p>
<p>Aside from providing these additional graphical features on PS5, Nexon has also released character gameplay trailers, which we've included below:</p>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5.2, The First Descendant launches next week on July 2nd for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. On PC, the game will<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> support HDR10+</a> Gaming and<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-gets-crossplay-beta-with-dlss-3-support-in-late-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NVIDIA DLSS 3</a>. Earlier today we talked about our impressions from the game following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-summer-game-fest-impressions-let-the-loot-rain-fall-on-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gameplay session</a> earlier this month. Here's what we wrote about the looter shooter:</p>
<p><em>"For the second portion of my gameplay session, I picked one of the playable regions at random and delved into the arctic region, thinking it to be a good change of pace from the boss arenas although my bunny girl was quite underdressed for the occasion. I had just enough time to eke out a zone recon mission and jump into a few shootouts for loot and glory before my session came to an end. One thing that I'll have to give Nexon praise for is continuing the trend of implementing Korean vocal tracks into your open world exploration. It's a thing I thoroughly enjoyed in Stellar Blade, and I earnestly want the trend to continue."</em></p>

<p id="BW5awf">So, when IDW Publishing and Mattel announced they were partnering for a set of American Girl graphic novels for the kids of the 2020s, I got <em>really</em> excited. Polygon got the chance to read the first, <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, written by Casey Gilly and drawn by Felia Hanakata, before it was released to readers this week. <em>Blue Guitar</em> continues the American Girl tradition of telling fascinating historic stories through a hopeful lens, but it also brings forth a failure inherent in the dolls themselves: their singularity.</p>
<p id="SH4UoM">Gilly and Hanakata are not new to transforming iconic franchises into comic books — between them, they’ve worked on well-received tales in the canon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <em>The Dragon Prince</em>, My Little Pony, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, to name a few — so it’s no surprise that <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar </em>is compelling and inventive. </p>
<p id="KgBIPH">The creators build on the history of Julie Albright, a ’70s-era doll introduced in 2007, bringing her story into the 21st century via her diary, which is discovered by the book’s present-day lead, Emma Dhillon, while moving into her new home in San Francisco. This kicks off two parallel tales — one in which Emma makes a documentary about her journey to figure out who Julie is, and Julie and her friends try to solve the mystery of a stolen blue guitar in 1977.</p>

<p id="7cU8TG">To keep the stories straight, Hanakata borders Emma’s sequences in blue and Julie’s in yellow, but I’ll admit I was confused by the premise at first. A panel of Emma and Julie shouting simultaneously while facing each other had me thinking we were time traveling for a moment — but once I settled into the parallel narratives (and the color coding), I didn’t put the book down until I finished it.</p>
<p id="ZrWoEA">It wasn’t just the American Girl nostalgia that kept me turning the page. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. Hanakata’s thick-lined, brightly pigmented representation of Julie is refreshingly modern compared to the photorealistic imagery of her <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americangirl.com%2Fpages%2Fjulie-albright&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24185954%2Famerican-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">on the American Girl website</a>. The pages designed to look like the inside of Julie’s journal make me excited for kids who get to create imaginary worlds for their Julie dolls based on what they learn about her in this book.</p>
<p id="CeVbdo">Julie’s story also centers on her motivation to raise money to benefit the San Francisco Bay oil spill cleanup, which is based on the real-life spill that happened in 1971. In true American Girl form, the last few pages of the book contain information about several real-life historical events that inspired elements of the story.</p>

<p id="HJW0Ax">It’s not only accurate in the historic sense. Gilly and Hanakata aren’t shy about incorporating modern technology and vernacular, which feels like a great way to keep young readers interested. Emma films her documentary on her smartphone, illustrated to look like the UI of a real phone, down to the puppy filter that pops up on Emma’s face in a few scenes. Gilly strikes a nice balance of modernity, sending Emma’s character to the library to look through local yearbooks that don’t exist in digital form, just like Julie’s diary. </p>
<p id="SS6OXm">However, this book throws one of my biggest reservations about American Girl as a now-adult feminist into stark relief. Hanakata’s Emma is short with dark hair that fades to pink at the ends, framing her round face and complementing her relatively chubby build. Julie is consistent with other American Girl artwork of the doll: She’s thin and willowy, with long, blonde hair. </p>

<p id="Z0qNQl">But though you can buy a Julie doll, you can’t buy an Emma doll. I tried to create a custom Emma doll on the American Girl website, but I couldn’t find a hairstyle or color to match, nor could I customize her shorter height and thicker body shape. No matter what, every American Girl doll is predestined to be 18 inches tall with a soft, flat belly and legs that don’t touch. </p>
<p id="j4VwDo">It isn’t that the dolls are particularly harmful in their representation — compared to the wide world of big-brand dolls, they’re not overly skinny, and you can select from a range of skin colors and hair types. But their homogeneity in body type means that, in media like this comic, the dolls are all represented similarly, too. </p>
<p id="LAbMC6">In short: There hasn’t been a fat American Girl doll yet, and it’s past due. For one reason or another, Gilly and Hanakata chose to represent <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>’s main character as having a body dissimilar from Julie’s, and that begs the question: If American Girl’s new graphic novel line can build compelling stories with body diversity, when will American Girl reflect that in its main business?</p>
<p id="XfecaS">The book cashes in on body diversity in a good way — I’m glad young readers will see a smart, intriguing character that might look more like them in American Girl media — but Mattel fails to back it with dolls that purport that value, too. It’s a shame that kids would have to get creative with their dolls to create narratives that match the body diversity in <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, because the choice to make Emma different makes for a better graphic novel. Why can’t those varying shapes and sizes exist for the dolls, too? </p>
