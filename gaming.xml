            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-gets-graphical-updates-versus-modes-multiple<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Though most Capcom fighting fans are looking ahead to next month's arrival of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="254c61b7-b9ae-4243-b832-89ef551d2039" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/15/revisiting-forgotten-friends">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a>, the publisher is showing that it will continue to support its existing compilations. Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics arrived last September on PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC before arriving on Xbox One in February, but that isn't stopping Capcom from improving the library of included games months later.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, players will be able to download a free title update for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. The update will improve specific elements of select games and deliver several overall tweaks and bonuses to the bundle. Most notably, the free title update adds Versus mode to all six of the fighting titles. Additionally, Capcom has provided updated options for how you access the menu to avoid accidentally triggering it mid-match. You'll also be able to reset your current game straight from the pause menu. All of these updates mentioned so far will also be added to Capcom Fighting Collection and Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>

<p>This update also adds new artwork from Capcom artist Shinkiro, plus new Cap-Jam remixed songs. Meanwhile, X-Men vs. Street Fighter now allows players to select from multiple versions to experiment with different balancing and gameplay. Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes receives graphical and resolution enhancements via this free title update. Check out the specifics through the trailer below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zTTwFVmrLk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics gathers seven of Capcom's collaborations with Marvel, including six fighting games and one beat 'em up. The full list includes X-Men Children of the Atom, Marvel Superheroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Superheroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and The Punisher.</p>

<p>This update to Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics will be available tomorrow, April 16, across all platforms. For more on Capcom's recent fighting-game collections, check out our hands-on preview of the upcoming Capcom Fighting Collection 2 <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="254c61b7-b9ae-4243-b832-89ef551d2039" href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/15/revisiting-forgotten-friends">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/screenshots-of-the-rumored-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-have-leaked.1165458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/report/2025/04/15/screenshots-of-the-rumored-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-have-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Screenshots from the unannounced but heavily rumored remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion have leaked online. Apparently, fans unearthed the images by digging through the website of the gameâs reported developer, Virtuos Games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The images, which have now been circulated on social media by popular accounts such as <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1912121397867872406">Wario64</a>, various forums like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/?rdt=35724">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/">ResetEra</a>, and have been uploaded to image galleries like <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a>, depict several before/after screenshots comparing the original game to its updated visuals. Various pieces of key art, including an image of the gameâs Deluxe Edition and its contents, have also surfaced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">IGN</a> </em>noted, Virtuosâ website is currently down at the time of publishing. Itâs been heavily reported that the studio is developing the remaster alongside Bethesdaâs Dallas and Rockville studios, per <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-screens-and-details-have-leaked/">Video Games Chronicle</a></em>. The game will reportedly feature both visual and gameplay enhancements/changes to the 2006 open-world RPG. Virtuos has generally served as a support studio for numerous titles, having previously worked with Obsidian on The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition and other remasters such as Batman: Return to Arkham.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A remaster of Oblivion has been rumored for some time, dating back to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/19/leaked-microsoft-doc-indicates-xbox-is-working-on-oblivion-remaster-fallout-3">leaked Microsoft documents</a> that surfaced during the companyâs 2023 FTC trial (itself three years old when it was leaked), stating the project was in the works. Speculation has ramped up in recent weeks, with reports from various journalists and <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">online leakers</a> claiming inside sources pointed at an April launch for the game and that it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC alongside Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was already quite a bit of smoke to this fire, and todayâs leaks would all but confirm the Oblivion remasterâs existence. Bethesda and Virtuos have not responded to the situation at the time of publishing. Weâve contacted Bethesda and Xbox for comment and will update this story with a response should we receive one.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/15/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dune: Awakening has been delayed. The upcoming MMO based on the popular sci-fi universe was originally scheduled to arrive on May 20.</p>

<p>Developer Funcom explains the delay will allow the team to address feedback provided by players following the Persistent Closed Beta. As such, the game will now launch on June 10, with a head start beginning on June 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>âDune: Awakening is a beast of a game,â says Funcom in a statement. âThis is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and weâre making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing.â&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funcom also explains that the delay allows them to host a large-scale beta weekend next month that will host even more players. The team plans to share more information about this beta soon.</p>

<p>You can read Funcomâs complete statement&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1912144059843379626">posted to X</a> below (click the image to enlarge).&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:1,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6fddde6c-4068-431c-8885-0d6ede900a4c" data-langcode="en"><a data-featherlight="image" href="">
</a>







</article><p>Dune: Awakening was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamescom-2022/2022/08/23/dune-is-getting-an-open-world-mmo">first revealed</a> during Gamescom 2022 and is an open-world survival-focused MMO. The game takes place in an alternate timeline to the recent films as players must work together to survive Arrakis by crafting resources, architecture, and locating water. Despite its multiplayer nature, Funcom promises to deliver a cinematic storyline with Duneâs lore permeating the experience through server-wide politics and intrigue. The game allows for multiple approaches to getting ahead, whether amassing political power, controlling the Spice trade, or simply acting as a scouter to map out the world and sell that information to players. You can learn more by reading our extended preview from last year <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/03/04/spicing-things-up">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening will be available for PC via Steam on June 10, with PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions planned to launch sometime afterward.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>More than 100 notes to collect and read in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> are scattered throughout its 14 chapters. That might seem like a lot, but if you follow this and every other chapter guide I've posted so far, you'll see how it's straightforward to pick each one up along the way as you play through the game.</p>
<p>And you'll want to grab them all because South of Midnight's storytelling, including these written notes, is by far the strongest part of the game.</p>
<p>There are another 10 notes to collect in Chapter 6. Here's where to find them all.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 6</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 doesn't give you much of a break compared to Chapter 5, as this chapter has 10, instead of 11, notes to pick up. As you'll see below, at least a few of them are clumped together.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Keep Out Sign Materials</strong> - A little ways into the chapter, after using an echo of a crashed boat to jump across a river; you'll find the first note of the chapter on a box to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Abernathy's Lament</strong> - You'll find this note on the second level of the barn you go through to find the hole for Crouton to enter and get rid of the Stigma Knot blocking your path. To get there, you'll need to enter through the roof, which you can do by heading back the way you came through the barn, where an echo of a wagon is sitting and waiting to your left, behind a couple of trees trapped together with vines. Use the wagon to jump onto the roof of the barn, and through a hole in the roof you'll reach the second level which contains a health filament and the note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burn After Reading</strong> - Once you see Bunny's cottage, before you walk through the gates you'll see a path to your left that leads to a combat encounter. Once you've cleared it, as you head back to Bunny's cottage you'll find this note resting on a box between two rocks to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Correction Requested</strong> - After walking through the gates to Bunny's cottage, walk around to the back of the cottage to find a large tree in her backyard and a small cabin to the right of the tree. Walk past the cabin and you'll see some sunflowers next to crates of honey, with the note resting on a honey crate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on the Rogarou</strong> - You won't find this note, or the next three, until after completing the three combat encounters to get into Bunny's cottage. Thankfully, this note and the next three are all inside the cottage, so you're clearing through a bunch quickly. This first one is on a table in the room to your right once you walk in the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bunny's Journal - On Weavers</strong> - This note is in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's left bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Notes on Dreams and Fog</strong> - This note is also in Bunny's bedroom on the second floor, on Bunny's right bedside table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Missing Children List</strong> - You'll find this note in the secret room behind the bookshelf in Bunny's bedroom, on a desk towards the back of the secret room, to the left of where you'll see Huggin' Molly's red yarn.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrowers Hate a Liar</strong> - After the cutscene with Bunny, and once you're in your new duds, follow the path away from the cottage and beyond a few exploding mushrooms. You'll find this note in a dead tree on the right side of the path.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Huggin' Molly Sightings</strong> - After speaking to Catfish, follow the path beyond some more exploding mushrooms to the point where you'll see two paths. One that leads you to the tree Catfish was talking about by using your grapple, and the other to your left with the echo of a bridge. Take the left path to find another combat encounter, and once you've cleared it, you'll find this note on a box to your right as you exit the combat arena.</p>
<p>And that's all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 6. You should have 38 out of 103 by now. Only 65 more to go.</p>

            <p>
I feel like all I've been seeing the past few days is people asking if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will be the game that finally brings extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> into the mainstream. No one seems to be quite sure, mostly because it isn't done or out yet. The thing is, it's not the only extraction shooter due out this year that'll put that question to the test, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one the way still too. It comes from former Battlefield devs after all, who have found success with their other shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>. And earlier today, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/embark-studios">Embark Studios</a> announced that another playtest for Arc Raiders is on the way this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Signing up for the playtest is pretty simple on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a>, you just have to head to the game's page and request access to the beta. The test itself is running from April 30 to May 4. Not everyone will be able to try it out, I should note, it's luck of the draw, but if you're feeling lucky and you're curious as to whether extraction shooters can make it mainstream, it's worth a shot.

In a press release Embark shared that they've taken on a bunch of feedback from the last test, implementing a bunch of "tweaks and improvements." They've also added in more Arc enemies (evil robots that have taken over most of the world), as well as weapons and gear. Player progression and crafting systems are apparently "deeper" now too, and there'll be a preview of what the game's battle pass will be like.
</p>
<p>
I like the vibes of Arc Raiders a lot. Bit of a stereotypical "humans are in hiding in tiny settlements because robots have wrecked the planet" kind of premise, though it looks good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs&amp;ab_channel=ARCRaiders">in motion</a>, and I'm digging its particular flavour of a post-apocalypse setting.
</p>
<p>
That's the thing though, Marathon looks good in motion too, and based on most previews, plays good too. There's some specific complaints people are having about Marathon (namely a worrying lack of content at launch) which raises further questions as to whether it'll be the one to make a notoriously tough genre like extraction shooters popular.
</p>
<p>
I honestly can't say how things will shake out. Games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> are still trudging along quite well, maybe it doesn't need to be a massively popular genre. Guess we'll have an idea by the end of the year!

		<p>With rumours and reports of a The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake having circulated for years at this point, the latest has come directly from developer Virtuos, with screenshots and details coming from their website.</p>
<p>Further to the screenshots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer has also now reported</a> that Bethesdaâs plan is to shadow drop the game next week, launching it across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC â and on Xbox Game Pass, of course.</p>


<p>The images were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, theyâve now been <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">copied across to imgur</a>, while the studio has taken their site offline. Weâll point you toward imgur if you want to see the full selection, but hereâs one example:</p>

<p>Thereâs definitely an awful lot more detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>

<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and it will be fascinating to see how it comes together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>I guess we wonât have too long to waitâ¦</p>

			<p>Strong as<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/"> South of Midnight's</a> story is, reading every note along the way really does add to the storytelling in a special way. Which is why you'll want to read them all, even if you're just trying to find them for the achievement.</p>
<p>These guides will tell you where to find every note in the game, all 103 of them, across South of Midnight's 14 chapters.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 5</h2>
<p>If you've been following along with the rest of these guides, then you'll recognize that Chapter 5 has more notes than any level so far. Here's where to grab all 11 of Chapter 5's notes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's Pieces of the Selfâ</strong>The first note of the chapter is found right after you've found Crouton, in the hollow tree immediately next to where you'll send Crouton to do away with the stigma.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Statue Flyer</strong> - After continuing further into the level, and completing the first combat encounter (which will also show you the first memory), you'll find this note on a broken fence post, just below the giant Auntie Belle's sign and statue.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Iron</strong> - You'll find this note just in front of Jolene's church, after the cutscene with Ms. Pearle and Jolene. It will be on top of a box that's next to the fence, which will be immediately to your right once the cutscene ends.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hollow Dreamers</strong> - After grabbing the last note, follow the path the strands layout for you across the water towards a house that's covered in vines. The note will be on a couch that sits on the porch of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Kids Need a Hand</strong> - After fighting your first Slug Haint (the big round enemy that digs underground) and seeing the second memory for the chapter, you'll find this note inside the house that'll be right in front of you, and on the table to your left when you walk through the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Jo's Penance</strong> - Before leaving the house, walk up the stairs to the second floor, and head to the room at the end of the hall, which will also be the only room left open for you to walk into. You'll find this note on a desk with a guitar leaning against it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yard Sale Notice</strong> - This note is a little further into the level, and you won't be able to get to it until you've reached Swopes Farm. To reach it, you'll first have to use an echo box to climb a high tower where you'll find a Floof knot. From this vantage, you'll also be able to see over a tall stack of hay bales. Jump over the hay bales to the other side, and turn left towards a trailer, then right towards a small cabin. You'll find this note resting on a folding chair.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Honor thy Father and Mother</strong> - Once you're back to where you climbed the high tower, head towards the big house on your right. The door will open when you get close, and you'll find this note in what looks like the family room immediately to your right when you walk in.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bashful Farmhand in the Setting Sun</strong> - Before leaving the house, head up to the second floor, where you'll find a Floof knot in one room, and this note on a desk next to a typewriter in the other.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Pigs are a Loss</strong> - When you make it to the Pig Factory, inside the factory you'll enter a room with a Floof knot on top of a container to your left. The note, on the other hand, is on ground level, sitting on a table immediately to the right of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sutter's Will and Testament</strong> - After the Two-Toed Tom boss fight, and after you've been swallowed up by the giant gator, you'll find this note once you've made it to the other side of the pool the squealing pig from earlier is swimming in. It's on the wooden floor, next to a lamp.</p>
<p>That's all 11 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 5. If you've been following along with these guides, then you'll have acquired 28 out of 103 now. Only 75 more to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-frontier-games-shuts-down-amid-financial-struggles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Final Frontier Games is closing down. The Macedonia-based tabletop developer is closing after nearly a decade of producing board games. This closure results from five years of financial struggle, leaving three crowdfunded projects unfulfilled.</p>

<h2>The Closure of Final Frontier Games</h2>

<p>The news of Final Frontier Games' closure came from a backer update sent via their Kickstarter projects. That update was made public <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jzorko/final_frontier_games_laying_off_and_declaring/" rel="nofollow">via post</a> on the r/boardgames subreddit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=nnBqFpVl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-frontier-games-merchants-cove-cover-artwork.jpg?itok=KQ5v1mRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the backer update, Final Frontier Games states that cash has been tight for a while and after a large order for Chinese localized copies of <em>Merchants Cove</em> fell through, they cannot fulfill the Kickstarter projects that have been fulfilled. The post continues, citing other compounding production issues behind the scenes that eroded their finances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We cannot understate the gravity of the situation and the suddenness of the fall of the company. We are emotionally devastated, sad, we are hurting, we are angry and there is a big hole in our hearts that will take a long time to overcome, if ever. Just recently we were tweaking ads for our next campaign, talking with reviewers, preparing for production on our other games, developing our future projects and entering a distribution partnership with QML, something that we had lacked for 4 yearsâ¦ hoping that the payment will come through.</p>

<p>All our dreams and hopes vanished. 10 families that put food on the table through Final Frontier Games that had stable, creative and good paying jobs are now faced with extreme uncertainty with no financial stability. We are truly living in the darkest timeline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result of these developments, Final Frontier Games' three current Kickstarter projects - <em>Merchants Cove: Master Craft</em>, <em>The Sixth Realm</em>, and a <em>Coloma </em>reprint, have remained unfulfilled despite funding of $1.39 million. This is the culmination of protracted financial struggles for the company going back to their first Merchants Cove Kickstarter suffering serious production issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>According to FInal Frontier Games, the order that fell through was with tabletop giant CMON. The update stated that CMON had initially agreed to pay 50% before production then the remainder after the process was complete. Allegedly, this deal was changed to paying the entirety once the games were ready to be picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Frontier agreed to this change. But, according to them, the last possible day for payment came and went with no contact from CMON. Despite multiple emails being sent, no one at CMON got back to them regarding payment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CMON has yet to make an official statement or comment at the time of writing.</p>

It's been a little over a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palia">Palia</a> had its proper launch, and its next big update, the Elderwood Expansion, received a little reveal today. This update is mostly focused on a new area, the titular Elderwood, and it'll be free for everyone. That doesn't mean everyone will be able to play it right off the bat though, as it's designed for higher level players that have already beaten the main story (you can still head there beforehand if you're impatient).
</p>

<p>
Looking at the trailer I'd say that the big theme here is the colour purple. It's everywhere, that's just the vibe of the place I suppose. In terms of actual additions, outside of the new area itself, there's apparently a new story. There's some kind of essence infecting the area, but story details are pretty light right now.

You'll find a couple new creatures to track down like the Ogapuu and Smole (yes, these are their names), and there are hidden artifacts that can net you some strong relics, a "new equipment system that buffs you and your party." On top of that there's new fish, insects, and plushies too. It seems like a pretty sizable update, one that feels surprising to be completely free, but hey, the whole idea is that the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a>, so, no complaints here!
</p>
<p>
The update is arriving pretty soon too, on May 13, where it'll be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. I mention this only because the game has cross-play, so if you've got some console buds that have been wanting to check Palia out, now might be the time to give them a nudge.

What started as a somewhat empty and not-great MMORPG has evolved into a very popular online world filled with quests to do and regions to explore. And now, Bethesda is going to sell off pieces of the <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em>âs original server blades that have since been retired. Exactly 2,000 pieces, in fact.</p><p>On April 15, Bethesda announced the â<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gear.bethesda.net/products/the-elder-scrolls-online-10-year-anniversary-server-keepsake&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gear.bethesda.net/products/the-elder-scrolls-online-10-year-anniversary-server-keepsake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> 10-Year Anniversary Server Keepsake.â</a></span> This item consists of a decorative, framed plaque with a stick of RAM removed from one of <em>ESOâs </em>original servers. Bethesda will sell you this âactual physical piece of Elder Scrolls Online historyâ for $110. Well, you can pre-order it starting today. The actual plaque and RAM wonât be delivered until July 2025. </p><figure id="" data-id="8f83936086fadb3e6ac02893ae05f5b2" data-recommend-id="image://8f83936086fadb3e6ac02893ae05f5b2" data-format="png" data-width="1518" data-height="794" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8f83936086fadb3e6ac02893ae05f5b2" data-recommend-id="image://8f83936086fadb3e6ac02893ae05f5b2" data-format="png" data-width="1518" data-height="794" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>According to Bethesda there will only be 2,000 of these <em>ESO </em>keepsake packages created and sold. Each one will be numbered and come with a certificate of authenticity, which will be useful for those looking to flip this thing on eBay in a few years.</p><p>Iâve played a lot of <em>ESO</em>, but Iâm not really a dedicated fan. Still, this is a really neat idea and something more MMOs and online games should do. Blizzard did do something like this with a<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23140711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23140711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>World of Warcraft </em>server back in 2019</a></span> as part of a charity auction, and that is also cool. Let people own pieces of the servers they spent years of their lives on. Because while <em>ESO </em>and<em> WoW </em>might be successful now, eventually they will shut down or the world will move on or something else will happen and the games wonât be playable anymore.  But  at least you can hold onto a real piece of them and thatâs neat!</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
