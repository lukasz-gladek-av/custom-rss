            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-publisher-game-pass-rational<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher Take-Two, has rejected the idea that his studio's games could end up on Game Pass on day one of their release, suggesting such an idea isn't "rational".</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-expects-call-of-duty-will-boost-game-pass-numbers-for-a-period-of-time" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Zelnick says he expects that including day-one releases on a subscription service will "push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time".</p>
<p>However, he goes on to say that Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">decision to include games like&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass on day one</a> "won't affect [Take-Two's] decisions" because the publisher's decisions are "rational".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-6-take-two-game-pass-comments.jpg?itok=4elNuWR- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-6-take-two-game-pass-comments.jpg?itok=cjOl8iob 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect to see&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Zelnick's stance echoes comments he made back in 2022, when he said that including day-one AAA releases on a subscription service "doesn't make any sense to [Take-Two]" because he thinks it represents "turn[ing] our business upside down in a way that doesn't make sense economically".</p>
<p>With that in mind, if you were hoping to see&nbsp;<em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>arriving on Game Pass on day one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">when it launches next year</a>, or even a few months down the line, you may want to stop holding out hope for that happening.</p>
<p>These comments come after Take-Two <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/606b4f51-58cd-4838-a9e2-55138ff5d8eb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released its financial summary</a> for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, showing small gains in the areas of net bookings and net revenue.</p>
<p>Take-Two points to <i>NBA 2K24&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>GTA 5</em>, as well as its online component&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>, as the main drivers of the increase in net bookings, and those games were also the key drivers behind the revenue increase, with&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Online&nbsp;</em>also contributing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/take-two-financials-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg?itok=QfItzJg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/take-two-financials-red-dead-redemption-2.jpg?itok=1lEq5QJo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Red Dead Redemption 2&nbsp;</em>is still trundling along for Take-Two.</figcaption></figure><p>In light of these numbers, Zelnick also told GamesIndustry.biz that he thinks his studio is in the right place when it comes to the market, pointing to recent cost-cutting measures as part of "tun[ing] up" the studio's "efficiency".</p>
<p>Those cost-cutting measures appear to include the closure of Roll7 and Intercept Games, the studios behind&nbsp;<em>OlliOlli World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2"><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a>, although Zelnick himself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied reports that the studios were closed</a> when asked.</p>
<p>When it comes to Take-Two's future pipeline, plenty of games are in the works. Between the 2025 and 2027 fiscal years, the company intends to release tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>,&nbsp;new games in the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>franchises, and&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>.</p>
<p>Take-Two's financial presentation slideshow also says that&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, the next game from&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine<i>,&nbsp;</i>will launch at some point in this broad release window, although it's seemingly too early for the publisher to commit to a definitive time period for&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>' release. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <p>Annapurna's delightful Stray will finally make its Switch debut later this year, on 19th November.</p>
<p>Whilst we knew the kitty caper was on its way to Switch courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">June's Nintendo Direct</a> presentation, Annapurna confirmed the release date yesterday, which also just-so-happened to be International Cat Day.

<p>In her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-review-fantastic-cat-exploration-through-a-dystopian-cybercity">Stray review</a>, Lottie said, "Stray captures the essence of being a cat, while delivering a deeper journey through a dying cybercity.</p>
<p>"It's by doing this - looking at the world through feline eyes - that Stray creates a journey filled with such a sense of exploration, on top of the chance to indulge in as much cat-truction as you like. While doing so, though, it also crafts a touching story about the human desires of those who, at a glance, lack humanity - be it to reunite with a loved one, protect a community or reach the outside world. The result is a wonderful mix: a game about the longing for freedom, clever climbing mechanics, and every cat’s eternal desire to knock items off shelves."</p>

<p>Annapurna Pictures' animation arm - which produced DNEG Animation's recently released Nimona - is planning a "respectful" adaptation of the fan-favourite cat adventure.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The majority of Arcane's second and final season has been leaked online, three months ahead of its intended November launch. 
</p>
<p>
Five episodes, along with many from other animated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> shows such as Terminator Zero, Dandadan and Ranma 1/2, have been posted on social media and are now being shared around Torrent sites. 
</p>
<p>
It's a huge blow for a brilliant series that has been almost a decade in the making - six years for its initial season that debuted to universal praise in 2021, and then another three years to develop its second season this November.
</p>
<p>
On the main Arcane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/">reddit</a>, which has 200,000 subscribers, moderators are now discussing whether to shut down the board completely until November to stem the spread of leaks and ensure fans wishing to wait do not get spoiled.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-08-06/episodes-of-new-ranma-1-2-and-dan-da-dan-anime-1st-mononoke-film-leaked-online/.214035">Anime News Network</a> reports that the leaked episodes are of low-quality, and include watermarks stating they are for Netflix internal use only. It's unclear how the various episodes have leaked, and Eurogamer has contacted Netflix for more detail.
</p>
<p>
Arcane is of course the brilliant animated series based on characters from League of Legends, created for Netflix by Riot Games and talented French animation studio Fortiche.
</p>
<p>
Back in June, Netflix and Riot Games confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane's long-awaited second season would be its last</a>, but that a "larger storytelling journey" would continue based on other tales from the same world.

You play as a traveling salesman in a vaguely 1970s world, where you do odd jobs for the many locals. And hit a lot of things. It’s exactly as strange as you’d expect from the developers of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>.</p><h2 id="h1208"><a id=""></a>How long is Thank Goodness You’re Here?</h2><p>While its objectives often require some trial-and-error to complete, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> is relatively linear and has no fail-state. That means you can’t die and are free to simply explore the world at your own pace.</p><p>As such, if you’re the kind of player who just wants to push through the town without engaging fully with its many peculiar denizens at every turn, you can wrap up <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>’s story in just <strong>two to three hours</strong>. But don’t do that, you’ll be missing out.</p><p>There’s a surprising amount of content that’s easy to overlook in <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, especially if you’re looking to obtain all of the game’s trophies or achievements. You’ll need to do things like knock on every closed door, find a lot of animals hidden in places like trash cans, and speak to certain characters at specific times during the story to move their side-stories along.</p><p>When going for this kind of full completion—especially without a guide—you can expect to spend up to <strong>six hours</strong> with <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, as you may need to run through the game multiple times to wrap up anything you missed.</p><p>There’s no denying that <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em> is a relatively short game, but that doesn’t mean there’s not plenty to see (and plenty of butts to slap). More importantly, the game is such a delightful romp that it’s well worth the entry price regardless of how much time you spend exploring its wacky town.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-pipeline-plans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-expects-call-of-duty-will-boost-game-pass-numbers-for-a-period-of-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new interview</a> with GamesIndustry.biz, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick commented on the impact of Call of Duty coming to Game Pass and the company’s pipeline.</p>



<p>Zelnick said that offering a frontline title like Call of Duty “day and date” could “push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time.” </p>



<p>Regarding subscriptions and Microsoft’s push to include Call of Duty in Game Pass, Zelnick stated that “it won’t affect our decisions.” They added that is “because our decisions are rational.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Zelnick also spoke about Take-Two’s recent reductions. In May 2024, reports surfaced that Take-Two could be working on a plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-is-shutting-down-its-indie-label-private-division-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division. </p>



<p>In the new interview, Zelnick clarifies that “we have narrowed down the pipeline to focus on the titles that we think will be the most successful.” Zelnick cited Take-Two’s three-part strategy to be the “most creative, most innovative and most efficient.”</p>



<p>They add that Take-Two cut “about $165 million out of the annual run-rate of the business.” Zelnick says that Take-Two is currently “very much” at the right size for today’s market. </p>



<p>Just yesterday, Zelnick also personally addressed rumors about the potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership between FIFA and 2K Sports</a>.  And in a new financial update this week, Take-Two Interactive revealed that the GTA 6 release window <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-release-window-unchanged-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unchanged</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-is-a-game-with-just-one-button-this-hard.949155/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/one-btn-bosses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in June I played the <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-next-fest-demos-summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> for <em>One Btn Bosses</em>, a game where your only weapon against a series of bosses is a single button that moves your character. The full game came out earlier this week, and I’ve been enjoying it, even if I’m repeatedly getting wrecked.</p><p>There’s a loose narrative laid over the game, a play on rising through the ranks of an office environment (“bosses,” you see), but it feels like it's there just to give some personality to the gameplay. You guide a little triangle along a track, in the middle of which sits some kind of boss enemy. You shoot automatically, so your one button is about dodging. At first, the button only makes you change directions; as you progress, you get the ability to dash through boss attacks, speed up in the opposite direction, and more.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="One Btn Bosses - Official Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WldHLxkAW5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The boss attacks include basic projectiles, rays, spinning pillars, homing missiles, size-changing shapes that do damage, shields that have to be taken out to progress a fight, and this one attack that clearly telegraphs its path that I nevertheless constantly screw up. Things can get pretty chaotic when more than one of these elements is on the screen; so far, my best tip is to ignore the colorful chaos and just focus on where your triangle is and what it's headed into, something that isn't easy when there is <em>so much</em> going on. Every few bosses you face off against some kind of megaboss, who has to be beaten a number of times in different arenas to progress. I’m on the third one right now, where one of the available fights didn’t give me too much trouble, but the rest are kicking my ass.</p><p>The game is <em>tough</em> in the way boss fight games are. Picking the right ability helps, but you need a combination of memorizing attack patterns, good timing and reflexes, and patience to make progress. I lack all of these things, but I’m still having a good time in the game, enjoying its simple art style, fast pace, and (hypothetically) short levels. If you lose a fight, a progress bar shows you how far you got, which is a nice feature both for helping me think I fared better than I did, and for convincing me to try just one more time.</p><p>There’s also a roguelike mode if you get too stuck on a boss, which you can switch to at any time in the game’s campaign. Overall, <em>One Btn Bosses</em> does a lot with its simple premise, mixing things up without throwing too much new stuff at you at once. I will probably never beat it, given how much I suck at boss fights, but I’m enjoying trying. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-will-not-award-erotica-points-for-taking-crotch-and-cleavage-photos-like-original/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu article</a>), the "erotica" bonus, which was awarded for taking photos of things like female characters' cleavage, upskirt shots, and other sexually-charged images, won't be present in&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, it's an upcoming remaster-come-remake of 2006's zombie-killing classic&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, which sees photojournalist Frank West exploring a zombie-infested shopping mall to find the perfect scoop.</p>
<p>The original game tasked Frank with rescuing a number of survivors throughout the mall, taking on colorful psychopaths as boss fights, and arming himself with a variety of novelty weapons in order to slaughter hordes of zombies.</p>

As I re-watch it in 2024 at 34 years old, the song reaches into my chest cavity and grabs my beating heart, urging it to quicken its pace and remember what it felt like to kiss a boy while that song played tinnily over a car radio.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m 16 again, and life stretches out before me full of passion and promise. Maybe one day I’ll be an It Girl living in New York City, and I’ll buck relationship trends to fall in love with a brooding, artistic young man with an impressively lush amount of chest hair. Maybe I’ll hand-sew my own dress based off of an expensive designer gown so I can wear something fabulous to a fancy Upper East Side party. Maybe I’ll go to college, get a degree, graduate without debt, and find a job that’ll afford me enough money to buy my own house. It’s all possible, right? Wrong.</p><h2 id="h4841"><a id=""></a><strong>Rewatching <em>Gossip Girl </em>in 2024</strong></h2><p><em>Gossip Girl</em>, based on the young adult novels of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, aired from 2007 to 2012 on what was then known as The CW (though you can watch all of it on streaming service Max right now). It straddled the 2008 financial crisis, but remained steadfastly embedded in the glorious excess of Manhattan’s elite. Now, it serves as a window into the world as it was back then, before the housing market collapse, the election of Barack Obama and subsequent conservative backlash, the reign of the iPhone, or the proliferation of social media. Watching it now is equal parts shocking and satisfying—it’s so unabashedly, awfully catty and controversial that I’m surprised it stayed on-air for as long as it did.<br></p><p>The aforementioned sweet, hopeful <em>Gossip Girl</em> moment comes just seconds after an attempted sexual assault by Bad Boy Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick, who had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/gossip-girls-ed-westwick-has-been-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-a-third-woman/news-story/fbe31c5065dd11693662d89be80d6d49&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/gossip-girls-ed-westwick-has-been-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-a-third-woman/news-story/fbe31c5065dd11693662d89be80d6d49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault allegations levied against him</a></span> back in 2017) on Dan’s younger sister Jenny (Taylor Momsen), and right before Kristen Bell’s snarky Gossip Girl narrator reminds us that Serena will be aggressively bullied by Chuck and her former best friend Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) once school starts again on Monday. It embodies what makes <em>Gossip Girl</em> such a pristine snapshot of the aughts: the casual violence against women, the glorification of underage drinking and drug use, the brutal dashing of hopes and dreams, the material excess, the almost ceaseless needle-drops of your iTunes top 25 most played, the quick-witted, shrewdly sarcastic dialogue of disaffected teens. Nothing will shove you into a time capsule, hastily input “2007” into its console, and unceremoniously ship you back nearly 20 years more than <em>Gossip Girl</em>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9e64209f84e8569883f9352b6594315a" data-recommend-id="image://9e64209f84e8569883f9352b6594315a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Serena and Blair talk on the steps of the Met." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Serena and Blair talk on the steps of the Met." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->CW Network / Courtesy Everett Collection / Warner Bros.

There is a casual cruelty to <em>Gossip Girl</em> that defined so much media from that era, that helped create today’s internet culture in which horrible insults can be lobbed at you from any direction. After all, this is the same era in which emo music reigned supreme, music in which self-proclaimed sensitive boys demonized young women who didn’t love them, music that dominated my every day. Girls who grew up in the early aughts internalized these ideologies—slut-shaming, body-shaming, status-shaming, style-shaming—and carry them still today.<br></p><p>That’s why the 2021 <em>Gossip Girl</em> reboot was doomed to fail (and fail it did, after just two seasons, though at least it took a page out of the OG’s book and was largely shot on-location in NYC). It couldn’t recreate the cruelty of the original series without being “canceled,” and it couldn’t present a neutered version of what made the aughts show so popular without coming off toothless. Like a scientific phenomenon that can only be replicated under the most specific conditions, <em>Gossip Girl</em> could have only ever existed from 2007 to 2012.<br></p><p>I’m 34, sure, but just an hour with <em>Gossip Girl</em> transports me back into the body of my teenage self, bringing with it a surge of emotions and memories that crashes over me like a sewage-filled wave from the East River. But at least now when I watch it, I know for sure that Chuck Bass is a fucking scumbag, and that you should never wear a straw fedora with a cocktail dress. That’s growth. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I have only one criticism of the "definitive, newly enhanced versions" of&nbsp;<a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes"><em>Doom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Doom II</em></a> you can now pick up in a $10 package or as a free upgrade if you already owned one of those two games. My gripe is that it is entirely your own fault when you get hit by enemies.</p>
<p>On a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/doom-doom-ii/9p46m5jq2ptf">Xbox</a> X or S, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA21444_00-OSIRIS2000000000">PlayStation</a> 5, you can play&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>at 120 fps at 4K. You are moving so ridiculously fast, speed-skating across those Marine bases and/or hellscapes, that the imps tossing fireballs at you feel like they're a parent gently coaxing their kid to catch a softball. Even the enemies with instant-hitting guns feel like they're winding up a tree sap cannon. The one time I died inside the first three levels of classic <em>Doom</em> was when I jet-walked right off a circular path and into an inescapable poison moat.</p>

<p>It's easy to recommend this newly packed-up and enhanced edition of these two first-person icons, released Thursday as part of QuakeCon. For one thing, it's being offered by Nightdive Studios, which has been turning out fan-favorite (and generally Ars-approved) remasters of games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/dark-forces-remaster-is-yet-another-all-timer-fps-coming-back-around/"><em>Dark Forces</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"><em>System Shock</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/quake-remaster-owners-should-go-download-its-free-next-gen-upgrade/"><em>Quake</em></a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/quake-ii-gets-a-remaster-for-pc-and-consoles-and-its-exactly-what-it-needs-to-be/"><em>Quake II</em></a>. For another, it's a real bundle, with both games, a huge number of classic add-on maps (including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/john-romero-will-release-18-new-maps-for-dooms-25th-anniversary/">John Romero's&nbsp;<em>Sigil</em></a>), and an entirely new episode,&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Rust</em>, made by folks from Nightdive, id Software, and&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em> auteurs MachineGames.</p>
<p>And then there's how playing these levels feels, which to me is as close as I can get to the caffeine-pulsing, speed-metal-blasting flow state I remember from much younger days. I've installed&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> and played a few levels now and then, but this is the first time I've made plans to keep going after the first session. After sprinting through a well-trod Hell, I'll be eager to keep going in <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, where I saw quite a few cool design tricks in just a couple levels. Further along, new weapons await me, and I am eager to pick them up.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4-xswoPRpo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Doom + Doom II</em> release trailer.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Wonderful, optional options</h2>
<p>It helps that this version incorporates the rearranged, real-instruments "IDKFA" soundtrack from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hulshult">Andrew Hulshult</a>, first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGK1dr-Ql0w">made available in 2016</a> and now officially putting some heavy crunch into the classic tunes, along with some new <em>Doom II</em> tracks. It deserves its place in this official package, because it rips. As with almost everything else, the upgrade is optional—you can stick with MIDI if you like.</p>
<p>There are lots of accessibility options now—high-contrast text, text-to-speech in chat, and more—along with quality-of-life stuff. I was wary of having the crosshairs light up when an enemy (or barrel) would be hit, but given the sometimes unfair 2.5-D nature of the level design, and the spread of some of the bullet weapons, I'm keeping it on.</p>

<p>If all that wasn't enough for you, there's 16-player co-op and deathmatch, with cross-platform play across Steam, Windows, Epic, and GOG on PC, and on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch consoles, using room codes to connect everybody (and, it must be noted, a Bethesda account). There's even split-screen multiplayer, with up to eight people on a (very big) PC screen. Nightdive's port of the code to its KEX engine should make it easier for mods to be brought forward to this edition.</p>
<p>A caveat here that while the author is broadly aware of the many, many upgrades, mods, and other good things made possible by the open-source code and ports of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> games (including <a href="https://zdoom.org/index">ZDoom</a>), he can't say exactly how they compare to this bundle. While Bethesda and Nightdive seem to have created a space for uploading mods and levels, and keeping the basic DOS version available, it remains to be seen how they work out over the long run. If open-source <em>Doom</em> was always good enough for you, or you don't like the idea of rebundling stuff that started out in the open, by all means, save yourself the $10 here. For many, though, this is just a far easier way to get at all the good stuff now possible in demon-shooting land.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> in a while, whether sitting in your library or just $10 away now, this is too easy an excuse to check in on it again. Do it soon. Hell devours the indolent, you know.</p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 8:40 a.m. to note the potential tension of Bethesda's rebundling of Doom against its open-source community.</em></p>

                <p>Video game actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike over concerns about, among other things, artificial intelligence. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of one of the game companies in the middle of the strike, Take-Two, said recently that he's "pretty confident" the two sides can make a deal.</p><p>"We deeply value our talent relationships, and historically we worked very successfully with all of the unions, including SAG-AFTRA," Zelnick said during <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q1-2025-earning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>. "We continue to work hard to come to a resolution on this current situation. In fact, we have common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals. So, I'm pretty confident that we can get to a deal that will be mutually beneficial."</p>

<p>Zelnick went on to say that Take-Two does not expect any impact "whatsoever" for Take-Two's games that are currently in development. If the strike goes on for a long time, though, this would affect Take-Two and other companies, he said.</p><p>"We're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to find common ground, and that's certainly our goal," Zelnick said. Asked if the strike could save Take-Two money due to work stoppages, Zelnick said, "We don't get any benefit from the situation."</p><p>The strike is limited to games that began production after September 2023--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">so GTA VI is not affected</a>--while live-service games that have already been released are exempt from the strike as well.</p><p>It's not just Take-Two that's not worried about the video game strike right now. EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-ceo-isnt-worried-about-immediate-impact-from-video-game-actors-strike/1100-6525423/" data-ref-id="1100-6525423">"working diligently to negotiate at the table" and hopeful for a resolution.</a></p><p>"We don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running."</p><p>Video game voice actors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actors-have-voted-to-authorize-a-strike-if-negotiations-fail/1100-6517987/" data-ref-id="1100-6517987">voted to authorize the strike</a> last September, but only just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">initiated action as of July 26</a>, after SAG-AFTRA failed to come to an agreement with video game companies. The union has said that AI is a major sticking point in negotiations, and that it wants to ensure fair protections against AI for voice actors.</p>

The "Erotica" category includes taking shots of upskirts or cleavage.</p>

      </div>
<p>While Capcom didn't provide an explanation for the removal, it's safe to say that this decision was for the best with a game coming out in the year 2024.</p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster launches on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a physical release coming in November. This <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remastered-launches-in-september-with-some-extra-modern-features/1100-6524637/" data-ref-id="1100-6524637">remaster</a> retains the original's gameplay mechanics, while also adding in certain modern features including auto-saves, revamped controls, and improved UI.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-review/1900-6155398/" data-ref-id="1900-6155398">Dead Rising review</a>, we said, "Dead Rising's gory, ridiculous, and entertaining action, coupled with its real-time structure and campy stylistic touches, make it one of the most unique games currently available for the Xbox 360."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has released its financial report for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and it contains some encouraging news about&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>
<p>Per Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which still don't have a release window, have now entered "the full production stage", having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-remedy-production">entered the "production readiness stage" back in October last year</a>. This suggests development on the remakes is progressing pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>The report also offers an update on&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun">first announced in November 2022</a>. The upcoming sequel has entered the aforementioned "production readiness stage", according to Remedy, which means we can likely expect full production to ramp up a few months from now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FwHIS0o9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FPf1yaQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is apparently ready to enter production.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking for an update on Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <i>Codename Condor</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">may or may not end up being called&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, that's also in full production, according to Remedy.</p>
<p>All of this info comes from a financial report that also sees Remedy's revenue increasing by 33.7% year-over-year, although profits are down by around 10%, so it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Finnish studio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like things still aren't looking up for horror sequel&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, either, as the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">has yet to turn a profit</a> ten months after its release. Despite that, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says the game has "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses" at the time of the report's publication.</p>
<p>Virtala also says that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>back in May has given the studio "increased focus and better development synergies", as well as allowing it to "move experienced developers into other game projects".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=RpW5fNxs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=gVRYcChq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>still hasn't made Remedy any money, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's next for Remedy? Right now, the studio has "two games in full production" (that's the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, so it looks like Remedy is counting those remakes as one project) and one "in the production readiness stage" (i.e.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>).</p>
<p>The studio also says that since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Control</em> franchise</a>&nbsp;from 505 Games, it's able to "choose how to bring [its] future games to the market", which involves "weighing self-publishing" and "different partner publishing opportunities".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, but we'll likely get more info on the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Headsets, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals form the remainder of revenue, with all except mice being $1 billion-plus market categories. It is the Other category that will see the strongest rises to 2029, buoyed by sales of higher-value peripherals and accessories such as gamer chairs and steering wheels.</span></p><p>Source: Omdia’s Games Peripherals and Accessories Market Forecast 2024</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest data shows that global peripherals spend has kicked on from its new post-pandemic baseline, with 2023 revenue now surpassing the previous high from 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While games themselves face strong consumer resistance to price increases, there is more price elasticity for premium peripherals, with products such as PlayStation’s DualSense controller selling strongly despite costing $200+.

Its launch back in February was marked by a meteoric ascent to the top of the charts, but the past few months have been marred by controversy and upheaval that has hurt the game and the reputation of the the team behind it. As sad as it is to admit, things were always going to turn out this way, but it’s still tough seeing the place it’s landed compared to where it once was.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196299,195301" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Helldivers 2</em> couldn’t have started in a better way.

It cast players as highly replaceable pawns in Super Earth’s army, which finds itself in the middle of a “second Galactic War” against other forces vying for control of the system. It’s an inherently ridiculous premise that walks and talks like a playable version of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p><p>At first, you could only face off against the Terminids, which are a bug-like alien species that descend on players in overwhelming numbers. Soon enough though, a second front of the war manifested against an army of robots that really plunged players into the deep end. To combat those odds, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>encouraged folks to invite their friends into the fray and rendered momentous experiences from the chaos that’d ensue.</p><p>That was the real thing that I feel sold <em>Helldivers 2</em> to so many people: it seemed to love mess. The game itself ultimately proved to be a little too glitchy for its own good, but at the outset, it kind of valued this sense of incongruity and wrongness, and even spun it into a fun aspect of the game. I don’t log in to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, drop into the action to “do my part,” and feel terribly triumphant. I certainly exclaim after we successfully extract from a mission, but I walk away from these skirmishes thinking, “What the hell are we doing here? We’re getting lit up by killer robots who are thinning our literal manpower and then getting vivisected by bugs. We’re barely making it, what the fuck.” And that was an exhilarating feeling that nothing else was providing.</p><p>I spend most of my time in the game running away from all the things trying to kill me. In the meantime, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">Impalers’ tentacles are bursting out of the ground </a></span>and sending me flying. Robots are tearing me to bits. My own flying laser sentry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269">can’t distinguish between friend and foe</a></span>, often setting me on fire or slicing through an ally in an instant. My own friends will call down heavy artillery from our battleships in orbit that wind up incinerating fellow team members in order to eradicate bug nests. And when you finally extract from a nightmare of a mission, you emerge back onto the ship a bloody mess.</p><p>Things continued to look up for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for a few months. New features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710">pilotable mech suits</a></span> were woven into larger storylines playing out over the weeks. Major orders taught the community to work together toward common goals. Strategies formed, teams were decided on, and battles were fought. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481">Malevelon Creek</a></span>, a famously embattled planet in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s first months, became an almost religious site, and is now commemorated with an in-game holiday. For months, writing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> felt like writing about an entirely different beast every few weeks.</p><p>For a while there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was almost perceived as punk by the players who loved it. Here was this game that bucked every big trend, from pricing to release cadence. This game that was heavy metal and messy and audacious. It was an overnight sensation in an industry that often glorifies highly polished and sanitized experiences over something as rough and tumble as <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It was an outlier blazing some new path forward.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">Flamethrowers Were King In <em>Helldivers 2</em>, But Not Anymore And Players Are Threatening Mass Desertions</a></span></p><p>Before long though, things shifted for the worse. Suddenly, the sweeping changes that Arrowhead Studios was making all the time stopped being novel, and became more of a hindrance. Arrowhead stopped being the architects of players’ dreams and fantasies; instead they became this kind of collar around the community’s neck. Balance changes continued to drastically change the game every other week, upsetting both veteran and casual players alike. Sure, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>prided itself on being a bit of a mess, but what it really needed was some foundation that wouldn’t be eroded by an update five days later. </p><p>Everything that people championed about the game at the beginning came right back around to bite it in the ass, but how could we expect anything else? <em>This </em>is what these games do and are about. These are the incredibly fickle “models” of games that we’re inheriting and continuously propping up. By throwing your weight behind them, you tacitly approve of these kinds of shifts. For better and certainly for worse, you commit to the ups and downs of this journey.</p><p>Unfortunately the community hasn’t always seen it that way. While <em>Helldivers 2 </em>has its loving and loyal fans, video games tend to have audiences capable of immense vitriol, and <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and its developers have certainly experienced their fair share of that venom in a short time. Look no further than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login drama</a></span> that nearly ended the game, and from which Arrowhead is <em>still </em>reeling. An unforced error in judgment from the game’s publisher caused an unpopular mandate to go out which quite literally ripped the game’s burgeoning global community apart. I’m almost sure that there are <em>still </em>countries and regions in the world where <em>Helldivers 2 </em>hasn’t returned to PC storefronts because they couldn’t support PSN and were forced to pull the game.</p><p>Anyone with some sense might’ve told Sony that requiring a PSN account to play a game you bought on a different platform was boneheaded, but the move really put Arrowhead on its backfoot since it had to bear the brunt of the backlash. Due to an incredibly reckless ploy, a studio and game that requires an engaged and recurring community to stay afloat suddenly found itself on the outs through no fault of its own. The worst part is that even though Sony eventually walked back the mandate, the target on Arrowhead’s back has never really gone away, and as I wrote a few months back, it started to seem like the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">just couldn’t catch a break</a></span>.</p><p>Now, every update is met with some level of trepidation. If Arrowhead does something the community deems even remotely out of line, its fans pounce on it with an intensity I’ve rarely seen so up close. Sometimes, that means that the studio is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">heralded when popular changes are implemented</a></span>, like a balance patch that strengthened some abilities in the game over a month ago. However for every one of those patches, there are ones like the most recent update, which has once again sparked a fire under the community and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">motivating many to up and abandon the game</a></span>. I fear that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and Arrowhead are now in a vicious cycle of their own making.</p><p>It’s a shame because <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is still as great as it ever was. I’ve recently picked it up again after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major update released earlier this week</a></span>, and when you’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157">not preoccupied with being the very best player</a></span> ever, it’s still a blast unlike most anything else on the market. I just hope others wise up to that before the various forces pushing and pulling on the game and its developers undo everything that they worked so hard to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/unity-6-is-on-track-for-a-fall-2024-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a new <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Unity-Q224-Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> released this week, Unity CEO Matt Bromberg states that the upcoming Unity 6 game engine upgrade is expected to release in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>Bromberg says that Unity 6 is “on track for release this fall,” and adds that Unity believes “it will be the most stable, best-performing version we’ve ever delivered.” </p>



<p>Additionally, Bromberg reinforces that “Unity 6 is going to be the bedrock of our offering for years to come.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One analyst specifically asked about Unity’s upcoming runtime fees, the Pro transition, and any potential tier pricing changes. </p>



<p>Regarding price increases, Bromberg said that “we don’t expect to see them right away, but we do see them coming in over time.” </p>



<p>The divisive Runtime Fees apply to games created with or upgraded to Unity 6. The thresholds also include $1 million USD revenue trailing 12 months, and 1 million initial engagements. </p>



<p>In a separate <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q224-Shareholder-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shareholder letter</a> today, Unity also reported that “second quarter results exceeded guidance for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.” </p>



<p>However, the letter also mentions that revenue from Unity’s strategic portfolio was “down 6% year-over-year.”</p>



<p>Unity recently faced fan backlash, and in May 2024, reports surfaced that new Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">netted millions</a> to sign on for the role via base salary and a bonus. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous CEO stepped down</a> in October 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-eternal-modding-tool-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>id Software and Bethesda have released a new&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>update that includes a preview of the game's new modding tool, which you can use to download, organize, and play your favorite mods.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/782330/view/4328607063611272123" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the two studios say that they're "so impressed" with&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s modding community and its ability to create mods without any tools.</p>
<p>These community efforts were the inspiration behind the release of idStudio, which allows you to create and play&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, and they were also the inspiration behind the PC Mod Preview, which lets you check out the mods others have made.</p>
<p>This feature is only available on the PC versions of&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>, so you'll only be able to check it out if you're playing on Steam or the Microsoft Store. It's supported on both storefronts, though, so if you're playing on Game Pass, you can still check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=4v3uAcAK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=E_ZwDpPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>has some new modding tools for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, the idStudio beta is only available via Steam, so if you're interested in building your own&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, you'll have to be playing on the Steam version to do so. However, the mods you build can still be enjoyed by Microsoft Store players.</p>
<p>If you want to opt into the PC Mod Preview build on Steam, all you've got to do is head into&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s Properties, then select the PC Mod Preview beta from the Betas drop-down menu. You can read more about&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s shiny new modding feature <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have more to look forward to as well</h2>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>modding tools that&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have to enjoy right now, as Nightdive Studios has also stepped forward with a brand new surprise release.</p>
<p>The studio, which is behind the re-release of retro classics like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/90s-classic-shadow-man-remastered-coming-to-pc-in-april">Shadow Man</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease"><em>The Thing</em></a>, dropped remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>games yesterday as part of Bethesda's QuakeCon celebrations.</p>

<p>Available across PC and consoles, the two remasters pack in a huge amount of content, including&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Doom 2</em>, all of their expansions, and even a brand new episode created as a collab between id, Nightdive, and MachineGames.</p>
<p>In short, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fan, you're eating well right now, especially given that a brand new <em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">also on the horizon</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

Still, October will see players return to the game's Lion King realm to this time welcome Timon and Pumbaa. PlayStation owners of the game will also finally get the option to play via cross-platform multiplayer, with cross-save coming later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Our October update will be smaller in scope and shorter," Labelle wrote, "with a focus on fixes and quality of life improvements to make your game experience smoother and more enjoyable as we ramp up to a bigger update later in the year."
</p>
<p>
In "late 2024", Gameloft has teased that players will be able to "stitch a new mystery together", accompanied by the patchwork dress worn by Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas. Expect a 2025 roadmap for Disney Dreamlight Valley around the same time.

<p>
Labelle also wrote in broad terms about the future of Disney Dreamlight Valley, now nearly two years on from its original launch. In short, following fan feedback, improvements will be made to the game's furniture and wardrobe menus, as well as to provide more room for decoration in players' increasingly crowded Valleys.
</p>
<p>
"Last year, we promised to keep delivering free content updates that add new characters, Realms, clothing, furniture, and more surprises. That promise is as important today as it was then, especially when we look at new Villagers," Labelle concluded.
</p>
<p>
"Recent surveys have played an important role by providing us insight into what you'd like to see in Disney Dreamlight Valley and 2025 is already shaping up to be a year full of exciting surprises."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following a large number of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 leaks, Activision has started to issue Cease and Desist letters to Black Ops 6 leakers and host sites.</p>



<p>One of the biggest Black Ops 6 hosts was ‘PSLAN,’ who claimed that they had received a Cease and Desist letter from Activision. According to PSLAN, Activision claimed in the letter that the user was selling Black Ops 6 access for 6 euros a month and is claiming 250,000 euros in damages. As Insider Gaming reported a couple of days ago, hundreds of people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were already playing Black Ops 6</a> via PSLAN.</p>



<p>PSLAN has since removed support for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In addition to the host being issued <span>a C&amp;D, it appears that some Call of Duty leakers have also been issued similar </span>notices. Twitter user&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HeyImAlaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@HeyImAlaix</a>, who has been leaking Call of Duty for several years, has also seemingly been issued&nbsp;a C&amp;D (and not for the first time).</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that the Cease and Desists will stop the leakers from leaking Call of Duty, but for now, the flow of Black Ops 6 leaks will likely slow down. In addition to the C&amp;D, Activision has also been issuing DMCA takedowns on all Black Ops 6 content.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Brendan Depa, 18, was sentenced to five years in state prison on Tuesday for "brutally" beating a high school teaching assistant over a Nintendo Switch. The incident, which occurred on February 21, 2023, at Matanzas High School in Palm Coast, Florida, was captured on video and widely reported. Depa will also serve 15 years of probation following his release, as reported by <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/courts/2024/08/06/live-brendan-depa-florida-teen-who-beat-teachers-aide-to-be-sentenced/74671170007/" rel="nofollow ">Daytona Beach News-Journal</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa, then 17, attacked Joan Naydich after an altercation involving the gaming console. The video shows Depa assaulting Naydich in a school hallway, pushing her to the ground, and repeatedly kicking and punching her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compounding the senseless physical violence was the screaming of obscenities, spitting on Ms. Naydich both before and during the incident," Circuit Judge Terence Perkins said, also highlighting Depa's lack of remorse. "He pursued her down the hallway, pushed her so violently from behind that she flew through the air and was knocked unconscious when she landed on the hallway floor. He then proceeded to kick her, then jump on top of her, striking her in the head and body more than 15 times."</p><p dir="ltr">Depa's defense argued that his autism spectrum disorder and his mother's criticisms of the sentence should be considered. Leanne Depa claimed that the sentence was influenced by racial and disability biases and criticized the school for not managing her son's disabilities properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant State Attorney Melissa Clark argued for a substantial punishment, stating, "He almost killed a woman. He should be punished for that." Naydich, who suffers from PTSD and other long-term impacts, noted the significant personal and professional consequences of the attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa has the right to appeal the sentence but is ordered to have no contact with Naydich and to remain 500 feet away from her home and workplace.</p>

<p>Zelnick added: "I think that offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day-and-date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time."</p><p>Zelnick has been saying a version of this for years. In 2021, the executive said Take-Two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">doesn't put its major new games on subscription services at launch</a> because "the economics are much more difficult to make sense of." In 2022, Zelnick said doing this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">makes no economic sense.</a></p><p>Zelnick maintains that there are major differences between the linear entertainment (TV/film) business and interactive entertainment (video game) business, and while a subscription service may make sense for linear entertainment, Zelnick doesn't see the same viability for games.</p><p>"The interactive entertainment business is very different than the linear entertainment business. People consume far fewer hours of interactive entertainment in a given month than they do of linear entertainment," he said. "And within that consumption, there are far fewer titles consumed in interactive entertainment than there are with linear entertainment. So I, at least, pose the question as to whether subscription makes as much sense for interactive entertainment as it does for linear entertainment and registered some skepticism, which I still hold."</p><p>Launching a major new game into a subscription services is "just a lost opportunity for the publisher," Zelnick said.</p><p>Take-Two has over the years experimented with bringing its biggest games, including GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, to services like Game Pass and PS Plus. Theses games have rotated in and out of the catalogs. Zelnick has said bringing its older titles to a subscription service might make sense, but for new titles, it's not something Take-Two is looking to do.</p><p>While Microsoft launches all of its first-party games into Xbox Game Pass on day one, Sony doesn't do this with its own PlayStation Plus membership program. PlayStation's former president Jim Ryan seemed to agree with Zelnick and previously discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">this doesn't make economic sense.</a></p>

Am I talking about the <em>land</em>, which could be the island of Great Britain (the big one with England, Scotland and Wales in it), or the British Isles as a whole, which is a bunch of island that would also include both Irelands and the Channel Islands?</p><p>Confusing, right? No wonder so many Americans always get it wrong when talking about the place. It's also no wonder, then, that a lot of people not from the British Isles have no interest or capacity to learn about the differences between the peoples and regions of the place. It's probably hard enough for an American or European to remember which one Wales is, let alone the West Country, Ulster and the Midlands.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You’re Here! - Reveal Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/siT1HTSCY4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Those differences can be very important to the people who live there, though. And while some centuries-old relationships and rivalries are pretty well-known internationally--you don't need me explaining <em>Braveheart</em> to you--others might be less obvious to outsiders. Few more so than the north.</p><p>England might look like one country on the map, but for around 1000 years now--as long as it's been England, basically--it's been a country divided. There's the north, and everyone south of the north. I won't bore you with the full history here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_England" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can study that in your own time if you're interested</a>, just know that from the Viking age through to the legacies of Thatcher and Brexit, England has not been as united as it might appear from the outside.</p><p>Countries always have their differences, but what I've always found interesting about England’s divide is the way that so much of what has been defined as English culture, so much of what has represented the country in its most popular media around the world, revolves around the South, especially London. I'm going to <em>wildly </em>generalise here, but from Dickens to <em>Notting Hill</em>, the streets and accents of England as depicted on the screen tend to be those from the South. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Every “Northern” character in a musical" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8uQ7VCWOnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the north must be portrayed, it's usually as a downtrodden caricature (see: <em>The Full Monty</em> or <em>Billy Elliot</em>), or in service of a fantasy universe's hardiest and most workmanlike peoples (see: the Starks). Imagine my surprise, then, when I first discovered then spent all weekend playing <em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game Riley already covered</a> because it's "hilarious and helpful", but which I also found of huge interest because it's a game that isn't just set in the north (and developed by a small studio based in Yorkshire), it's a <em>celebration </em>of it.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em> takes the piss out of itself at every given opportunity, but at the same time there's so much love for the culture and setting that I think it's the most defining thing about the game, even more than its brilliant writing and cast of unforgettable weirdos.</p><p>The fictional town of Barnsworth feels like a <em>place </em>in the best way, in the way all great video game places do, by being simultaneously small yet huge, intimate but expansive, a place where you know everybody and every street corner but are still always finding new things. And it's a place that's unashamedly of the north. If you've played the game and wondered why there are dialect options even though the game is set in England, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Northern_England#:~:text=There%20are%20traditional%20dialects%20associated,the%20nineteenth%20and%20twentieth%20centuries." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's why</a>. Why the intro shows a region stuck in the 1950s <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/03/the-north-will-rise-again-alex-niven-book-review-thatcherism-england-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it's the modern era</a>; <a href="https://www.yorkshirehandmadepies.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why</a> it's so proud of its pies.</p><figure></figure><p>It's great! My own English family is from Birmingham and I used to live just outside Brighton–which is as south as it gets–so I feel like a bit of an outsider writing this, but my wife's family is from Hull, and they roared with laughter at just about every part of the game I showed them last week, from the voice acting to the architecture to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siT1HTSCY4g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Peans commercial</a>. The idea that a <em>video game</em> would pitch itself like this was as welcome as it was surprising to them. And seeing their reaction as locals (or at least in their case former locals) made me wish more "Western" games could be this distinctly regional (with a shoutout here to another recent example of this,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88c-k4jQB-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>A Highland Song</em></a>).</p><p>I actually meant to publish this piece earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg55we5n3xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but then events transpired</a> and a blog about a quaint northern town suddenly seemed a bit ill-timed; this was not a great moment to be exploring a game that was so enthusiastically proud of everything great about the place while the world was seeing the absolute worst of it. At my lowest point I was wondering which of <em>Thank Goodness You're Here's</em> otherwise cheerful residents could I picture <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d1yq4552no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firebombing a library in a fit of anti-immigration rage</a>.</p><p>Thankfully common sense and human decency have prevailed; as destructive as a minority of hateful bigots have been, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/07/anti-racism-protesters-fill-streets-of-english-cities-as-far-right-threat-recedes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good and normal people have banded together across England--but especially in the north, where the initial attacks made the headlines</a>--and with a series of counter-protests shown the country and the world that fascists belong in only one place: the bin.</p><p>So I got to publish this little blog about how much I love a lovely little town after all. And only had to add one caveat: if anyone in Barnsworth was going to be a fascist, it would probably be this guy:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Redemption Road's time-travelling bring-an-assault-rifle-to-a-medieval-sword-fight shooter and strategy game, Kingmakers, isn't even out yet, but it's already secured a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4339866697716610827?l=english">update</a> on Steam, the studio said it was "absolutely thrilled" that the unreleased game was "making its way to the big screen" in partnership with publisher tinyBuild and Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen - which specialises in "the adaptation of video games and other 'non-traditional' IP into film and TV" shows - was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog producer, Dmitri M. Johnson.

<p>"Over the last decade or so, alongside the bigger, fewer bets publishers have made - which has also often led to formula, to conservatism - an onward march in graphical fidelity means that a certain kind of game has become obsessed with the details.

<p>"But as a trend, it can sometimes lead people to think that blockbusters are things that are made to be admired more than anything else.

            <p>
Dragon Age developer BioWare has discussed its decision to no longer allow full control over companions during combat, in a shake-up to the series set to be seen in upcoming entry The Veilguard. 
</p>
<p>
The change has been made for several reasons, game director Corinne Busche told Edge magazine (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-let-you-control-your-companions-because-you-cant-handle-it-this-is-a-much-higher-actions-per-minute-game">GamesRadar</a>), most notably the additional options instead available to controlling main character Rook. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard "is a much higher actions-per-minute game," Busche explained. "It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn't actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character."
</p>
<p>
Another reason was that BioWare wanted to give companion characters a sense of autonomy - to feel like "fully-realised" personalities "in control of their own actions", Busche added. 
</p>
<p>
Players will still be able to trigger abilities via the activity wheel in battle, as part of The Veilguard's focus on combo-based combat. (This is something BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> introduced to fun results, where you could set off chain biotic explosions with the correct combo of abilities.)
</p>
<p>
"I will admit that, on paper, if you just read that you have no ability to control your companions, that might feel like something was taken away," Busche concludes. "But in our testing and validating with players, what we find is they're more engaged than ever."
</p>
<p>Other changes added by BioWare include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-difficulty-options-let-you-turn-off-death-and-manually-adjust-enemy-health">suite of difficulty options to let you turn off death completely</a>, if you so choose, and adjust enemy health.</p>
<p>
"Whisper it, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable</a>: it looks like BioWare is back," our Chris Tapsell wrote after going hands-on with the game. There's still no firm release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">set to arrive between 1st October and 31st December</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-specs-revealed-by-playstation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>PlayStation has revealed the PC requirements for the highly anticipated God of War Ragnarok ahead of its September 19 release date.</p><p>A breakdown on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/08/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> revealed God of War: Ragnarok will require a hefty 190GB of SSD storage. The note of SSD and not the option of SSD or HDD is important to note, considering the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart">PC port of Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> was recommended but did not require players to install the game on a solid-state drive, but opting to install the game on an HDD, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-can-ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-on-pc-match-and-exceed-the-ps5-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our sister site Digital Foundry pointed out</a>, resulted in a borderline unplayable experience.</p><p>As shown in the image below, the God of War Ragnarok is optimized to run on an array of gaming rigs, with the Minimum specs, which will have the game running at 1080p at 30FPS requiring 8GB of RAM, an Nvidia GTX 1060 or AMD RX 5500 XT as the graphics card, as well as an Intel i5-4670K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 processor. </p><p>However, Jetpack Interactive, the developer behind the PC port of God of War Ragnarok, notes that the Recommended settings are 1080p at an (average) frame rate of 60FPS, which will require 16GB of RAM, an Nvidia RTX 2060 Super or AMD RX 5700 equivalent GPU, an Intel i5-8600 or AMD Ryzen 5 3600 equivalent CPU.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/09/god-1723203503427.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Here are your PC requirements to run God of War: Ragnarok of PC. | Image Credit: PlayStation</figcaption></figure></output><p>The High, Performance, and Ultra settings were also revealed. As shown in the graphic below, the High settings bump the resolution to 1440p if your rig has an Nvidia RTX 3070 or AMD RX 6800 GPU, as well as an Intel i7-7700K and AMD Ryzen 7 2700X CPU. The Performance and Ultra settings will increase the resolution to 4K, with the differences in PC specs on the GPU and CPU front. </p><p>As the system requirements layout, all these settings will average around 30 or 60FPS and could fluctuate depending on the graphical presets and hardware in a player's computer. Fortunately, these graphical setting targets do not factor in supersampling technologies, which Jetpack Interactive confirmed that God of War: Ragnarok's PC version would support DLSS 3.7 (note any iteration of DLSS 3 requires an RTX 40-series GPU), AMD's FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3, in addition to frame generation for all these supersampling technologies. </p><p>A PlayStation Network account will also be required to play the PC port of God of Ragnarok. This trend of requiring a PSN account, even if it is in some capacity, has started to appear in more first-party PlayStation games coming to PC, such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> remaster. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=40425349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> also requires a PSN account, though only for those who wish to utilize the multiplayer features. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">In IGN's 10/10 review of the PlayStation 5 version</a>, we said: "God of War: Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look mortal by comparison."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
