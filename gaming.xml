<p>Switch 2 Title Update 2 generally focuses on graphical and visual stability along with a few bug and UI fixes. We won't say no to that, especially just under a month since its release.</p>
<p>To pick out just a few bullet points from the patch notes, Kay's movement now looks better "under certain conditions", those using GameChat should no longer experience flicker, and graphical issues where Cinematic display mode wouldn't display correctly in certain scenes have now been resolved.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74yksliz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/is-digimon-story-time-stranger-good-entry-point</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-digimon-story-time-stranger-a-good-starting-point-for-digimon.1315051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've probably seen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-time-stranger-smt-with-better-evolution-system" rel="nofollow">the buzz for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, which is out now. It's always tricky hopping on the hype train when you feel late to the party, especially since this is the seventh game in the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise (and let's not even try to count the number of <em>Digimon</em> games, TV shows, and movies you might have missed too).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're wondering whether <em>Time Stranger</em> is a good opportunity to see what these digital monsters are all about, I'm here to tell you that it's the perfect way to start. I myself have consumed pretty much no <em>Digimon</em> material before this, and I've found myself having a blast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a few challenges, sure, but for the most part, I'm on board. I'm not lost in some deep lore, and everything is presented in an easy-to-digest way. Furthermore, I'm having a blast.</p>



<h2>It's a Standalone Story &amp; A Great Introduction to Digimon&nbsp;</h2>

<p>My only real memories of <em>Digimon</em> are of some action figures of Devimon and WarGreymon I had as a kid. I didn't know that was their names at the time, and I really had no context about them. I knew of <em>Digimon</em>, but mostly in relation to <em>Pokemon</em> ("They're like Pokemon, but digital," said 10-year-old me, probably).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, I knew basically nothing about the Digital World—and <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is totally fine with that. It treats you like this is your first <em>Digimon</em> game. Even the term "Digimon" is seemingly new in <em>Time Stranger</em>'s universe, where scientists previously called them "phase electron lifeforms."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The early narrative makes everything about Digimon, like Digivolving and Converting, feel new to both the player and the main character. Even diving into the Digital World and seeing a Digimon society feels like a new development to the protagonist and the rest of ADAMAS, their organization.</p>

<p>To be fair, I might have missed some inside references or things that are obvious to <em>Digimon</em> veterans, but I don't feel like I've missed anything crucial. The story has its mysteries early on, but the mysteries feel within the bounds of what's normal for a narrative, instead of my lack of knowledge of the lore.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Is Easy to Learn, Hard to Master</h2>

<p>The gameplay in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is your fairly standard turn-based affair, so if you have experience with JRPGs, you'll have a good handle on things. What I was most worried about, however, was learning a whole new attribute system.</p>

<p><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> works on two major axes here: the data-virus-vaccine triad (to keep it simple), and then the whole slew of elements to worry about. The first set is fairly straightforward rock-paper-scissors (until it isn't, but you've got time to get used to it). And the latter is essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-v-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/definitive-persona-games-dilemma" rel="nofollow"><em>Persona</em></a>—keep trying elements until one sticks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've never played an RPG with two systems that stack multipliers on top of each other, but this one does a great job of simplifying things. Before you commit to an attack, it'll tell you your multiplier and what attributes are contributing to it, which is a nice tool that keeps things clear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's also a personality system here that affects how each Digimon grows and what special bonus trait they'll have. It gets pretty complicated pretty quickly, and optimizing your stats requires a lot of homework. However, the game is transparent about how you can impact their personalities and how those will impact their growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the gameplay is a lot easier to digest because of little quality-of-life additions like these. Clarity is key here, so learning the complex systems is as easy as possible. That only makes it easier to digest the world, lore, and narrative. Furthermore, if you get fully hooked, you have a long on-ramp before you need to start taking the systems seriously to min-max your stats.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Some Hiccups Along the Way</h2>

<p>Of course, it's not a fully smooth on-ramp to get on the Digimon highway. While the game clearly defines its systems well enough, that doesn't change the fact that it's a lot of systems to learn. It's easy to get lost in the numbers, and if you get option paralysis early, it could be too overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even simple choices like Digivolution can feel a little daunting. Unlike <em>Pokemon</em>, it isn't a linear system. Each Digimon has a handful of evolutions, and two different ones could Digivolve into the same champion-level Digimon. You can De-Digivolve whenever you want, too, but that level of options can cause choice paralysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if you're familiar with <em>Shin Megami-sona</em>, there's a similar vibe of having to play a little fast and loose with how your monsters transform. Sometimes you just have to deal with the consequences later as you're learning the ropes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will say, though, the personality system does feel the most daunting, of all the systems in the game. In the early couple hours, it didn't feel so important that it's impacted my fun, but I am starting to see it impact how I want to strategize my Digivolutions.</p>



<p>And this is a small nitpick but relevant all the same: I feel like the naming conventions and the general visual design of the Digimon is something that you'll either love or hate. Personally, I think it's absolutely ridiculous to remember names like GeoGreymon or Agumon (Bond of Bravery).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, I find that the monster designs across the spectrum to feel inconsistent and weird, and not in a flattering way. Some Digimon feels like they're from entirely different universes, while others just look plain ridiculous. That all comes down to personal taste for sure, but regardless, how much you enjoy the Digimon's designs will impact how much you enjoy the game overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, overall, <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is an absolutely stellar way to hop onto the <em>Digimon Story</em> subset of games and the <em>Digimon</em> world as whole. It's an easy way to learn about the universe, and it's a neatly wrapped package of RPG goodness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And even if you don't quite fall in love with the world and the universe, it's a rock-solid RPG system that's meaty and gratifying. It's simple enough that you can keep things a little casual, but there's enough simmering underneath to sink your teeth into.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Videogame developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> studio ZA/UM have founded what they're calling "the first recognised workplace union in the UK games industry", operating as part of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain. It's yet another twist in the tale of a once-feted development studio who are now heavily associated with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">toxic layoffs, alleged fraud and diasporic feuding</a>.</p>
<p>"The recognition process provides workers and management with a strong framework to engage and negotiate on workplace-related matters," the unionised workers announce in a <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/">press release</a>, passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/workers-at-disco-elysium-studio-za-um-have-unionized">Game Developer</a>. "A committee of elected workplace representatives will regularly meet to discuss matters brought forward by the game developers at ZA/UM and management, with the support of union officials."</p>
<p>The press release notes the past couple of year's staggering quantity of mass layoffs, commenting that "job security [is] one of the union's central focuses". It includes thoughts from Eugenia Peruzzo, organising officer of the IWGB Game Workers Union, who comments that "recognition agreements lay the groundwork for a healthy relationship between the company and workers and rebalance the scale of powers after a few terrible years for the game industry and the redundancies we have seen happening at ZA/UM lately." Peruzzo is confident that more UK videogame workers will unionise. "Rest assured that this is not a one off, but this is an avalanche in the making," she says.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">much fuller write-up of the situation on GamesIndustry.biz</a>, which includes an interview with current ZA/UM president and Private Division co-founder Ed Tomaszewski. He observes of studio management's negotiations with the emerging union "that when we did talk about it, it was clear that recognising a union was core to our values as a studio, to be providing fair working practices."</p>
<p>In the GI piece, Tomaszewski also pushes back a little against some of the accusations or "characterisations" levelled at ZA/UM by certain former staff. I imagine that said former staff will be pushing back against Tomaszewski in turn.</p>

<p>ZA/UM have lost many of the people who made Disco Elysium a hit, but according to Game Developer, they now have "almost 100" people on the books after laying off a quarter of the studio and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancelling a Disco Elysium expansion</a> early last year. Their current project is Zero Parades, a colourful espionage CRPG James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zaums-spy-thriller-zero-parades-sure-looks-like-disco-elysium-in-glasses-and-a-moustache">summarised</a> as "Disco Elysium in glasses and a moustache", adding that "it isn't always clear whether Zero Parades is inspired by Disco Elysium or beholden to it."</p><p>Many of the departed Disco Elysium staff are now working on spiritual successors of one kind or another. Over at Summer Eternal, several former ZA/UM staff including writers Argo Tuulik and Dora Klindžić are making Red Rooster, which was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-former-disco-elysium-devs-of-summer-eternal-announce-their-new-game-red-rooster-in-the-form-of-a-book">teased in curious book anthology form</a>. Longdue Games are making Hopetown, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">a psychogeogratuitous RPG which Nic summarised as "Nathan Barley on the bus"</a>; their trueblood Disco complement includes ZA/UM's co-founder Martin Luiga, plus Piotr Sobolewski from outsourcing team Knights of Unity. Dark Math Games boast of former Disco motion graphic designer Timo Albert and former ZA/UM producer and investor Kaur Kender; they're making the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-be-disco-elysium-successor-xxx-nightshift-morphs-from-an-isometric-rpg-into-a-third-person-ski-resort-murder-mystery">recently renamed Tangerine Antarctic</a>, which has a "dopamine buffet".</p>
<p>I offer this summary to the next RPS staffer to write about ZA/UM-related matters, in frail hope that the situation won't be anymore complicated by then. Oh god, I've just remembered we haven't yet found out what former Disco writer Robert Kurvitz and artist Aleksander Rostov are making at their new outfit Red Info.</p>

              <p>I’ve rather given it away with the headline there, but I couldn’t help myself. Lego’s <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/game-boy-72046">recently launched Game Boy</a> is the most extraordinarily satisfying build, with results that feel uncannily realistic. It looks and feels perfect, complete with a just-too-murky screen to thoroughly emulate the real thing.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-pre-order-commercial-nintendo-1851786845">Announced back in July</a> and immediately up for pre-order (which I did as soon as I’d written the article), the Lego Game Boy was clearly a labor of love, and in some ways a compromise for Lego given the number of bespoke pieces made just for this set. From the curved and grilled panel to the fuchsia caps for the A and B buttons, a few plastic liberties have been taken to make this such a stunning replication of the 1989 handheld. And wow, it nails every element, from the bizarrely realistic-feeling d-pad (despite being so ostentatiously a Lego cross) to the spongy A and B buttons, all made complete with the epic and satisfying “CLICK!” of the on-off switch.</p>

 <p>By my count, there are at least 12 pieces unique to this set, and wonderfully this includes a large number of pre-printed pieces with distinctive Game Boy designs and fonts. Where these would usually be stickers, Lego has saved people like me who live in fear of such operations, and I’m so very grateful. Placing stickers, especially long, thin ones, requires the steady hands of a surgeon, and not the shaky incompetent flippers on the end of my arms. Still, for those who enjoy the adrenaline rush of the completely irredeemable moments, both the game cartridges you build require a large sticker be placed.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631067" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631067"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631067">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Another aspect that makes this build so special is that—and I realize how pretentious this sounds, but it’s definitely true—the instructions are put together with wit and timing. The first thing you’re asked to build is one of the two cartridges, along with a display stand for it that contains a slot for storing the spare lenticular cards. But rather than going straight onto the second, you instead are launched into the Game Boy itself, building it from the inside out. This means that you’re constructing its green network board first, then adding the base below, before putting in the mechanisms for the buttons and the buttons themselves, and only after that’s all in place putting together its complete shell. It’s so delightful that it’s constructed just as a Game Boy would have been, and those button mechanisms are just so smart. The d-pad uses a concealed rubber tire to provide the push-back when you press it in any of its four directions, while the A and B buttons get their exact sponginess from a cunningly placed rubber band pegged around three c-arm clips. The results feel so realistic, making these super-smart tricks feel all the more remarkable.</p>

 <p>Further, it’s only after you’ve finished the main Game Boy that you realize you were unwittingly adding amazing details like a realistic-looking DC inlet at the bottom, a headphone jack on the left side, and the scrolling contrast and volume wheels. Oh, and the unexpectedly hefty click of the on-off button is still making me happy.</p>

 <p>The smart nature of the instructions is completed by ending on the second cartridge, which you then slide into the back of the Game Boy, where even here it slots in with a satisfying clunk. It’s an incredibly rewarding way to finish, and you don’t have that moment of ending with the boring fiddly bits that so often marks the finish of a Lego build. There’s no putting the side-character together, or wedging flowers on all the plant stems here; that other cartridge and both display stands are already completed, and inserting that cartridge is your final moment.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631068">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, the one criticism I have here is the last thing I thought I’d be saying, but there <em>are</em> a couple of flaky moments in the instructions. One piece type in particular is always shown such that you can’t see that it has an L-bend, and there are three or four odd moments where it obfuscates where a piece should be placed&nbsp;<em>underneath</em> what you’ve already built. Nothing disastrous, nothing I couldn’t quickly figure out, but unusual for Lego. But that’s it.</p>

 <p>OK so, I swear this is true: As I was writing this review my ten-year-old son came into my study and saw the Lego Game Boy on its Lego stand next to me on my desk. “Oh, a new device!” he said. I handed it to him, and he muttered, “Game Boy.” He’s never held a real one. “Look more closely,” I told him, and he read bits of the writing, pressed some of the buttons, and said, “What?” So I took it from him, flipped it over, removed the back panel and took out the <em>Zelda</em> cartridge, revealing some of the Lego innards. “OH, IT’S LEGO!” he declared. I switched the lenticular out and put it back together, and he exclaimed, “This is SO COOL!” So there you go, a second opinion.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631069">© Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth noting that the lenticulars are splendid. There’s the main loading screen one, which has the word “Nintendo” scroll up and down just like it should. Then there’s one for <em>Zelda</em> and one for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Land</em>, to match the two carts. The&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> one is perhaps the more disappointing, given the only movement is Zelda turning to look at Link while some V-like birds move about in the sky.&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>‘s is far better, showing Mario jump up to hit a&nbsp;? block and reveal a star, with a couple of Goombas moving below. Both only have two images, but the&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> version feels a lot more dynamic. Meanwhile, the Nintendo logo screen has seven panels, such that you get a weirdly smooth scroll. And as I mentioned up top, once they’re in the Game Boy behind the plastic screen (it’s a Lego window frame with the plastic glass inserted, repurposed), it really gives that authentic dullness that’s dramatically improved by holding it in direct light.</p> <p>I realize I’ve just totally nerded out here, and I’m good with that. I wasn’t even a proper Game Boy kid, my primary experience being a splendid summer vacation when a school friend lent me hers for a full six weeks and I just obsessed over it. But even that established a lifetime’s nostalgia for me, that’s duly met and respected by this perfect Lego recreation.</p> <p>For the quality here, and the real pleasure gained from both the build and the finished result, $60 feels like a fantastic price. I usually find Lego’s prices egregious, often offensive, but the company could have been a <em>lot</em> more greedy here and wasn’t. Yes, you could also spend $60 on a handheld device that’ll emulate every Game Boy game and more beside, but honestly, this Lego brick (pun so very much intended) just feels very special.</p>

This includes tweaks like buffing the Forgeknight Amon in general so he's as strong as the other Vault Hunters, increasing the Exo-Soldier Rafa's summons and the Siren Vex's melee power to make those builds better in the endgame, and adjusting the Gravitar Harlowe's Stasis ability to ensure it's "getting value" for you.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>While sending the Vault Hunters to the gym for strength training is the main highlight of this new update, Gearbox Software also made some other changes to the looter-shooter. This includes buffing the weekly Big Encore boss, moving Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine and altering its available offerings, and adding an auto-clearing of Borderlands 4's stale shaders to prevent performance degradation on some PCs.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launched on September 12 to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorable critical reception</a>.

While currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a> is coming--though it was delayed indefinitely--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gets-new-vault-hunter-in-early-2026/1100-6535088/" data-ref-id="1100-6535088">a new Vault Hunter joins the looter-shooter</a>'s roster in 2026.</p><p>With all of that said, you can check out the full patch notes for Borderlands 4's October 2 update down below:</p><h2>Change List</h2><h3>Weekly Activities:</h3><ul><li>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</li><li>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

			<p>Frictional Games, the studio behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/amnesia-the-bunker-walking-forward-into-the-abyss/">beloved horror series Amnesia</a> and <a href="http://wccftech.com/soma-is-a-great-horror-adventure-for-pc-ps4-but-how-do-the-2-versions-compare/">sci-fi horror game SOMA</a>, has teased its next project with a new eerie trailer simply titled 'Frictional_Next_Project.mp4.' The trailer is a series of slow zooming and panning shots of spaces, some of them seeming to be from a grand hall of sorts, others from a research lab, and others from the hidden spaces behind a wall.</p>



<p>While the shots switch from one space to another, an echo of voices chanting something quite difficult to make out adds to the atmosphere, along with its dark and moody lighting all throughout the trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmHnnvQQxaE&amp;list=RDSmHnnvQQxaE&amp;start_radio=1
</p></figure>



<p>The description for the video includes <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">a link to a website for Hotel Samsara</a>, which seems to be a fictional hotel that can be recognized from some of the shots in the trailer. There's also a space to request updates by putting in your email, which brings up an odd question, asking if you are "<em>One of many</em>" or "<em>One and only</em>."</p>



<p>It all seems like hints and clues towards what this new project will be, but a lot of players in the Frictional Games community are already pointing towards it being a new game in SOMA's universe. Community members<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15fHWr4f_nTwOzgOYJt9vzrXY3K_RioAdeOHYLAWgnp8/edit?gid=1569727250#gid=1569727250"> have even put together a spreadsheet</a> detailing what they believe to be clues pointing towards it being a new SOMA game.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll learn more about this new project soon. </p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/790658/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-console-price-hikes-notepad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-the-xbox-360-era.1314991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Microsoft first revealed that it would be giving day-one Game Pass releases to all of its own Xbox games back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16922558/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscription-future-games-microsoft-studios">in 2018</a>, it suddenly turned the subscription service into a must-have for many fans. It was lauded as “the best deal in gaming,” with memes about just how good a value Xbox Game Pass was.</p><p>But after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">massive price hike this week</a>, the top Xbox Game Pass tier is now $29.99 per month, adding up to a steep $360 a year, which is more than the $299 debut price of the Xbox Series S. It comes at a time when Microsoft is also increasing console prices and trying to convince people to buy a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder">$1,000 Xbox Ally X handheld</a>.</p><p>So, why are we suddenly in an Xbox $360 era? Microsoft obviously didn’t explain it during its announcement, but I suspect some of the price hikes are related to its costly acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>The stunning 50 percent increase has left many Xbox fans questioning the value of Game Pass. Microsoft didn’t even soften the blow with a discounted annual option, and the more affordable plans aren’t appealing as they don’t come with the main perk: day-one games. Some loyal fans think they’re <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1973431831832961089">being milked</a> dry as Microsoft moves from attract mode to extract mode for Game Pass.</p><p>This year looked like it would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">a great one for Xbox</a> and Game Pass, but now everyone is turning against them. GameStop is <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973439369680920744?s=46">mocking</a> Xbox, and even <a href="https://x.com/santadecides/status/1973449772808937523?s=46">Santa is pissed</a>. It’s inevitable that such a price jump will result in mass cancellations, particularly as price hikes are the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m25bghhcpc2a">main reason</a> people have given for unsubscribing from the service this year. Microsoft’s own account page for managing Game Pass has slowed to a halt this week, perhaps an early sign that a lot of people are trying to cancel their subscription.</p><p>And you can hardly blame them. Coupled with the price of an Xbox Series X increasing by $150 in just six months and Microsoft trying to convince everyone that a phone or a laptop is suddenly an Xbox, it’s a confusing and uncertain time for the platform.</p><p>Microsoft’s latest gaming challenges can be traced back to 2022. At the beginning of that year, the company announced a massive $68.7 billion deal to acquire Activision Blizzard, a move that has reshaped its gaming business. That same year, Microsoft also set an ambitious goal of reaching 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2030, fueled by studio and content acquisitions and a plan to expand the Xbox playerbase far beyond the console.</p><p>But the division’s fortunes started to slip later that year. <em>Starfield </em>and <em>Redfall </em>were delayed, in what Xbox chief Phil Spencer called a “disaster situation” for Game Pass. A year later, the service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">got its first price hike</a>, and Xbox console prices rose outside the US, too.</p><p>When the Activision Blizzard deal finally closed in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">late 2023</a>, even more pressure was placed on Xbox’s margins. Microsoft’s gaming business suddenly had to justify this giant acquisition through new growth, and the cost cutting and price hikes began.</p><p>Sweeping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">layoffs hit first</a> in early 2024, followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">studio closures</a>. To boost Xbox revenues, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">announced</a> that it would start bringing some Xbox-exclusive games to PS5 and Nintendo Switch. It was part of a strategy shift to grow the company’s gaming business beyond Xbox hardware, but also a final admission that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23772314/ftc-microsoft-day-two-hearing-summary-xbox-console-wars-sony-playstation-call-of-duty">lost the console wars</a>.</p><p>Naturally, Game Pass had to change, too. After months of turmoil, Microsoft hiked the price of Game Pass Ultimate last year and access to day-one console games was limited to its most expensive tier with the introduction of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241171/xbox-game-pass-standard-launch-pricing">new “standard” subscription</a>. Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271619/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-trial-suspended-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">$1 Game Pass trial</a> went away.</p><p>Microsoft now finds itself this generation’s loser, saddled by a hugely expensive acquisition, under duress from tariffs on its console hardware, and trying to find more ways to make money. A price increase to Xbox games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712371/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change-microsoft-xbox">had to be quickly reversed</a>, and now it’s Game Pass Ultimate subscribers that will have to pay up instead.</p><p>Microsoft is also increasingly looking to PC or cloud for growth, but it’s bumping the price of PC Game Pass just as it gets ready to launch the Xbox Ally handhelds with Asus. The $1,000 pricing for the top Xbox Ally X is already a clear <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">test of the appetite for pricey next-gen consoles</a>, and I have a feeling that it won’t be long until there are further PC Game Pass changes. Microsoft didn’t mention the PC Game Pass price increase in its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/">blog post</a> this week, and it feels inevitable that it’ll eventually rug pull day-one games for PC players just like it did for console subscribers last year.</p><p>The other intriguing aspect of this price increase is that Microsoft has promised that Xbox-published games will arrive on the more affordable Xbox Game Pass Premium tier within a year. The big exception is <em>Call of Duty</em> titles, which won’t be available on Premium. I wouldn’t be surprised if <em>Black Ops 7</em> preorder numbers are down this year, particularly with <em>Battlefield 6</em> on the horizon. If they are, that will be putting further pressure on Game Pass, particularly because Microsoft had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">long debate internally</a> over the revenue impacts of putting <em>Call of Duty</em> on the service.</p><p>As Microsoft pushes forward with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox Everywhere strategy</a>, the challenge of its shift to PC with next-gen consoles looms large. Everything about Xbox is changing rapidly, and the expensive era of Xbox hardware and subscriptions could leave even more fans, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/costco-stops-selling-xbox-consoles-in-uk-and-us">even retailers</a>, looking elsewhere.</p><div><p id="more-microsoft-leadership-changes"><h2>More Microsoft leadership changes</h2></p></div><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/787796/microsoft-windows-reorg-single-engineering-team-changes">unified its Windows teams</a> again this week, and <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> appointed a new CEO to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789558/microsoft-ceo-commercial-judson-althoff-internal-memo">run Microsoft’s biggest businesses</a>. Both of these changes are linked to Microsoft’s AI efforts, and are part of even more unreported changes inside Microsoft.</p><p>Windows chief <strong>Pavan Davuluri</strong>, who was just promoted to president of Windows and devices earlier this month, is now looking after all of the Windows engineering teams. This is a reversal of Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176220/microsoft-windows-reorg-business-terry-myerson-ai-cloud">splitting the Windows team</a> up in 2018, and it means the leaders of the teams for Core OS, Data Intelligence and Fundamentals, Security, and Engineering Systems all now report up to Davuluri.</p><p>“This change will increase agility and simplify our end-to-end work across Windows + Devices, as we support over 1 billion Windows customers and deliver our vision of Windows as an Agentic OS,” Davuluri wrote in an internal memo.</p><p>I think this will result in a Windows 12 release, or whatever Microsoft calls it, being even more focused on AI features. I’d be surprised if Microsoft requires an NPU for the next version of Windows, but I think most of the new features it builds will need that additional hardware to work well.</p><p>AI is also continuing to reshape the rest of Microsoft. Nadella is effectively deputizing some of his responsibilities so he can focus more on technical and engineering work. <strong>Judson Althoff</strong>, who led Microsoft’s global sales organization for the past nine years, is now Microsoft’s new CEO of commercial business. He will also be responsible for the operations and marketing teams that help sell Microsoft’s software and services to businesses, but not the engineering teams that help build them.</p><p>Althoff has just returned from an eight-week sabbatical, and many Microsoft employees had presumed he would be leaving the software giant instead of taking on an expanded role. Althoff will still report directly to Nadella, but I can’t help but feel like Nadella’s delegation is similar to when cofounder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> stepped down as CEO and took on a chief software architect role instead. It’s not the same situation, but the parallels are there.</p><p>Microsoft is also reshuffling some of the engineering teams responsible for Azure and its cloud work. The Microsoft 365 engineering teams responsible for Microsoft’s core collaboration and communications tools are moving from <strong>Rajesh Jha</strong>’s experiences and devices team to <strong>Scott Guthrie</strong>’s cloud and AI organization. The security teams responsible for identity, network access, and Microsoft Threat Protection are also moving from the Microsoft Security division to Guthrie’s org. The Azure Core team is also picking up some groups from experiences and devices.<br>Microsoft is consolidating a bunch of teams responsible for its sovereign and specialized clouds into a single team within cloud and AI that will be led by <strong>Douglas Phillips</strong>. This cloud work is key for Microsoft, particularly as many of its lucrative enterprise and government contracts rely on Azure security being the best it can be. “In a time of radical technological transformation and a high-threat landscape, it is crucial to continue bringing teams closer together to optimize how we operate,” Philips wrote in an internal memo this week.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft embraces OpenAI rival Anthropic to improve Microsoft 365 apps. </strong>Microsoft brought Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.1 AI models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784392/microsoft-365-copilot-anthropic-ai-models-feature">to its Microsoft 365 Copilot last week</a>. It’s a move that expands model choice beyond just OpenAI’s range of models in Microsoft 365 Copilot, and it will allow Microsoft’s customers to access Anthropic models in Researcher and Copilot Studio. </span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft launches “vibe working” in Excel and Word. </strong>Microsoft followed the launch of Anthropic models in Microsoft 365 Copilot by announcing a new Office Agent this week that is also powered by Anthropic AI models. It can create full PowerPoint presentations or Word documents from a chat prompt. Microsoft is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/787076/microsoft-office-agent-mode-office-agent-anthropic-models">launching an Agent Mode in Office apps</a> like Word and Excel that’s a more powerful version of the Copilot experience that Microsoft has added to its Office apps. Agent Mode essentially takes a complex task and breaks it down with planning and reasoning that you can follow. It’s like watching an automated macro in real time, showing everything it’s doing in the sidebar. Microsoft is calling these new agentic features in Office “vibe working,” a nod to vibe coding, in which novices write apps by creating a simple AI prompt.</span></li><li><span><strong><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></strong><strong> is set in Japan and arrives in 2026. </strong>The Xbox Tokyo Game Show stream last week delivered a teaser trailer for the next installment in the <em>Forza</em> franchise. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785486/forza-horizon-6-japan-xbox-release-date"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> will be set in Japan</a> and is releasing in the same year Microsoft is releasing <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster, and Playground Games’ <em>Fable</em>. A PS5 version of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is also coming “post-launch.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is coming to PS5 in December. </strong>Sony revealed during its State of Play last week that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/785181/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> is debuting on PS5 later this year</a>. Asobo Studio, the developers behind the game, are also working on PS VR2 support. The PS5 version of <em>Flight Simulator 2024 </em>will even include communications from air traffic control towers playing through Sony’s DualSense controller speaker. <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> arrives on PS5 on December 8th.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft forced to make Windows 10 extended security updates truly free in Europe. </strong>Windows 10 end of support is approaching in less than two weeks, and Microsoft has now been forced to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785544/microsoft-windows-10-extended-security-updates-free-europe-changes">make its extended security updates truly free</a>, without a catch, in certain markets in Europe. When Windows 10 goes end of support on October 14th, some European customers will no longer be required to turn on Windows Backup to enroll into its Extended Security Updates (ESU). Microsoft had wanted everyone to turn on Windows Backup to get the extra year of security updates, but thanks to pressure from the Euroconsumers group this is now changing in the European economic area. You’ll still need to sign in with a Microsoft account though, but at least Windows 10 users in Europe can avoid going over the 5GB of free storage on OneDrive by not having to enable Windows Backup.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft opens the doors to more AI-powered Windows apps. </strong>Microsoft has now officially launched its Windows ML platform, making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785631/microsoft-windows-ml-ai-apps-availability">easier for developers to add AI to their Windows apps</a>. Developers including Adobe, McAfee, and Topaz Labs are now working on adopting Windows ML, allowing apps like Adobe’s Premiere Pro and After Effects to use a local NPU for semantic search, audio tagging, and scene edit detection features.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft blocks the Israeli military from some cloud and AI services. </strong>Microsoft is blocking the Israeli military’s access to cloud and AI services that have been used in the mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785733/microsoft-block-israeli-military-cloud-ai-services-palestine-protests">announced the decision in an internal memo to employees last week</a>, after <em>The Guardian</em> and others reported last month that the Israeli government stored recordings and data on Azure of up to “a million calls an hour” made by Palestinians. The block applies to a “set of service” used by a unit within Israel’s Ministry of Defense, and doesn’t affect other contracts that Microsoft holds with the Israeli government. It comes after more than a year of pressure on Microsoft to properly review its contracts with the Israeli government, and multiple protests during the company’s 50th anniversary and Build developer conference. Former Microsoft employees even set up encampments at the company’s headquarters last month and even managed to gain access to a company building and livestream themselves inside the office of Microsoft president Brad Smith.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Photos will soon auto-categorize your pictures. </strong>Microsoft is testing a new way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/786837/microsoft-photos-ai-auto-categorize-test">sift through the clutter of your photo library in Windows 11</a>. If you own a Copilot Plus PC then a new AI-powered feature on the Photos app that will place images of receipts, screenshots, identity documents, and handwritten notes in their own folders. It sounds like one of Microsoft’s more useful implementations of AI in Windows 11.</span></li><li><span><strong>Trump’s new target: Microsoft head of global affairs. </strong>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/786885/trump-calls-for-firing-microsoft-lisa-monaco">wants Microsoft to fire</a> its head of global affairs, <strong>Lisa Monaco</strong>. Trump claims that Monaco, who only started at Microsoft in May, is “corrupt,” “deranged,” and “a menace to US national security.” Trump claims Monaco’s role at Microsoft lets her access “highly sensitive information,” and that he’s already stripped Monaco of security clearances. Monaco worked as the 39th Deputy Attorney General of the United States under President Biden and AG Merrick Garland. Garland was in charge of the federal prosecution of Trump.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s Windows 11 2025 update is available now. </strong>Microsoft started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/788167/microsoft-windows-11-version-25h2-download-insta">rolling out its annual Windows 11 update</a> (known as version 25H2) this week. Because 25H2 has a shared code base with 24H2, it means there aren’t any immediate new features. That also makes it a small update that’s delivered as a simple “enablement package.” Microsoft will continue to deliver new features to both 24H2 and 25H2 on a monthly basis.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is giving Copilot AI faces you can chat with. </strong>After experimenting with a floating blob as a Copilot character, Microsoft has now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/788741/microsoft-copilot-labs-ai-portraits-experiment-human-avatar">turned to human-looking avatars instead</a>. A new experimental “Portraits” feature in Copilot Labs includes 40 stylized human avatars that respond with natural expressions during real-time voice conversations. Microsoft is using its VASA-1 technology to power this feature, and after trying it briefly it’s the sort of feature Microsoft will have to be careful with — particularly given the concerns around harmful interactions with character-driven AI chatbots.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox Cloud Gaming comes out of beta with improved 1440p resolution. </strong>Alongside the price hikes to Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft also revealed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789461/xbox-cloud-gaming-launch-1440p-resolution-bitrate-changes">Xbox Cloud Gaming is finally coming out of its preview state this week</a>. It has been in beta since its launch in 2020, and the full release now includes 1440p resolution and improved bitrate for select games and devices. This new resolution support is limited to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, and Microsoft is also bringing cloud access to its Essential and Premium tiers.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Excel turns 40. </strong>Microsoft <a href="https://www.threads.com/@mckoss/post/DPNc_q5kaxb">originally launched</a> Excel for the Mac in September 1985. It was a time when GUI was replacing the command line, and PCs were starting to get more accessible. Lotus dominated the spreadsheet market with its Lotus 1-2-3 product, but that didn’t stop Microsoft from taking over the spreadsheet market for the past four decades. Excel is so popular now that there’s even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24133822/microsoft-excel-spreadsheet-competition-championship">competitive world championship held in Las Vegas</a> each year for spreadsheet experts.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft 365 Premium bundles Office and AI for the same price as ChatGPT Plus. </strong>Microsoft is finally combining its Microsoft 365 Family plan with Copilot Pro into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789493/microsoft-365-premium-features-pricing">a new Microsoft 365 Premium subscription</a>. Priced at $19.99 a month, it’s the same price as OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus subscription and offers the highest usage limits in features like GPT-4o image generation and voice, as well as Copilot Podcasts, Deep Research, Vision, and Actions. Unlike ChatGPT Plus, it will also include all of the Microsoft 365 Family benefits, with access to Office desktop apps for six people, 1TB of storage per person, and more. Microsoft is also allowing Microsoft 365 Personal, Family, and Premium subscribers to bring their Copilot license to work, and enable Microsoft 365 Copilot in their Office apps.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Office icons are more curvy and colorful. </strong>Microsoft is officially unveiling its new Office icons this week, after they leaked earlier this year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789533/microsoft-office-new-icons-design">The icons have a modern design that’s more colorful and playful</a>, with subtle changes that match Microsoft’s recent work with its Fluent illustrations. All of Microsoft’s 10 core Office icons are being refreshed, with a focus on gradients of color that improve contrast and accessibility. I think the new icons look great, and they’re rolling out in the coming weeks across web, desktop, and mobile for both consumers and commercial users of Microsoft 365.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s Windows XP Crocs are here. </strong>I first revealed the Windows XP Crocs were coming in August, after employees were able to purchase them for $80. Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789982/microsoft-windows-xp-crocs-launch">Microsoft has made them official</a> and revealed its holding a sweepstakes for anyone to win a pair. The Crocs have a design inspired by Windows XP’s Bliss wallpaper, and have Clippy and Internet Explorer shoe charms. It doesn’t look like Microsoft will be selling them though, so if you want a pair you’ll have to enter the competition and cross your toes.</span></li><li><span><strong>Halo Studios plans “deep dive” on what’s next for Halo. </strong>After a tease of Halo Studios’ Unreal Engine plans for <em>Halo </em>last year, it now looks like we’re about to hear more about where Halo is heading next. <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/09/30/halo-studios-plans-deep-dive-on-whats-next-for-halo/">Halo Studios is now teasing</a> a “deep dive” panel about what it’s been working on during the Halo World Championship Series event later this month.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-nicktoons-game-dice-destiny-diablo-like-for-kids-parents-review-arpg-2000631055</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-nicktoons-game-is-a-great-diablo-like-game-anyone-can-enjoy.1314982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So Timmy Turner from <em>Fairly OddParents</em>, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Leonardo from <em>TMNT</em> are all in a game together, and no, I’m talking about <em>Fortnite</em>. Not this time. Instead, these and other Nickelodeon cartoon characters are part of <em>Dice of Destiny</em>, a newly released action RPG that plays a lot like <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">Baby’s First <em>Diablo</em>,</a> which might be the perfect game for parents and kids to enjoy together. Just don’t go in expecting something deep, difficult, or long.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/nicktoons-and-the-dice-of-destiny"><em>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny,</em></a> out now on consoles and PC, is very much a <em>Diablo</em>-like ARPG that removes all the blood and demons and replaces them with famous cartoon characters and family-friendly enemies to smack around over the course of the game’s six- to eight-hour campaign. Like Blizzard’s popular ARPG,<em> Dice of Destiny</em> is played from a top-down isometric perspective and features lots of gold to collect, loot to find, and new skills to unlock to better kill all the hundreds and hundreds of fish men, robots, evil books, jellyfish, and even big bosses who want to stop our heroes from collecting powerful dice that will let them escape this fantasy world they are trapped in.</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-action-rpg-blizzard-torchlight-path-of-exile-1850506636/6"><em>Dice of Destiny</em> doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to ARPGs</a>. You’ll feel right at home with the combat, movement, and progression if you’ve played a <em>Diablo</em>, or a <em>Titan Quest</em>, or even a <em>Path of Exile.&nbsp;</em>You enter areas filled with enemies to kill, find some loot and gold, perhaps stumble upon a side challenge or hidden chest, level up, and then return to a hub area to sell loot and tinker with your character and inventory. Yeah, you’ve played this game before. You know how this goes.</p>

 <p>And to <em>Dice of Destiny’</em>s credit, it plays very well and runs like a dream on my Xbox Series X. Sadly, combat isn’t challenging, even when I turn the difficulty up before entering a mission. At least the different biomes you visit, each inspired by Nickelodeon shows like <em>SpongeBob</em>, look wonderful, with a vibrant art style that pops on a big 4K TV. You might get a bit bored fighting the same enemies and getting little loot for it, but at least it all looks nice and runs well, which is not something I can say for other <a href="https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588">Gamemill-published titles.</a></p>

 <p>Sadly, where <em>Dice of Destiny</em> sort of falls apart is that all the playable characters lack skill trees. Combine that with a lack of loot drops and you start to wonder why you’re grinding away through all the missions. Characters also level up so fast that after a few missions, I was well beyond the level of later missions and felt nearly invincible outside of boss fights. It leads to the game lacking any meaningful RPG progression, and I went from a weakling to a powerful murderer in no time. While I found this to be disappointing, as it meant an already easy game became even easier, I can see how kids would appreciate the ability to level up quickly and acquire new powers to use.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631080">©Gamemill</figcaption></figure> <p>I think for most people who regularly read <em>Kotaku</em>,<em> Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</em> will be a boring and somewhat shallow ARPG adventure through some gorgeous cartoon worlds that will make you want to reinstall <em>Diablo IV.</em>&nbsp; But if you have a young kid who’s getting into video games and wants to play an RPG, this is probably a perfect choice. It’s very likely they will know at least some of the characters in <em>Dice of Destiny,</em> and the lack of a skill tree and the game’s reluctance to drop loot or flood the screen with baddies makes it a relatively kid-friendly experience, especially if this is one of their first “big” games. And there’s just enough depth and action here that parents playing with their kids in co-op, which the game supports locally, won’t be bored to tears.</p> <p><em>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</em> is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. I’d recommend waiting for it to drop in price during a sale, as the $50 sticker slapped on this thing is a bit too high for what’s on offer here. But hey, maybe your kid (or you) really wants to kill 200 jellyfish as Jimmy Neutron? If so, run, don’t walk, to <em>Dice of Destiny</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-shows-you-the-memories-of-npcs-you-kill-and-it%E2%80%99s-hilarious.1314979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A lot of games play with the idea of guilting the player for their actions. Sometimes it’s choice-based games in which your decisions can potentially result in the deaths of companions, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-best-character-squadmates-garrus-liara-tali-1851693416"><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i></a> <span>series, or it’s something like </span><i><span>Spec Ops: The Line, </span></i><span>which makes you sit with the dire consequences of the war crime you committed. Blurbs, a content creator on YouTube and Twitch who creates mods for games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i></a><span>, decided to take this a step further by giving every NPC in Rockstar’s open-world western memories of their own that play out if you kill them. While this mod could have turned </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span> into a 50-hour guilt trip, Blurbs gave it some levity by letting his Twitch chat submit the monologues that he would hear after gunning someone down. The results are chaotic.</span></p>  <p><span>Blurbs tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that the original idea was to make players feel guilty for committing acts of wanton violence against the citizens of </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span>, but once Twitch chat got involved, it went “off the rails.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I mean, really, who even thinks about the non-story characters ever?” Blurbs said in an email. “It felt like an interesting thought experiment to give these characters past lives and to be forced to take ownership of your actions.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Before chat submitted captions, a lot of these memories made your actions tragic by reminding you that these people you slaughtered had rich, full lives that they’ll never get back to, like a man remembering his newborn child, a couple reflecting on their marriage, or a guy hanging out with his dog. Things got silly, however, when viewers submitted text to go along with the scenes, which was put through a text-to-speech service to play over the memories those characters relive in the instant before death after protagonist Arthur Morgan takes them out. Blurbs didn’t read them before implementing them into the mod, and says that Twitch’s automated mods helped avoid any “bad actors” who might have submitted something untoward.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My favorites were the really absurd ones like explaining </span><i><span>Rick &amp; Morty</span></i><span> to a baby, the guy barking at his own dog, or the man trying to subconsciously make his baby a Mets fan,” Blurbs said. “I can usually count on my Twitch chat to do a good job coming up with ridiculous voice lines.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The YouTube video about the mod above is the latest in a series in which Blurbs tries to bring mod ideas suggested by his chat to life. Typically, several of these are all put into one video, but Blurbs tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> this one “warranted its own video” because it was such an involved process.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It could’ve been just a plain textbox with an NPC’s life summary, but my whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he said.</span></p> <p><span>Blurbs has gotten his Twitch chat involved in other projects as well, including the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3RJ2gkfPJI"><span>“Text-to-Skyrim”</span></a><span> mod that lets viewers write dialogue for NPCs in </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></i><span>. He also has upcoming projects based on </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> and the </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> series.</span></p>

		<p>Sometimes you need to turn your brain off, to step away from an endless stream of email chains, the daily struggle against the commuting tide, or incessant supermarket trips to refill the fridge. Games used to be panacea to your troubles, but many have become so complicated, filled with hand-wringing drama or tedious busy work, that they no longer fulfil their role as an escape from the real world. Devolver Digital are a publisher you can still rely on for experiences outside of the status quo though, and with Ball X Pit, they’re giving you one unlike any other.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL x PIT | Available October 15 | Wishlist and Demo NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB5v8BAn97Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that needs instinct. It’s a hellish combination of block-dropping, old-school Space Invaders blasting, pinball, Breakout, town building and tower defence with the framework of a roguelike implanted across it all. Coming across it in a faux-traditional Japanese street lodged inside the voluminous Tokyo Game Show floor was as refreshing as standing underneath the overworked air-con units, and when I left at the end of the blistering day, it was the first game that kept coming back to tickle my mind.</p>


<p>Ballbylon has fallen. This fated city has been destroyed, leaving a gaping maw in the Earth through which adventurers and fortune seekers have decided to set forth. This is the eponymous Pit, and it’s filled with legions of hellspawn who seem set on escape, and chewing you up on the way there.</p>


<p>Your adventurer strides forth from the bottom of the screen as wave after wave of demons and skeletons make their inextricable advance towards the bottom of the screen. Each unit is pulled into blocks – a bit like old-school Warhammer – with single blocks taking fewer hits to send back to hell, while anything larger has vast stores of health for you to whittle down, while launching projectiles at you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you have plenty of projectiles of your own. This is where the Ball part of the name comes in, with your adventurer capable of firing several simple balls that ricochet off enemies and the edges of the Pit. Hit the enemies, break them down and move onto the next. Simple, right?</p>
<p>It might start out straightforward, but Ball X Pit thrusts options and upgrades at you with alarming regularity. Collecting the resources dropped by fallen creatures levels up your adventurer, and each time you level up, you’re given a trio of choices, unlocking new types of ball, or AOE attacks, or upgrading those you already have. These, in turn, have various special effects, and you’ll launch balls that cause enemies to bleed out, before they’re then electrocuted and subsequently poisoned.</p>

<p>There’s a whirlwind mix of offensive options, and it’s going to take a long time for players to settle in and discover how each of the weapons works and how it then interacts with the other armaments you’ve got equipped, but once you get the right run and the right setup, you can become the bringer of ball-based death.</p>
<p>Fusion makes that even more complicated. Finding the glowing rainbow icon from a fallen foe, you’re then given the option of fusing two of your current weapons to create something new. This can, to a certain extent, reset your offensive abilities, and you’re then thrust back into whatever situation you were in with a wholly new mechanic to deal with. I’m sure that as players become more used to the possible outcomes of Fusion, they’ll be able to pull out the best outcome, but here in the demo, it left me frantically back-pedalling as I tried to get used to the new options.</p>
<p>Once any of your weaponry has reached its maximum level, you can also perform an Evolution that further magnifies the unbelievable ball-bouncing, becoming a race between yourself and the residents of the Pit to become the most powerful. It’s such a wild, heady mix, and as you descend further into the pit, the walls of the arena expand further, once again changing your tactical options, on your way to facing off against each areas immense boss.</p>

<p>I didn’t get chance to check out the town-building aspect of the game, but it’s a totally new way to frame the standard repetition of Roguelike progression. You collect various resources like wood and wheat through each run, using them to build new facilities in your town that then grant you bonuses or unlock additional characters, hopefully helping you towards an even better run next time.</p>
<p>I can’t get over how far Ball X Pit has sunk itself into my psyche. It manages to be immediately approachable, while steadily layering on a host of new ideas and features to create something entirely its own.<br>
<em><br>
Ball X Pit releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PC and Nintendo Switch 2 on the 15th of October.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="359d1c7cb03bc"><a title="Sonic CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359d1c7cb03bc/sonic-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/54299">Famitsu</a> has published the latest boxed charts for Japan, and we've got a few newcomers this week to mix up the top ten.</p>
<p>In pole position is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> for the PS5, which starts strong with 57,475 units sold. Not too far behind, however, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, adding another 35,027 to its running total. In fact, the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> couldn't keep up with Nintendo's kart racer, and lands at number 9 with 5,571 units sold.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Sonic's appeal in Japan isn't quite on par with Western audiences, and it's equally just as likely that folks are simply waiting for the Switch 2 version, which is due to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> also makes its debut, with the Switch version beating the PS5 version to sell 10,425 copies in its launch week.</p>

        <p>Definitely no massive security disaster brewing there, nope</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It must have been a stressful few days for Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-reveal-massive-game-pass-ultimate-and-pc-pass-price-hike-concede-that-price-hikes-are-never-fun">Game Pass changes nobody likes</a>, admitting the first Xbox-branded handheld <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-prices-arent-too-bad-in-the-uk-but-tariffs-bite-in-the-us">costs a thousand bucks</a>, having to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">tell the Israeli military</a> that they need to see other people. Yeesh. No wonder they’re so intent on blowing off steam by taking a scythe to Windows 10 security updates this month, a move that will effectively end official support for the operating system.</p>
<p>With previous Windows version cutoffs, this would have been standard circle-of-life stuff. One system perishes, another is nourished with its bone meal. Except Windows 10 remains in use by millions of PC owners and players, mere days before its scheduled slaying on October 14th.</p>
<p>The exact proportion depends on who you ask, but it’s always a chunky one. The most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam hardware survey</a> puts Windows 10 usage at 32%, showing a strong affinity for the older OS even while most respondents (63%) are on Windows 11. Meanwhile, per <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/windows_10_statcounter/">The Register</a>, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202408-202509">Statcounter</a>’s random sample of assorted web users suggests that just over 40% of all PCs have stuck with Windows 10. That’s barely behind the Windows 11 figure of 49%.</p>
<p>By comparison, Windows 8 and 8.1 merely accounted for 4% of PCs shortly before they had their security updates binned in January 2023, according to Statcounter. So there’s evidently something unusually compelling about Windows 10 – or, perhaps, something offputting about Windows 11 – that’s keeping it disproportionately popular in its final hours. I’ll attest to that, actually. While, as current custodian of the RPS Rig, I’ve long had it running the latest version, I remain too accustomed to the Win10 interface to budge from it on my personal PC.</p><p>Sadly, there’s more to this than UI comparisons and market share pie charts. As The Reg point out, it’s one thing to leave unpatched security vulnerabilities on a handful of weirdo Windows 8 holdouts, and another thing entirely to wilfully put millions upon millions of Windows 10 users at risk. For an example of the kind of weakness that would go unfixed, this past June, Microsoft were forced to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/a-worrying-windows-secureboot-issue-could-let-hackers-install-malware-heres-what-we-know-and-whether-you-need-to-update">close a Secure Boot vulnerability</a> that would allow malware wielders to disable your PC's other security tools before seizing control of the OS. That's the same Secure Boot, of course, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> are making a mandatory system requirement.</p>
<p>There may be other, less dire but more widely-spread consequences, too. Capcom, for instance, recently warned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">multiple recent Monster Hunter games might cease to work</a> on Windows 10 after the 14th.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be surprising to see a last-minute tilt towards Windows 11, as users realise they’ve run out of procrastination time. I’ll be switching over myself, though that’s mainly because I use this rig for work and Ian Games Network said I had to. If you’re determined to stand by Windows 10, the closest thing to a concession that Microsoft will offer is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/extended-security-updates?r=1">Windows 10 ESU</a> (Extended Security Updates) programme, where you can get a year of extra updates for free, no strings attached, if you live in the European Economic Area. If not, you can still enrol by either a) backing up your Windows 10 PC, b) spending 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, whatever those are, or c) just bunging Microsoft your local equivalent of $30 USD in cash. No, that is not a joke. Well, in a sense it is. Just not the funny kind.</p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just shot up another 50%, jumping from $20 to $30 per month. Folks are canceling subscriptions left and right with reports of the web page to change you Microsoft subscription plan going down due to overwhelming traffic. $30 every month for a service is a bad price. Microsoft should know better, but not all of their services are that excruciating on your wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for just $10. StackSocial has it marked down from $199 by 94% for a limited time.</a> It’s a one time upgrade too. No subscription, just pay for the license once and you got it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro offers a whole slew of new security features and an updated UI designed for multitaskers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>New Features to Maximize Your Productivity</h2>
<p>Universal Search has been added to the taskbar. This new tool allows you to search for anything, pretty much anywhere. Doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a specific file on your computer or need a recipe or directions from the internet, the search will look through all systems to pull up precisely what you need — all with just one search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro gives you OneDrive support. You can synchronize preferences and files across your different devices, accessing them from anywhere. Say an urgent email comes through in which you need to reply to immediately with an attachment. Or perhaps you forgot to submit the paper you wrote, but now you’re sitting in class without your laptop. You can pull up OneDrive on your phone and submit from there. Easy-peasy. It’s a great tool to have while traveling too.</p>



<p>Desktop is a terrific, albeit a poorly-named feature. Like c’mon. Desktop already has a definition. Use something new. Anyway, ‘Desktop’ allows you to set up customized workspaces on your PC. Tailor your wallpaper, shortcuts, logins, widgets, and more for your different needs. Have one set up for gaming, another for student activities, perhaps another for a side hustle. You can then easily swap between them right at the taskbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Windows 11 Pro has built-in all sorts of keyboard shortcuts you may not know about</a>. Have you ever used Win + V? It’s kind of like Ctrl + V on steroids. Instead of just pasting the last thing you copied, it will pull up your clipboard and history of all your recent copies. This is a complete game change for any workflow that requires a lot of copying and pasting, like if you need to move multiple bits of info into a form you’re filling out or perhaps a spreadsheet. No need to flip back and forth between your tabs, copying and pasting one item at a time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tekken-the-board-game-preview.1314940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy a good bout in a fighting game from time to time, with Bandai Namco’s Tekken being my favorite 3D fighter out there. Conveniently enough, I am also a fan of board games, so when these two passions of mine mingle with one another, such as with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-the-board-game-review"><u>Guilty Gear Strive</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-v-champion-edition-legends-board-game-review"><u>Street Fighter V</u></a> board games, I make sure to check them out. Now, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign over on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gamefound</u></a>,  it’s time for the King of Iron Fists to enter the cardboard ring with Tekken: The Board Game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is made by Go On Board, the publisher of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-old-world-board-game-review">The Witcher: Old World</a> and <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberpunk 2077- The Board Game</a> among others. I've had a chance to get some rounds in with a prototype of Tekken: The Board Game, graciously sent to me by the developer, and I have to say, it may have nailed the feeling of “reading your opponent” in a fighting video game better than any other board game I’ve played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Tekken, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> (the final release will include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> and optional tournament expansion for up to eight) pick from their favorite fighters and duke it out until one player's life is gone. Characters I got to try out and that will be included in the base game are Jin, Kazuya, Paul, King, Nina, Asuka, Yoshimitsu, and Jack-8, each coming with detailed minis featuring the character and a pretty nifty colorful accent. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview4-1759244881410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing a match of Tekken feels a bit like a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, and is fairly quick to pick up and learn. Matches are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">short</a>, too, taking 10 to 15 minutes. Attacks are dictated by cards that you play in front of you, which show not only the area they are targeting, either high, mid, or low, but also the effects and damage the attack will do, indicated by icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any given time, only one person is on the offense, laying out cards and trying to dish out damage. The idea behind this system is born out of the need to keep Tekken feeling fast and dynamic, Go On Board told IGN. “To truly capture the dynamic feeling of the video game, we needed a mechanic that keeps the fight fast-paced and full of tension. In Tekken, reading your opponent’s intentions and reacting at the perfect moment is crucial – blocking a key attack can break a combo and turn the tide of battle. The 'guess the right card' mechanic embodies that essence. It’s simple and intuitive, like pressing a button on a controller, but mastery comes from deeply understanding your opponent and predicting their moves. It’s all about timing, reading, and skill – just like in the original game.”  </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview7-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For the defending player, your only goal is to read the opponent and try to guess which area the attacker’s card is going to target, indicated by a card played face down in front of them. Guessing correctly will stop the attack in its tracks, and the defending player becomes the attacker, with their first attack being unblockable. Guessing wrong, however, not only will let the attack go through and connect, but the player who played the card continues their assault and is able to play another card, extending their combo and potentially triggering added bonuses based on their character's specific combos or how lanes on cards may line up with the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only three attacks can happen before roles reverse, with the exception of a once-per-game HEAT action that each player can take, which allows one additional attack to be played, or lets the player continue attacking after a correct guess by the defensive player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This element of trying to read your opponent to guess what they are going to do next is an intrinsic part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-fighting-games">fighting video games</a>. Having it condensed in such a way to a one-in-three chance to guess correctly works shockingly well. The actions that an attack can trigger are also rather straightforward: you can deal damage, move your character, push an opponent, or sweep an opponent, causing them to fall down, letting you deal extra damage. Your character’s special Rage attack is a bit more complicated, but my friends and I never felt overwhelmed. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview3-1759244881410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken also uses mechanics that make it feel like you’re playing, well, Tekken. Pushing an opponent into the wall causes a wall bounce, dealing damage. You can break through stage walls or floors into other areas and dish out that extra hurt on the ground. Even the small arenas you fight on feel very Tekken-like, giving you enough space to move around, but not so much that it turns reaching your opponent into a chore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken has never been about playing keep-away and hurling fireballs at one another; instead it's about getting in close and letting loose devastating punch-and-kick combos, and I think Go On Board has captured that spirit perfectly. “Each fighter in Tekken: The Board Game feels truly unique thanks to a combination of design elements. Each character has a distinct deck composition, combo structure, and a Rage ability that reflects their iconic playstyle from the video game. Some characters also feature unique components or mechanics that set them apart even further.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview6-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When the game comes out, fighters will have a variety of ways to check out Tekken and prove themselves. The core box contains eight fighters (Jin, Kazuya, King, Paul, Jack-8, Yoshimitsu, Asuka, and Nina) and four stages (Sanctum, Urban Square, Descent into Subconscious, and Into the Stratosphere). Or, if you just want a taste, a starter set featuring Jin and Kazuya and the Descent into Subconscious will also be available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But any Tekken fan knows that one of the defining aspects of the series is its characters, and Go On Board is bringing many of them over through various expansion sets that you can purchase separately, too. These include the following.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 1</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Jun, Leroy, Xiaoyu, Panda</li><li>Stage: Yakushima</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 2</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Heihachi, Reina, Lee, Kuma</li><li>Stage: Secluded Training Ground</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 3</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Azucena, Leo, Lili, Shaheen</li><li>Stage: Ortiz Farm</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 4</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Lidia, Eddy, Victor, Raven</li><li>Stage: Seaside Resort</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 5</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Lars, Alisa, Claudio, Zafina</li><li>Stage: Rebel Hanger</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 6</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Hwoarang, Law, Steve Fox, Feng</li><li>Stage: Arena</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 7</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Dragunov, Bryan</li><li>Stage: Midnight Siege</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“Legendary” Expansion</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: True Ogre, Mokujin</li><li>Stage: Tekken 3 Stage “Carnival”</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked about what went into deciding the character pairings, the design team not only wanted to make sets that played well together, but also ones that made sense from a narrative standpoint. “When creating the character packs, we took into account several key aspects. We wanted each box to include characters that work well together mechanically, but also share meaningful narrative connections. For example, the pack featuring Jun, Xiaoyu, Panda, and Leroy with the Yakushima board was designed this way because Yakushima is Jun’s stage. Xiaoyu once fought off the Jacks units attempting to reach the Sanctum near Yakushima, while Panda is Xiaoyu’s close friend, and Leroy served as her mentor.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview1-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With so many characters, including my personal favorites Leo, Steve, and Hwoarang all making appearances, it has my blood pumping, and I can’t wait to see how they play. Even in the core box, I could already tell that care was being put into highlighting qualities of the characters to make them feel different from one another, such as King’s ability to throw opponents around or Yoshimitsu’s special wheel that lets you bid life to spin for a potential big payoff. I can’t wait to see how all the other characters feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the different stage hazards, the quick-to-learn systems, and highly detailed miniatures, Tekken: The Board Game has quickly shot up my list as one of my most anticipated board games next year. My biggest worry is that, with just how many characters they're promising, some will run the risk of feeling samey. Time will tell how successfully the team is able to avoid that potential pitfall, but considering that by taking the expansion approach with the characters, not to dissimilar to something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide">Unmatched</a>, means fans can pick and choose from those packs they want, and aren’t required to buy them all. Even the core box offers a good bit of variety on its own. You can have a perfectly good time with that alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tekken’s initial campaign is over, late pledges will be starting soon with an expected delivery date of April 2026, but if you want to try it out for yourself, head over to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-arena-subscription-plans">Board Game Arena</a> right now, or check out the WIP <a href="https://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/Gamehelptekken" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>rules</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/im-getting-bored-of-every-playstation-game-telling-the-same-story</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-getting-bored-of-every-playstation-game-telling-the-same-story.1314934/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a huge fan of PlayStation’s first-party offerings. They’ve come to embody the sort of cinematic adventures I’ve always looked for when sitting down with a controller in my hand, feeling like genuine blockbuster events meant to be savoured. But where in the past this brand of glossy storytelling felt like new ground being trodden, I can’t help but feel that recently it's become the well-worn road. It’s not just that all of PlayStation’s major releases adhere to the now-trademark third-person, cinematic stylings – the stable of developers has become seemingly obsessed with stories that explore the exact same themes: grief and revenge. And  I’m starting to get tired of it. As a rule, these games are all impeccably well made, but I’m starting to miss that era when PlayStation’s range felt wider and things were a little more “fun.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The realisation that so many PlayStation games have explored the same grim story themes struck me when playing through Sucker Punch’s new Ghost of Yotei. While I thoroughly enjoyed it and admire its consistently exciting approach to combat and the genuine sense of discovery it creates through exploration, I couldn’t help but feel I’d been told its story before. As Atsu, you’re tasked with avenging the death of your parents on a blood-soaked journey across 17th-century Japan as you hunt down each of ‘The Yotei Six’. Not only is this tale unfortunately close to the plot of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which I also played to completion earlier this year, but it's the same combination of fiery revenge arc crossed with meditations on what is to grieve that has become something of a hallmark for PlayStation Studios in recent years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2020’s The Last of Us Part 2 is an obvious trailblazer, with Ellie’s dark descent into a rage-filled embodiment of revenge coming as a result of the death of her father figure, Joel. That, of course, was the sequel to the 2013 original that explored how Joel struggled to cope with the death of his own daughter. At the time, The Last of Us was seen as fuelling a wave of “sad dad” games, including 2018’s God of War, but in hindsight, these were the building blocks for PlayStation’s preoccupation with grief. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2022’s God of War Ragnarok is a story fuelled by the loss of mothers and sons and the anger that comes with them. Insomniac’s Spider-Man series follows both Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they attempt to overcome supervillain threats as well as wrestle with their demons stemming from dead parental figures. 2020’s Returnal is a looping sci-fi nightmare born out of the protagonist Selene’s familial grief-related trauma. And then there’s 2025’s other big PlayStation exclusive, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which may not technically be a first-party game, but certainly is a verifiable feast of maternal and paternal anguish.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The “cycle of violence” is in very real danger of becoming a loop of diminishing returns.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: I’m a fan of all of the games listed above, each singular in its depictions of characters and each offering wildly different gameplay experiences. But when viewed as a whole, it's easy to hear that their stories are all being sung from the same hymn sheet. Familial grief is at the centre of all of these stories, and while I certainly feel that mature themes have a place in games, it is all starting to feel like I’m getting hit around the head with the same ideas at this point. The “cycle of violence” is in very real danger of becoming a loop of diminishing returns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s true that not <em>every </em>PS5 game follows this pattern — Astro Bot isn’t an exploration of generational trauma in deep space — but you catch my drift. I think that’s incidentally what I enjoyed so much about Team Asobi’s ode to PlayStation of old, with its joy and colour standing out from the otherwise morose crowd. It felt like a rarity. But it never used to be this way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS3 gave us Naughty Dog’s Uncharted era, which, although it eventually ventured into more melancholic territory in A Thief’s End, firmly planted its flag in themes of adventure with a tone ripped from the pages of pulp fiction. I’ll always have a soft spot for Insomniac’s Resistance and its World War 2/sci-fi warfare mashup, as well as LittleBigPlanet, which, all the way at the other end of the tonal spectrum, celebrated creativity and community. Yes, these games all contained varying levels of character nuances, but were all fundamentally about different things: treasure hunting, alien invasions, and personal expression. They weren’t all trying to serve the same story, and I can’t help but feel that if a new Jak and Daxter game were to come out today, it would be about an Ottsel’s thirst for revenge against the killers of his blonde-haired friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hope that future PlayStation exclusives can look to this more varied, interesting past for inspiration, even when choosing to tackle more “serious” subject matters. Team Ico’s PS2 classic Shadow of the Colossus took on a mournful tone, but found something truly unique and poignant within it, at a time when such ideas were far less common in games. It stands as a unique masterpiece to this day, telling its tale through vagaries and minimal cutscenes – a far cry from the trademark cinematic style we now expect of PlayStation games. What we didn’t have back in the mid-2000s were five more PS2 releases that took its exact contemplations on love and loss and told the same story in a different wrapping. Every time you played something new from Sony’s studios on the now 25-year-old console, it felt like a brand new experiment with a different story to tell, not just a variation on a theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings me back to Ghost of Yotei, a game that is superior to its predecessor in almost every aspect, barring its central story. While I connect to Atsu more than I ever did Jin Sakai — she’s a much warmer presence to spend a few dozen hours with — Ghost of Tsushima’s narrative explores different, fresher ground. The story balances the personal struggles of Jin against the backdrop of an invasion of a nation, with themes of honour, betrayal, and belonging striking a chord and making it stand out when it arrived hot on the heels of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020, before grief seemingly took hold of every Sony storyteller.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps PlayStation’s interest in grief is a reflection of the state of the world, though. When viewed through the lens of when PS5 exclusives like Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2 were being written, that melancholy is somewhat understandable. The COVID pandemic inarguably took hold of our planet in the years 2020 and 2021, and as such, themes surrounding unexpected loss and mass trauma would no doubt have been at the forefront of many minds. It will therefore be intriguing to see if this pattern will continue much further, then, now that the world has (somewhat) settled back into what it looked like beforehand. Will the stories being told in projects that began production post-2022 mirror a different state of the planet, or continue to look inside ourselves at our darkest moments? These are, of course, all valid tales to tell, and I’m a huge proponent of art being reflections of those creating it, but I can’t help but wish for a little more variety going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s reason to be hopeful and skeptical, considering what Sony has coming up next. Insomniac’s Wolverine looks to be delivering on all of the gore and decapitation you’d hope to see, but will that mature rating be reflected in its themes? Logan is certainly a character consumed by a lust for revenge; will that see us taken down a familiar path of burying past demons through ultraviolence, or will we get an altogether different story that taps into a different part of his psyche? James Mangold’s Logan already told us a tale that would’ve slotted nicely into PlayStation’s “sad dad” canon, as X23 tapped into the softer side of his adamantium body, so I do hope we don’t just get a rerun of that idea here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also know that Saros is on the way from Housemarque in March, and it certainly looked impressive in the most recent State of Play stream. As for Naughty Dog, the ground zero of this long-running era of grief, we know that the studio will be taking on the sci-fi realm next with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Its first trailer was promising, delivering a more fun-filled tone than we’d ever dream of seeing from The Last of Us. Of course, we’ve barely scratched the surface here, but it would be fantastic to see Naughty Dog rediscovering some of that Uncharted levity here. Both of these upcoming PS5 games, incidentally, are stories about people investigating lost off-world colonies. I hope for my sake that they find wildly different stories to tell on each of them, rather than discover reminders of the grief they’ve left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <p>Sega has revealed its limited-edition trainer collaboration with Puma, to celebrate the release of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>Puma already showed off the trainers back in August, but Sega has now unveiled the full capsule collection.</p>
<p>While Sonic gets a custom pair of Puma Inhale trainers, Shadow and Tails have their own version of the Puma Inverse. These come in blue, black, and yellow - according to the characters' colours - and have various swappable features. I'm quite partial to the gold ring in the laces, myself.</p>

<p>In addition, Puma is releasing some apparel too, which "blends motorsport styling with graphic cues inspired by racing and design elements from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds".</p>
<p>The collection includes a hoodie, a jacket, t-shirts, and even a bum bag (or fanny pack, for those of you in the US).</p>
<p>The collaboration also goes the other way, with Puma-designed in-game decals with which to customise vehicles in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds. These will be added to the game for free.</p>
<p>The trainer and clothing collection launches on 30th October and will be available from the Puma online store, flagship stores, and selected stockists. The UK prices are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>And frankly, compared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-donkey-kong-wasnt-harmed-in-the-making-of-these-nike-trainers">Nike's furry Donkey Kong trainers</a> or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wants-you-to-literally-put-your-foot-into-animal-crossing-with-upcoming-crocs-collaboration">absolutely vile Animal Crossing Crocs</a>, these Sonic-themed trainers are footwear I will happily slip my feet into.</p>

<p>As per leaks last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-and-shadow-coming-to-fortnite-leaks-suggest-but-not-how-youd-expect">Sonic and Shadow sneakers are also expected to make their way into Fortnite</a> soon.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is out now across all major platforms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Our review</a> praised its "exquisite handling model" despite all the chaos.</p>

            <p>Cocoon - Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year - is leaving Game Pass soon. Thankfully, for those with a PlayStation, it'll be headed to PlayStation Plus later this month.</p>
<p>It's departing Microsoft's gaming subscription service alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donut-county">Donut County</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</a>, and Core Keeper.</p>
<p>As for its newfound peers coming to PlayStation Plus, Cocoon will be hanging joining the service alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> across all tiers. It's be available to download on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>Those feeling smug on the PlayStation side of the aisle should still keep a swivel on, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>, Stardew Valley, and Viewfinder will soon be leaving the monthly game line-up. Users will have until 6th October to grab 'em before they are no longer offered up as part of the monthly package.</p><p>Only yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">Game Pass had its price hiked up to $30 a month for its ultimate tier</a>, in spite of record breaking subscription revenue last year. This'll come with a shaken up rewards program, with users no longer able to directly redeem Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">This follows a price increase for Xbox hardware back in September</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-is-eurogamers-game-of-2023">In our 2023 Game of the Year feature dedicated to Cocoon</a>, Eurogamer staff wrote: "Cocoon. Of course it's our game of the year. Cocoon is ingenious, elegant, and thought-provoking. It's precise, expressive, and generous. It takes game design forward even as it seems to emerge from its deep history. But more than anything, Cocoon is playful. Its puzzles, its tricks, all yield to playfulness."</p>

<p>Out of this world?</p>

<p>Happy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> release day on Switch! Whether you're buying one (or both) of the classic Wii platformers for the Switch — which also have a free patch for Switch 2 — you'll probably want a good idea of how each of them look and run, and what the differences are between their older versions.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q">Digital Foundry</a> has the lowdown on just what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> play and run like on both consoles, and in comparison to the Wii versions (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">All-Stars</a>, in Galaxy 1's case).</p>
<p>And, really, it's a clean upgrade overall, with the big winner being the updated textures. Paired with the resolution boost on both Switch 1 (1080p) and Switch 2 (4K), all textures — from grass to walls to even the shiny stars — the games look beautiful. You can see the stitching in Mario's dungarees now!</p>
<figure data-uuid="93d4566b71770"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93d4566b71770/super-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFCLRCvdzY">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Galaxy 2 is obviously the highlight here, as this wasn't rereleased alongside its predecessor before now, and the jump is significant. Sharper character models and polygons mean the game looks the best it can, and we're delighted.</p>
<p>For both games, there are very few drops on the Switch 1 version, and even fewer on Switch 2, meaning these are the prettiest versions of the game to play. The only real downsides come from the lower bitrate in cutscenes, and there's colour-banding in the sky in a handful of places.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is a lovely — if pricey — treat for fans of Super Mario Galaxy. And for those of you who've never played these games before? You're in for some magic.</p>

			<p>Three years ago, in May 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-brand-starting-in-2023/">learned we were officially coming to the end of an era</a>: EA's annual football games would no longer be titled 'FIFA' followed by the corresponding year. After the FIFA organization <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-name-change-ea-billion-dollar-licensing-fee/">reportedly requested a $1 billion licensing fee</a> from EA, the long-held partnership ended, with EA moving on to call its annualized football series 'EA Sports FC,' creating new licensing deals with the professional football teams and leagues featured in the game. FIFA, for its part, declared it would develop its own football game, and we've just seen what that looks like. A <a href="https://www.playfifaheroes.com/">mascot-forward mobile and console game</a> called FIFA Heroes.</p>



<p>'Mascot-forward' means that instead of the game featuring professional footballers, it features the mascots for international teams, including Maple the Moose for Canada, Zayu the Jaguar for Mexico, and Clutch the Eagle for the United States of America. It's a five-a-side game that doesn't seem to take the same simulation-forward approach as EA Sports FC, but instead is depicted as something closer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Sloclap's Rematch</a> or other arcade-focused football games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A press release for FIFA Heroes describes players being able to<em> </em>build their "<em>dream squad with beloved football personalities, recognizable fictional characters and FIFA’s official mascots through the years</em>." It'll feature both PvE and PvP matches, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority</em>," said Christian Volk, director of gaming and esports at FIFA. "<em>With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who’ve grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem</em>."</p>



<p>The game is being developed in a partnership between FIFA, Solace, and Enver Studios, with Solace's director, Kyle Joyce, adding, "<em>From day one, Solace has worked closely with ENVER, the development studio, to create pioneering game development experiences that bring players together</em>. <em>With FIFA Heroes, we set out to capture what actually makes football so compelling: speed, drama, and rivalry. Football has a unique way of bringing people together, and this game is our way of putting that love of the sport into play.</em>"</p>



<p>With the FIFA World Cup returning in 2026, it's possible that FIFA Heroes could lean on the tournament to create a solid level of popularity. Though any hype or popularity gained will only be maintained if the game is actually good and fun to play. We'll see how FIFA's first major game release separate from EA goes when it arrives sometime next year.</p>
