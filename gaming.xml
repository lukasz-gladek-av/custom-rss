		<p>One of the biggest success stories of the past decade has been the breakout popularity of the Yakuza franchise. The success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a> in the West spurred Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio to redouble their efforts on more timely localised releases, and eventually to also bring the series to PC and Xbox alongside PlayStation. Up until now Nintendo has been left out of the party, but with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, they’re finally getting an invite.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza 0 Director's Cut –&nbsp;Red Light Raid in the Switch 2's exclusive multiplayer mode" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPQeyZg2fhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yakuza 0 is, as you can infer, a prequel. Set 17 years before the events of the original game –&nbsp;remade in Yakuza Kiwami – we get to see the origins of up-and-coming yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and his fledgeling rivalry with cabaret club manager Goro Majima in the tail end of the 1980s.</p>


<p>We got to play a chunk of the early story mode, starting in Chapter 3 just as Majima is on the search for a new headliner for his club, running around town, getting into scraps with both local thugs and an old man that’s insistent on training him in multiple styles of combat. Oh, and checking out the local arcades, of course.</p>
<p>RGG has sprinkled some new incidents and character backstories into the game to justify this Director’s Cut label, though we don’t really know how extensive they’ll be.</p>


<p>Much more important is that the game looks and plays great on Nintendo Switch 2. This is an old game that honestly shouldn’t trouble the Switch 2 hardware, especially when docked, as we were capturing it, and it runs flawlessly from what we can see.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s the headroom here for RGG Studio to get a little bit silly, a bit whacky with their decade-old game, and chuck multiplayer into the mix.</p>
<p>The Red Light Raid mode is just about mad enough that it could actually be a brilliant little time sink. Teams of up to four players get to rampage through cramped close quarters combat against wave after wave of enemies. Each wave you face bounces you to another small arena in the streets, alleys and buildings of Kamarucho, and you’re fighting against the clock to defeat them all and make it to the next stage, building up to a boss fight.</p>

<p>It is rambunctious chaos, bordering on Musou levels of screen-filling action as you often find yourself battling against a dozen enemies or more within tight confines. Button mashing your way through is more than acceptable here, and you’re often pretty likely to at least hit someone most of the time. Some characters are more versatile than others, though. I unlocked and switched to the clown Red Lip Yamamoto and his slow, static sweeping scythe attacks make staying with the fast-pace of battle more of a challenge than sticking with Kiryu.</p>
<p>There’s some good twists here, such as how Kiryu and Majima have both been split out into their three separate fighting styles, meaning that they don’t have any advantages over the dozens of other unlockable characters. We’re in the meaningless money zone for unlocking those characters, with prices starting at ¥10 million, which you can easily earn from just a few successful wave clearances. You get the big bucks if you’re able to fully clear a mission, but the grind will probably start to set in as you upgrade characters to improve their stats.</p>

<p>Still, this could be a fun added diversion for people picking the game up on Nintendo Switch 2, and it’s great to see the Yakuza and Like a Dragon franchise start to make its way to Nintendo’s hybrid console. Yes, the games run great on Steam Deck and other PC handhelds, but those are still a very niche market when compared to the mass appeal of the Switch.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve played this game elsewhere already, there’s probably little incentive to pick this up again on Switch 2, but this is opening up a new audience for the franchise, and that’s always good to see.</p>

Patel wrote in a brief update. Patel's new role at Night School will again be as a game director, though what she's working on remains unannounced. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Night School is most famous for its Oxenfree series of games, the most recent being 2023's Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals. The Netflix-owned studio launched Black Mirror spin-off Thronglets earlier this year, around the same time it suffered an unknown number of layoffs. Months before, Netflix completely shut down another of its studios, working on a AAA game project headed up by Halo veteran Joseph Staten.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patel had been a veteran of Avowed developer Obsidian, and over 11 years worked in various senior positions on games such as Xbox sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds and the classic Pillars of Eternity series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, Patel had taken on the reigns of directing Avowed after the game was rebooted early in its development. Avowed had initially been planned with a darker fantasy setting closer to The Elder Scrolls, with one big open world and multiplayer co-op. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Patel steered the game to launch as a brighter, more unique-looking experience, now featuring multiple large individual maps to explore, and an entirely single-player experience.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avowed - Xbox Developer Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The response to Avowed was mostly positive, and Patel had initially discussed plans for the franchise to continue — either with expansions, a fully-fledged sequel, or both. Now, however, Patel won't be part of that future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-update-14-patch-notes-include-arachnaphobia-mode-and-2025-post-launch-roadmap">Avowed development roadmap announced last week detailed an array of mostly minor additions coming for free over the coming six months</a>, including a Photo Mode and New Game Plus offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With awesome worldbuilding and stellar character writing, Avowed reminds me why I fell in love with Obsidian's RPGs in the first place," reads <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">IGN's Avowed review</a>. "However, the bigger picture is that it plays it quite safe, with a by-the-numbers fantasy adventure that's more familiar than evolutionary."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian's next project to launch is The Outer Worlds 2, which is due to be shown off in detail at this year's Xbox Games Showcase in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

			<p>Microsoft is blaming Apple for the delay of its Xbox mobile store launch. The report comes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from The Verge</a>, which found out that the Windows and Xbox company filed an amicus brief supporting Epic Games' fight against Apple.</p>
<p>While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-appointed-to-accept-no-tax-ruling-on-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent ruling</a> cracked the door wide open for the Epic Games Store and for the Xbox mobile store on iOS, Microsoft is wary of Apple's inevitable appeal and, as such, has filed a detailed argument in favor of the current ruling.&nbsp;Here's an excerpt from the filing:</p>
<p><em>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</em></p>
<p><em>Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices. Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility. Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.</em></p>
<p>The Xbox mobile store was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-to-launch-mobile-store-via-web-in-july-microsoft-sees-tremendous-growth-in-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to launch in July 2024</a>. When we last heard about the topic in late November, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed Google</a> for trying to block it from launching on its Android ecosystem.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-finally-back-on-ios-app-store-after-protracted-epic-apple-spat.1194966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is finally available on the iOS App Store once again, following a protracted legal battle between itself and Apple over third-party payment systems and storefronts.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic confirms that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has been re-added to the App Store on both iPhones and iPads in the US, while in Europe, it's available as part of the mobile version of the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>Just last week, Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">complained that Apple was blocking the release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the App Store, leading to a worldwide outage of the game on the platform until the issue was resolved (which, thankfully, now looks to be the case).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=6sJ6H9Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=XPMkebt9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple has restored&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the iOS App Store in the US and the mobile Epic Games Store in Europe.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic's battle against Apple began back in 2020, when the former hosted a sale on in-game currency that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">slashed up to 20% off prices</a> if customers used Epic's own proprietary payment system rather than Apple's.</p>

<p>Apple swiftly retaliated by removing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. It wasn't just Apple whose wrath Epic incurred, either; the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">also sued Google</a> after the game was removed from the Play Store for the same reason.</p>

<p>What followed was a protracted battle between the two companies, one that saw Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-epic-request-to-relist-fortnite-in-korea" rel="nofollow">blocking numerous attempts</a> on Epic's part to get&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store" rel="nofollow">relisted on the iOS App Store</a> in various territories.</p>

<p>In April this year, Apple was forced to pay a €500m fine by the European Commission due to its refusal to allow developers to direct customers towards alternative third-party payment systems, which Epic will no doubt have seen as a huge win.</p>




<p>As for what's going on within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently in the middle of its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle season</a>, which has introduced character skins like Darth Jar Jar and Emperor Palpatine to the game.</p>

<p>Rather embarrassingly, however, Epic had to issue an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed" rel="nofollow">emergency hotfix last week</a> thanks to an AI-powered Darth Vader that was openly swearing at players. Needless to say, he won't do that anymore. I, for one, am disappointed.</p>

The Last of Us creative director Neil Druckmann says that he'd be keen to revisit the post-apocalyptic series, provided that certain conditions are met.</p><p>One of the primary requirements for Druckmann is that he'd want the threequel to have a story that's "worthy" of being set in The Last of Us series. The creator says that he aims for quality over quantity, an artistic vision that has extended to other projects he has worked on.</p><p>"While I am the caretaker of this franchise, whatever the title is that Sony has entrusted me with, it's important for me that everything is of high quality. I don't want to just make a lot of it. I want to just be very thoughtful about everything that we make," Druckmann said in an interview with Sacred Symbols.</p><p>"When we did the show, now we've teamed up with, I feel like, the best TV-makers, with HBO. We're making the best version of it. If we were ever to come back to it, I want to make sure that it's a story worthy of The Last Of Us. I love that world. I love these characters.

            <p>Microsoft has sided with Epic in its feud against Apple, claiming the iPhone maker has "stymied" the company's efforts to launch its Xbox mobile game store.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft announced plans to release a new Xbox mobile game store</a>. At this time, the company envisioned it to be ready for release by that summer. However, this did not happen.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft has filed a legal brief in support of Epic Games as part of Apple's appeal against a recent ruling, which follows a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple, and has now resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite making its return to the App Store in the US</a>. Here, Microsoft shed more light on the delay to its own mobile store.</p>

<p>Microsoft stated it wishes to "offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store", but efforts have been "stymied" by Apple and its strict App Store rules.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case">The Verge</a>, this is how Microsoft explains its current situation:</p>
<p>"The district court's injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store - accessible via link-out - for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple.</p>
<p>"Prior to the district court's most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple's new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft's communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction."</p>
<p>As noted by the publication, the recent court ruling does make it possible for Microsoft to launch its mobile store, but the company still wants to ensure Apple's appeal against the ruling is unsuccessful, in order to avoid having to potentially remove its own store further down the line.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes in its filing that Apple "makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone", and that the company's own "experience managing app stores confirms that Apple's policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal".</p>
<p>We will keep you abreast of any further developments regarding both Epic vs Apple, and Xbox's mobile store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-game-director-leaves-obsidian-to-join-netflix/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Avowed Game Director Carrie Patel has left Obsidian after over 11 years to join Netflix, specifically the Night School Studio responsible for the Oxenfree franchise. Patel herself provided the announcement <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7330425052565307393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>The news is rather unexpected, to be honest. Following the successful launch of Avowed, Patel <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> her interest in doing more in the same world now that the team had found its groove, so to speak:</p>
<p><em>Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it.</em></p>
<p>There didn't seem to be any issues between Patel and Obsidian. It's possible she simply got a better job offer and decided to take it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Night School Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-lays-off-employees-at-oxenfree-maker-night-school-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered an unknown number of layoffs just three months ago</a>. Following the 2023 debut of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-familiar-yet-distant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</a>, the Californian studio has just released the mobile life simulation game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netflix.NGP.Venice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thronglets</a>, based on the Black Mirror IP. However, given Patel's long-standing expertise in the RPG genre (she also worked on the two Pillars of Eternity games and The Outer Worlds), it seems likely that Night School Studio could be heading toward that kind of game for their next project.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent action roleplaying game</a> has just received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/obsidian-announces-its-2025-roadmap-for-avowed-update-1-4-patch-notes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed roadmap of updates.</a> The Summer patch will add new NPC abilities and behaviors, new active and passive abilities, new Unique armor and weapons, cooking and crafting improvements, and custom map markers. The Fall update will introduce the highly requested Photo Mode and New Game Plus, a new weapon type, the ability for players to change their character's appearance while out in the world, new character presets in the creation tool, and more Godlike feature character presets.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the many game studios smashed to pieces by Embracer Group has come back to life. Campfire Cabal, which was seemingly shut down in 2023 as part of their parent corporation's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">scorched earth "restructuring" policy</a>, have crawled out of the grave to announce they're still around and, in fact, "never stopped working". They've been making a new game in the Expeditions series of historical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, and have been given "the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are finally ready to reveal that Campfire Cabal was never shut down," say the studio in <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/">a post on their website</a>. What happened, they say, is that the THQ-owned studio were ordered to close by Embracer two years ago. But some agreement was reached to keep the company going with a reduced headcount, and they instead cut an unknown number of employees from payroll. </p>
<p>"Though we did have to say goodbye to many of our colleagues, the studio survived and a compact team continued the project we had started in 2022. At the end of March of 2025, we received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production."</p>
<p>That project is a new game in the Expeditions series of RPGs, which includes the classical centurion stomping of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-rome">Expeditions: Rome</a>, the top-down shield-battering of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-viking">Expeditions: Viking</a>, and gunpowdery land-grabbing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/expeditions-conquistador">Expeditions: Conquistador</a>. The studio aren't saying much more about the new game, though. Only that it'll be "set in a new period of our history and in a new part of the world for the series". Expeditions: Mongol, anyone? Expeditions: Pirate? Expeditions: Islamic Golden Age? I guess we'll find out.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Expeditions: Rome had some repetitive quirks but was a "seriously good - and lovingly detailed - romp through centurion times," said Nate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/expeditions-rome-review">our review</a>. And Expeditions: Conquistador was called "very fine" by Adam, who wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-expeditions-conquistador">his review</a> that some parts were a chore, but "the focus on stories and characters means that there is almost always at least one interesting plot on the boil". </p>
<p>You should know, however, that Campfire Cabal aren't the original studio who made the older Expeditions games. That would be Logic Artists, who were subsumed and digested by blockchain bullshit peddlars Dynasty Studios. But the Cabal have since become custodians of the series under rights-holders THQ. As with many creative studios, it's a bit of a Ship of Theseus situation, somewhat complicated by a round of layoffs and this subsequent reappearance. We'll have to wait and see how the next entry carries the torch.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't that interested in the RPGs, the "revival" of a seemingly shuttered studio is interesting in a wider sense. It could be seen as a hopeful sprout of green emerging from a blackened earth laid bare by years of seemingly endless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>. Or it could simply be the re-emergence of a scarred and injured body from a bloody-watered moat, a studio bravely limping on in spite of the brutal overlord that threw them in there, alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eidos-montreal-lay-off-75-workers-in-further-cuts-to-the-deus-ex-studio">bodies</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-frightfully-british-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-and-sequel-plans-are-already-in-discussion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Atomfall - the seudo-apocalyptic survival game set in 1950s rural England - was "immediately profitable" for developer Rebellion, and now talks of a sequel are already afoot.</p>
<p>Atomfall released back in March across PC, PlayStation and Xbox. It was also available on both Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, likely bolstering its popularity. Speaking to Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> last month, Rebellion head Jason Kingsley noted that much of Atomfall's success could be attributed to its release on Game Pass, stating it "does mitigate risk" and guarantees "a certain level of income" for a studio.</p>
<p>But, even though it was indeed available to play via Xbox's subscription service, of course meaning players did not have to buy the game outright if they already had Game Pass, Atomfall still made back its development costs more or less straight off the (cricket) bat.</p>

<p>This nugget comes from Rebellion head Jason Kingsley, who sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eD2qMEcR8">The Game Business</a> to reflect on the launch of Atomfall and the industry in general.</p>
<p>During this chat, the studio affirmed the studio has DLC for Atomfall planned, but also that the idea of a sequel or a spin-off has already been floated, saying Rebellion of course wants to "keep on making games" in the future.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rebellion wants to "continue to make more good games," Kingsley said. "We've now got the challenge of a massive new success in Atomfall. What do we do in the future with Atomfall? Well… we've got DLC coming up," he continued before adding: "We're talking about what do we do about sequels? Do we do spin-offs?"</p>
<p>So, is a sequel something you would like to see for Atomfall?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-release-breaks-records-for-sniper-elite-studio-though-i-thought-wed-have-drunk-more-tea">Atomfall was Rebellion's "most successful launch" ever</a>, and soon after it was released the studio celebrated 1.5 million players joining in the oh so rather British fun. At this time, the studio revealed we had managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea in the game, though those numbers are likely even higher now.</p>
<p>If you haven't played Atomfall for yourself yet, but are curious about it all, you can check out our review. "If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," our Tom wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">awarding the game three Eurogamer stars</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/vales-echo-is-a-dark-gothic-foray-into-the-cosy-horror-genre/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There is something very wrong in Vale’s world. For one thing, everyone is dead, and for another, she’s trapped here. Billed as a cosy horror game – there’s an oxymoron of a genre if ever I heard one – this gruesome landscape is populated by the strangest, most sinister creatures you’ve ever seen, but they’re kind of friendly? When they’re not about to eat you, that is.</p>
<p>Vale’s Echo looks sublime. A 2D puzzle adventure that toys with elements of the gothic, the macabre and Eastern European folklore, Roberta Railité’s hyper-stylised artwork makes it feel as though you’re playing a horror comic strip, each area dripping in unsettling details and populated by fish-men, ghouls and at least one giant crab beast that wants to devour you with its sharp, pointed teeth.</p>



<p>Vale herself seems fairly nonchalant about the whole situation, and she’s an instantly likeable character, with her emo-goth clothing and Gen Z outlook making it seem as though this is quite normal. The fact that’s she’s accompanied by a helpful floating skull who offers words of advice is actually kind of reassuring, and while there is nothing normal happening here, you feel empowered to be curious, to explore, and to do so without too much dread. I guess that’s the ‘cosy’ part.</p>
<p>You make your way through each area, opening cupboards, looking at pictures, and finding insects or occasional bits of severed human remains, while attempting to solve the light environmental puzzles set in your way. These might extend from finding a key, through to deciphering a monster’s taste in food via their penchant for art, but it’s all very focused, at least here in our hands-on. Nothing feels like too much of a leap in logic, and it flows together at a pace that feels natural and unforced.</p>


<p>It’s all held together by the atmospheric soundtrack provided by Shaun Głowa, his dark synth work ebbs and flows through your exploration, adding further menace and dread to each moment. The audio-visual design is simply tremendous, and I think Vale’s Echo will attract a lot of fans, just on aesthetics alone.</p>
<p>The key here is that I want to continue playing. I’m not normally a fan of the horror genre, but I do enjoy dark fantasy settings, which this feels more in keeping with, and the setting and storytelling is perfectly weighted to pull you in. Deividas Baumilas, the game’s lead developer, caught me as I finished up, and noted that I’d told the truth to a fish-man about what I’d done to his family – spoiler, I’m lucky all he did was strand me in a boat.</p>
<p>He told me that for one thing, most of the people playing choose to lie, so I felt fairly smug about taking the moral high ground, but also, that it would have later consequences in the game. It hints at a branching narrative that alters based on your previous choices, and gives each of those decisions extra weight.</p>

<p>Vale’s Echo is a weird, dark, but undeniably enchanting foray into the cosy horror genre. It builds an absorbing world, and, beyond anything else, you’ll want to steer Vale to safety.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-the-biggest-launch-in-ids-history-but-no-sales-figure-yet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> has seen 3 million players since coming out last week, but Bethesda has yet to announce a sales figure for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post</a> from Bethesda confirmed that Doom: The Dark Ages is the biggest launch in id Software’s history by player count, getting to 3 million seven times faster than 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth digging into the details on these numbers. Doom: The Dark Ages released across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on May 15, 2025. Steam is the only platform that makes player numbers public, so let’s start there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Doom: The Dark Ages hit a peak concurrent player count of 31,470, and has a 24-hour peak of 16,328 concurrent players. Doom: Eternal hit a peak concurrent player count of 104,891 five years ago, a figure that makes The Dark Ages look like it struggled relatively on Valve’s platform. 2016’s Doom, for extra context, has a peak concurrent player count of 44,271 on Steam, a figure set nine years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, we must consider the Game Pass effect when thinking about these numbers. Doom: The Dark Ages was a day-one launch across Game Pass for both Xbox consoles and PC. There will be a number of people who dipped into The Dark Ages via Game Pass, rather than pay the $69.99 it costs to buy the game in the U.S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps, from Microsoft’s point of view, that’s absolutely fine. It wants to sell PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions after all. But we’ve seen games sell well while also launching day-one on Game Pass, such as the $50 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Clair Obscur has sold an impressive 2 million copies, despite also launching on Game Pass. Doom: The Dark Ages is more expensive — might its price have put some people off?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which leads me to the next point: Bethesda has announced 3 million players for Doom: The Dark Ages, but not a sales figure. It’s a similar approach it took when celebrating the success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which has seen 4 million players while also launching day-one on Game Pass. Coincidentally, Ubisoft also announced 3 million players for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</a>, rather than hard sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, only Bethesda and Microsoft will know if Doom: The Dark Ages has hit whatever internal targets it has set. But it’s safe to say that the 3 million player count suggests Doom: The Dark Ages has done particularly well on console and Game Pass, while perhaps struggling on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a> returned a 9/10. We said: "Doom: The Dark Ages may strip away the mobility focus of Doom Eternal, but replaces it with a very weighty and powerful style of play that is different from anything the series has done before, and still immensely satisfying in its own way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Gone are the days where a new console generation is expected to bring a game-changing amount of new technical capabilities, according to Akio Sakamoto, chief technical officer at Kojima Productions. The developer said the difference between the PS4 and PS5 "isn't so great" but at least makes development "more efficient."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/death-stranding-2-technical-director-says-that-the-jump-from-ps4-to-ps5-isnt-so-great-its-just-more-efficient/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, which will be released on PS5 in June, Sakamoto compared the experience of developing for the two latest PlayStation generations. Where current-generation consoles used to bring major upgrades--just look at the difference between the original PlayStation and the PS2--the latest generational upgrade doesn't have as much impact on what developers can achieve.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1838715317" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt in The Witcher games, has called out so-called fans as "stupid" for describing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> as "woke" for having Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">revealed the next game and its protagonist last year</a>, though some have already criticised the studio as "woke" for having a female protagonist.</p>
<p>"That's just stupid," said Cockle in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufg-mhMsR7o">video published by Fall Damage</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">IGN</a>). "There's nothing woke about it."</p>

<p>He continued: "[Ciri's] a cool character from The Witcher, and they're going to focus on that character. I think that's awesome. We can't just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseum, through eternity. Besides, we've seen the end of Geralt's journey - Blood and Wine was supposed to wrap up Geralt's journey.</p>
<p>"I celebrate Ciri. I celebrate her being the protagonist. So all you people who think it's woke… [blows raspberry]."</p>
<p>He added fans of the game should also read the books.</p>
<p>"If you read the books then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," said Cockle. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it. If you think it's woke, read the damn books!"</p>
<p>Following the reveal of The Witcher 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">CD Projekt spoke to Eurogamer about the fan reaction to Ciri</a> as the protagonist.</p>
<p>"So I can really understand if some people, you know, might have wished to play another game with Geralt - like I can say myself, I could make games about Geralt until the day I die, and I would probably die happy," said narrative director Philipp Weber.</p>
<p>"But I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well. So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care. And I think - I hope - we can then convince them with the game itself. Because I think actions speak louder than words."</p>
<p>Earlier this year the studio stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>, meaning it could end up being a next generation game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>A year ago Xbox president Sarah Bond revealed that Microsoft was planning to launch a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">new Xbox mobile web store</a> in July 2024. That never happened. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">I’ve been wondering</a> what the hold up has been over the past year, and it seems we might have an answer: Apple.</p><p>Microsoft filed an amicus brief late on Tuesday, in support of Epic Games’ ongoing fight with Apple’s control over the App Store. The brief takes issue with Apple’s attempt to overturn the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">injunction that allows</a> Epic and other developers to freely advertise alternative payment methods in their apps, and not have to pay Apple additional fees for purchases made outside of apps.</p><p>It’s a key ruling that has already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">allowed <em>Fortnite </em>to return to the App Store in the US</a>, complete with the ability for Epic Games to link out to its own payment system inside the game. Microsoft has wanted to offer a similar experience for its Xbox mobile store prior to the ruling, but it says its solution “has been stymied by Apple.” Here’s how Microsoft explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>The district court’s injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store — accessible via link-out — for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple. Prior to the district court’s most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple’s new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft’s communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction.</p></blockquote></div><p>The court ruling makes it possible for Microsoft to now launch its Xbox mobile store, but it’s clear that the software giant also wants to ensure Apple’s appeal against the ruling isn’t successful. If Microsoft did launch its Xbox mobile store and then Apple won a temporary stay, it may have to pull that store pending the appeal process.</p><p>Microsoft even notes in its filing that “Apple makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone,” so it’s urging the ruling to be enforced pending Apple’s appeal. “Microsoft’s own experience managing app stores confirms that Apple’s policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal.”</p><p>The court ruling also impacts Microsoft’s main Xbox mobile app. “Similarly, Microsoft has long sought to enable Xbox app users on iOS to both buy and stream games in the app from the cloud or their other devices,” says Microsoft in its filing. “Apple’s policies have restricted Microsoft’s ability to offer these functionalities together; the injunction allows Microsoft to explore this possibility.”</p><p>Microsoft started rolling out the ability to purchase games and DLC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649958/xbox-purchase-games-mobile-app-launch">inside the Xbox mobile app last month</a>, but it had to remove the remote play option to adhere to Apple’s App Store policies. You can’t currently buy an Xbox game in the Xbox mobile app on iOS and then stream it inside that same app. You have to manually navigate to the Xbox Cloud Gaming mobile website on a browser to get access to cloud gaming.</p><p>Sarah Bond <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267339/microsoft-xbox-android-purchase-games-us-court-ruling">also announced plans</a> to let players purchase and play games within the Xbox app on Android in October, just days after a court ruled that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">Google must crack open</a> Android to third-party app stores. The feature was supposed to arrive in November, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games">but Bond then blamed</a> a “temporary administrative stay” for holding it back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
