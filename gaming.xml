            <p>Capcom has announced its digital showcase - Capcom Next - will take place next week.</p>
<p>The broadcast will last for 25 minutes, and provide us with updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (which is slated to release next month, on 19th July) and Resident Evil 7's move to iPhone/iPad and Mac.</p>
<p>The highlight of this show, however, will surely be the first look at Capcom's Dead Rising remaster, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-slapstick-zombie-mall-adventure-dead-rising-is-being-remastered">announced quite out of the blue last night</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/showcase/next/en-us/">showcase</a> will air at 11pm UK time on 1st July, across Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/capcomusa">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/capcomusa/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@capcom">TikTok</a> platforms. It will not include any updates on Monster Hunter Wilds, the studio has said.</p>
<p>As for that Dead Rising remaster, the studio has billed it as "an updated release with a brand new look", and coming to "newest generation of platforms". Capcom is yet to share a launch date for the upcoming release, but perhaps we will find this out next week.</p>
<p>Eurogamer rather liked Dead Rising when the game made its original debut all the way back in 2006.</p>
<p>"It may not be licensed by George A. Romero," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-deadrising-x360">wrote Tom Bramwell at the time</a>, "but it was certainly inspired by him, and it replicates a lot of the feelings he inspired in the viewer. And as I plunge yet another sickle into someone's neck and jerk their head off with my foot, showering myself in blood, I can't help but think that he'd rather approve of it."</p>
<p>
Hopefully this remaster will evoke a similar sentiment.</p> <div>

<p>We were introduced to an exciting Zelda game during this month’s Nintendo Direct. For the first time in the franchise’s history, players will step into the shoes of Princess Zelda, offering a fresh and unique perspective. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced-for-september-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 26, 2024</a>, and is now available for pre-order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested players can pre-order The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Store</a> or other retailers such as <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom--nintendo-switch/411895.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch/6509219.p?skuId=6509219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. The base game will cost $59.99, with no pre-order bonuses or special editions available. This means you won’t miss out on anything if you decide to pick up the game on release day.&nbsp;But, if you want to play the game on launch day, pre-ordering is the way to go, as the stocks might end up being sold out at certain retailers. Players will also have the option to redeem Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers while pre-ordering from the Nintendo Store.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will follow a similar art style as The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. Zelda has been tasked with helping people who are being kidnapped through strange rifts. Among the kidnapped is a certain swordsman she needs to find, too. Zelda and her companion, fairy Tri, must use the Tri Rod to create Echoes to overcome all obstacles. Echoes are the new gameplay feature that can imitate objects in the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Echoes can be water blocks, old beds or even rocks; players must find all types of echoes and understand how they can be used to get around Hyrule. With the help of these imitations, you will need to solve puzzles and defeat enemies that come your way. As with all the Zelda titles, there will be a lot of creative freedom as players can think up their combinations with all types of varying Echoes to get further in the story.&nbsp;</p>

But we also realized that to guarantee the best possible experience on launch, we need more time to finish the development of <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. That’s why we made the difficult decision to postpone its release to September 20, 2024.”</p><p>The scope of new works includes new additions to the game mechanics, extensive user interface and user experience enhancements, a popular by-demand city feature called “Zoom Stories,” and more.

These ogres were known to cause no end of problems for the humans they came upon, leading them to be feared and hated, regarded as monsters and demons.</p><p>One day, a trio of soon-to-be folk heroes named Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro decided enough was enough, and set foot upon the land from whence the ogres came: Onigashima. Their goal was to confront the ogres on their own turf and take them down once and for all… and so they did.</p><p>After a long struggle, Momotaro and his crew successfully defeated the leader of the ogres: the beautiful yet dreaded Iroha (CV: Yukari Tamura). And with Iroha’s defeat, the ogres themselves fell to ruin, and peace once again reigned for humanity. Momotaro, Kintaro, and Issuntaro were heralded as heroes, and they all lived happily ever after…</p><p>Or did they?!</p><p>Tokyo, present day.</p><p>Iroha, having used an ancient technique for reincarnation upon herself just moments before her demise, has lived many lives in many forms. Finally, after nearly giving up hope, she discovers the last surviving ogres: a trio of sisters bearing the name of their ancient homeland, Onigashima. She (or, now, he, as a male cat) raises them as her/his own, strictly teaching them the ways of the sword so that one day, s/he may lead them into battle against Momotaro and reclaim the ogres’ rightful place in society.</p><p>And fortunately for them, Momotaro is indeed still out there! Specifically, a guy named Momotaro—who happens to be a 37th generation descendant of the original—just so happens to have been toiling day in and day out as a host in the red light district, and has finally reached his breaking point. He has PLANS now, and suffice it to say, they’re not exactly folk-heroic!</p><p>So, hey, this was supposed to just be a petty revenge story, but with Momotaro suddenly turning evil due to systemic depression, maybe the ogres can actually be the good guys this time around! Lucky… them, I guess?</p><p>What even IS this story, anyway?!</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Ran</strong> (voiced by Yoko Hikasa) – The middle sister. Always has a sword at the ready. Innately controls fire, so many of her techniques are fire-related. More of a doer than a thinker, Ran is the type who will hit first and ask questions later. Comes across as stoic but reliable.</li><li><strong>Hana</strong> (voiced by Ayumi Takeishi) – The eldest sister. Armed with a whip and a longbow. Don’t let her gentle voice and calm-seeming personality fool you: she’s 100 percent sadist. If you cross a line with her, she’ll mess you right up. Generally serious and confident, she’s nonetheless the voice of reason among the three.</li><li><strong>Yume</strong> (voiced by Hina Kino) – The youngest sister. <a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a>ly flaunts her metal club, but also has bombs at the ready. Does not think things through, ever. She acts purely on instinct at all times. Educated through games and anime rather than textbooks, with expected results. Lures you in with her cuteness, but then absolutely demolishes you with words and weapons alike as you approach. Most definitely hazardous to your health.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-Playable Characters</strong><ul><li><strong>Iroha</strong> (voiced by Shigeru Chiba) – Legal (?) guardian of the three Onigashima sisters, and general chief of their operations. Possesses the reincarnated soul of the ogre leader who died hundreds of years prior. Struggles every day to raise his charges as true ogres, teaching them everything s/he knows. Yet, in the end, is still just a cat.</li><li><strong>Momotaro</strong> (voiced by Yoji Ueda) – Momotaro the 37th (Momotaro XXXVII?). Presently works as the #1 host in Kabukicho. Though probably not for much longer, all things considered! Basically, he’s the last boss. He’s had enough of the host life, and now wants to try his hand at being a supervillain. Turns out, he’s well suited to the role!</li><li><strong>And Many More, such as…</strong><ul><li><strong>Tsuru no Ongaeshi</strong> – The Vengeful Crane.</li><li><strong>Urashima Taro</strong></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> – Select from the three Onigashima sisters and challenge main missions and side missions as the tale progresses, leveling up and earning items and money (to spend on items via online shopping, of course!) that help teach you new skills and toughen your stats for the inevitable face-off against Momotaro! Between each mission, listen to witty and often fourth wall-breaking banter among the girls, their cat guardian Iroha, and a wide variety of villains. This story doesn’t take itself very seriously, and neither should you! Just kick back and enjoy the ride!</li><li><strong>Cooperative <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [341 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a></strong> – Up to three players at once can join the fray in this chaotic frenzy of a mode, wherein a number of enemies not seen anywhere else can be encountered, and a vast fortune can be earned through contiguous beatdowns and massively one-sided fights (I mean, it’s three of you against one boss enemy! OF COURSE you’re going to kick yokai tail!).</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new Elusive Target has entered Hitman's world of assassination, as players will have a month to take on the MMA Legend Conor McGregor. The former UFC champion will be playing The Disruptor, a notorious fighter who has risen to the top of the ranks and has a past shrouded in mystery. Pay no attention to the giant "McGregor" tattoo on his abdomen.</p><p>The Elusive Target can be found on Hitman 2's Isle of Sgàil, a secret refuge for the world's billionaires, and tasks Agent 47 with eliminating McGregor so that amateur MMA fighter--and Quantum Leap CEO--Tim Quinn doesn't suffer a brutal beatdown when he steps into the ring.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmlfSLcdDAU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HmlfSLcdDAU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This mission will be free to play for everyone through a free starter pack in The Ostentatious--an Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor Elusive Target. You'll be tasked with completing multiple missions that escalate in difficulty, and if you fail, progress will restart from the first level and the contract will be locked for 12 hours. There'll also be new premium DLC featuring cosmetics inspired by McGregor.</p><p>Elusive Target missions are one of the more-challenging modes in Hitman. The people marked for death don't show up as a red silhouette when you search for them using Agent 47's instinct vision, so you have to find them, observe their patterns, and wait to perfectly execute your plan to take them down. This isn't the first time that players have had a chance to take down a celebrity, as shortly after the release of Hitman 2, a character modeled on and voiced by actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-still-kill-sean-bean-in-hitman-2/1100-6463369/" data-ref-id="1100-6463369">Sean Bean</a> was inserted into the game. We've also seen Gary Busey.</p><p>Hitman fans looking for a new perspective on the game can get a virtual-reality headset ready for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-is-reloading-for-another-run-at-vr-assassinations/1100-6523855/" data-ref-id="1100-6523855">Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded</a>. Developed by XR Games in collaboration with IO Interactive, the game will allow you to dual-wield guns and random objects when it launches exclusively on Meta Quest 3.

		<p>In life, the simple things are best. A peaceful walk through an autumnal forest, eating a melted marshmallow fresh and squishy from the barbecue, a classic Victoria sponge cake. When it comes to video games, the same life rule applies; and what better example than the old-school arcade racer? Thrills, spills, and no more complexity than going eye-dissolvingly fast in a mostly straight line. Horizon Chase 2 is the epitome of this ideology, it also has amongst the best local multiplayer features I’ve ever encountered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Horizon Chase 2 Launch Trailer | Out Now on PlayStation 4 &amp; 5 and Xbox Series &amp; One" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B_kr1WraP5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Horizon Chase 2 is the sequel to the 2018 original, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/31/horizon-chase-turbo-review/">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>, and it shares a great deal with its forebear – bright and bold 90’s visuals, easy-to-pick-up controls, and crazy fast top speeds. This then, is the most traditional of sequels: mostly more of the same, but bigger and better.</p>


<p>The visuals are an example of this design approach, having seen a noticeable improvement in detail, though thankfully retaining their charming old-school aesthetic. Whilst the array of vehicles is more limited than in the original game, they can each now be upgraded to a far greater extent, as well as being customisable. Swap out the tires, change the chassis, or splash out on some new paint – these options are hardly going to give Forza a run for its money but they are a neat addition.</p>


<p>I must say, the choice of available vehicles all play it rather straight. I found myself missing the comical cars like the Learner-Driver, the Camper-Van, and the Handy-Man Sedan. Perhaps these lighter-hearted mobiles will be released as DLC, but for the moment players are stuck with the sportiest of sports cars and little else.</p>
<p>Track design meanwhile, benefits from weather effects and more varied courses. The track will split into divergent paths before combining a little while later, whilst the cars can be battered by a passing sand storm. New pick-ups add a shade of complexity too; boosts litter the track, and nitro can be gained in segments rather than in one power-up. Also, players rejoice, no more fuel meter! Getting rid of this abomination was a smart move on behalf of the developers, lowering a big hurdle for new and young gamers alike. Now, rather than worrying about collecting fuel, players can just focus on the fun of going very fast.</p>
<p>And what speeds Horizon Chase 2 reaches! This is a super-slick game with an eye-wateringly fast frame rate to match, and the visual velocity is kept up even in four-player split screen.</p>

<p>There is far more online functionality this time out, which is a welcome addition, but it’s in local multiplayer that Horizon Chase 2 belongs. Along with regular races and tournaments, other players can easily drop into any event throughout the extensive world tour mode. They can even help out whilst racing, gathering collectibles that all go towards the primary player’s overall progress. Helping out your kid unlock a brand-new vehicle is one of those special multiplayer moments that Horizon Chase 2 has in droves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-options-to-change-console-graphics-settings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Capcom has released another update for Dragon's Dogma 2 across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>While the majority of adjustments have been made across all devices, the team has also added some console specific updates with this patch. It has now added the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off.</p>
<p>Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>As for that 120hz option, Capcom stated while this setting "does not guarantee 120fps", it "may make the game display more smoothly" should your monitor support it.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the above, this update takes aim at a number of the usual bugs and fixes across the board. For example, players will no longer be able to enter areas they weren't meant to be able to, and the prices for precious stones in Vermund should now be correct.</p>
<p>It has also added the function to sell items from the storage menu and the option to turn the Arisen's visibility on or off in photo mode.</p> <div>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>
<p>The game is "a huge improvement over the original, and a captivating journey from beginning to end," reads Eurogamer's five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>

        <p>Developer aims to use these tools to produce dynamic interaction between objects</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Roblox is working towards providing players the ability to create characters and objects with "4D generative AI".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai">recent post to its blog</a>, the developer explained that 4D generative AI will focus on interactivity when creating people, objects, and environments.</p>
<p>These 4D generative AI tools aim to make 3D objects more dynamic by using generative AI text or voice prompts to create a drivable race car, for example.</p>
<p>"With 4D generative AI, Roblox has opened up a new frontier for experience and asset creation," the developer explained. "While the challenges are new, our process for innovation is well honed.</p>
<p>"We will combine our internal research and development teams, university collaborations, and rapid iteration of prototypes in partnership with our community."</p>
<p>Last year, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>spoke to Roblox CTO Daniel Sturman <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/robloxs-top-tech-officer-talks-ai">about its conversational AI tool Roblox Assistant,</a> and how the company intended to use generative AI across various aspects of its platform.</p>

            <p>
The release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has reawakened the typical Soulsborne debate around high difficulty, but even the game's creator struggled to play it.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a>, FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki discussed playing Elden Ring in the run up to Shadow of the Erdtree but struggled as he's not a very good player.
</p>
<p>
"Leading up to the release of any game, I'll be very hands-on playing it and getting as much time on it as much as possible," he said. "But after the release, I tend to not want to touch it, because I know I'm going to either find things that I left on the table or issues that will bug me. And once I become a player, I'm powerless to do anything significant to change it. So once a game is out in the wild, I tend to not play."

<p>
He continued: "But in preparation for Shadow of the Erdtree, I played through the main story of Elden Ring. I want to preface this by saying I absolutely suck at video games, so my approach or play style was to use everything I have at my disposal, all the assistance, every scrap of aid that the game offers, and also all the knowledge that I have as the architect of the game ... the freedom and open-world nature of Elden Ring perhaps lowered the barrier to entry, and I might be the one who's benefiting the most from that, as a player, more than anyone else."
</p>
<p>
As an open world game, Elden Ring is more approachable than previous FromSoftware games, and provides players with plenty of options to help: be that co-operative play, extra summons, or simply wandering off to grind for runes. And if Miyazaki is relying on these features to finish the game, so can you.
</p>
<p>
It is somewhat amusing, however, that Miyazaki conjures these dark, terrifying worlds for players to battle in, but struggles to play them himself. No wonder he admitted to being a "huge masochist" in a <a href="http://soulslore.wikidot.com/das1-game-no-shokutaku#toc0">previous interview</a>.

</p>
<p>
"There are some areas that are designed to be funny and with humour in mind, but I think a lot of the time things we try to take seriously or try to approach from a serious or dark place tend to get construed as humour," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-on-originating-the-soulslike-genre">later told Eurogamer</a>. "But it's not a calculated thing, we don't set out to make a lot of these games and characters funny. I think it is just interpreted this way and is construed in that way due to the player and the environment they're playing in. A lot of it is not intentional."

Legendary player <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-legend-let-me-solo-her-is-back-but-with-a-new-name">Let Me Solo Her has now returned for Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to help players struggling with bosses, so look out for a summon sign if you're struggling.

</p>
<p>
FromSoftware also released an update for the game this week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">adjusts the balance scaling of Shadow Blessings</a>, which should make the DLC a little easier.

            <p>Development on slip-slidey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-3-rivals">Tribes 3: Rivals</a> is set to slow, just months after its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tribes-3-rivals-is-out-in-early-access-now-for-another-shot-at-making-tribes-popular">early access launch</a>, as developers Prophecy Games say it’s not proving successful enough to "support the studio."</p>
<p>In a post ominously titled "<a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update">Tribes 3 Player Update</a>", Prophecy first announced that anyone who’d paid up microtransaction money in Rivals – as well as their previous game, extraction shooter Starsiege: Deadzone – would receive an equal amount of credit to spend in their upcoming "sports shooter" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950580/Ultra_Strikers/">Ultra Strikers</a>. Then, the bitter chaser: both Deadzone and Tribes 3 will go on the backburner, while Ultra Strikers becomes the studio’s main effort.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development", the post reads. "We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p>
<p>"Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!"</p>
<p>It's true that Tribes 3 didn’t launch into the same cult hit status as previous Tribeseses – according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/#max">SteamDB</a>, its daily playercount dropped into the low hundreds within days of its early access release back in March. But it’s hard to see a way forward now that its remaining players can only expect small, sporadic updates at best.</p>

<p>I don’t mind admitting: this one stings, friends. Tribes 3 might have launched without much meat on the bones, with the combined-arms bombast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tribes-ascend">Tribes: Ascend</a> looking a long way off, but I could see and feel it improving with several of its earlier patches. Especially the updates to the series’ signature skiing movement, which did eventually deliver the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/notes-from-the-tribes-3-rivals-playtest-its-fun-but-is-it-tribes">sense of breakneck pace I was hoping for</a>. Unfortunately, the game’s chances of riding that momentum into a new era of movement shooteriness seem slimmer than ever.</p>
<p>For many, that may not be a surprising outcome: certain sections of the Tribes fandom are famously suspicious of attempts to make a new version of the thing they like. In hindsight, maybe I too should have hardened my heart, given Ascend’s grim fate. But then isn’t there another way of looking at this? I waited a decade for more Tribes, and even if it wasn’t finished, and even if it was for only for a matter of weeks, <em>I had it</em>. Sometimes, letting yourself be hurt again isn’t an entirely bad thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new update on the upcoming Street Fighter movie has revealed that it will be released in 2026, despite the project losing its directors.</p>



<p>In an update to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date-despite-reportedly-losing-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Sony Pictures confirmed that the movie will be released on March 20, 2026, but the company did not reveal who will now direct it. </p>



<p>So far, all we know about the project is that it’s being produced alongside Street Fighter publisher and developer Capcom, with directors Danny and Michael Philippou walking away from the project due to scheduling. </p>



<p>There has yet to be any official announcements on who will be cast in the film.</p>



<p>Street Fighter has already had two films, which were perceived pretty poorly by audiences. The 1994 film was given a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1058516-street_fighter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20% audience score</a> on the&nbsp;review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes but did accumulate $100 million at the box office though on an estimated $35 million budget. 2009’s Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li didn’t fair much better either with audience ratings, coming in at <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/street_fighter_the_legend_of_chun_li" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">18%</a>.</p>



<p>It’s unclear when we will get more updates on the upcoming movie, but with less than two years until its intended release date, information could trickle through soon.</p>

        <p>Xbox is the most popular controller among players, according to Valve</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>More players are choosing to use a controller while playing games on Steam, according to Valve.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811">update issued by Valve</a>, it found that since 2018 daily average controller use has increased from 5% to 15%, with 42% of these sessions involving Steam Input, which allows players to use different types of controllers.</p>
<p>There are over 300 supported controllers that players can use on Steam. Valve found that the Xbox controller is the most popular choice, with players opting to use that in 59% of sessions compared to 26% for PlayStation controllers and 10% on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Steam recently added support for a new wireless Hori controller, which is officially licensed by Valve and is fully compatible with the platform on desktop and Steam Deck. It's set to launch on October 31 in Japan, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-official-steam-controller-is-on-the-way-yes-for-real/1100-6524544/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">GameSpot</a>.</p>

		<p>Capcom has announced a mini summer showcase, with Capcom Next: Summer 2024 set to take place on 1st July at 11PM UK time (3PM PDT). The stream will run for 25 minutes and focus on three upcoming game releases.</p>
<p>Capcom has already confirmed what they will be showing off, so don’t <em>expect</em> many huge announcements, but you can still keep your fingers crossed for some surprises.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4">watch the stream when it goes live on YouTube here</a>.</p>


<p>They will explore the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-by-capcom/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, which was announced yesterday and promises “a brand new look” for the newest generation of consoles.</p>

<p>There will also be updates on Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which launches on July 19. The game looks to be an interesting fusion of strategy and action as players escort a Spirit Stone Maiden through the world, trying to cleanse villages and then enlist rescued people to fight back against the Seethe. Here’s the most recent gameplay trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuVS2SpFQz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rounding things out, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> for iPhone, iPad and Mac will also be shown during the stream. Capcom has ported Resident Evil Village and Resident Evil 4 to Apple’s platforms in the last few years – Village first arrived for Mac in 2022 before it and RE4 were ported across in late 2023 after the launch of the iPhone 15 Pro. It’s only this latest Pro model phone that is powerful enough to handle AAA games of this scale, while the minimum for Mac and iPad is to have an M1 chip, which first debuted in 2020.</p>

            <p>You will be able to arrogantly ignore the advice of your wife and councillors in whole new ways in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>, thanks to a small but mighty update to the game's message settings. Players are due to be given much more granular control over what scrolls and missives appear on their troubled monarch's war table, thanks to the free update that will accompany the Roads To Power DLC. Paradox talk about this and other upcoming changes (including a new start date) in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/?emclan=103582791465554434&amp;emgid=4188991669958508422">update post on Steam</a>. Some rulers among you will be excited by all the Byzantine bureaucracy that will headline the DLC. But real kings care about filtering information in extremely picky detail. Still don't know why this is big Crusader Kings news? Come with me, you insolent wretch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Customisable message settings is an oft-requested feature by CKIII players. If you have ever juggled organizing a feast in the castle with a war in Andalusia and a spymaster who keeps trying to poison your favourite accountant, you will know how important it is to keep a clean feed of information flowing into your hands. You'll soon be able to do that with much more control, judging by <a href="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//36033026/d98ce6080638ff63907d49d1dc72050c98d740fa.png">this screenshot</a> of the upcoming quality-of-life feature. </p>

</figure>
<p>God, that's an exciting menu. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-ii">Crusader Kings 2</a> and other Parastrats like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> have long enjoyed a similar feature that lets you decide, in itty-bitty detail, which message types you think are important, and which you don't give two figs about. But Crusader Kings 3 still doesn't have those options. So you're forced to trust the game's own info-sorting, meaning you sometimes miss significant events, or get endlessly informed about dozens of things for which you simply don't care.</p>
<p>This is due to make persnickety players like myself, who want to tailor their own story, very glad. Message settings have probably been on the drawing board at Paradox for a while, given the howling cries from the masses yearning for the feature. "I hate it when I suddenly notice bits and pieces of land around me suddenly belonging to a different ruler," says one such <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/imbk3n/can_we_please_please_have_message_settings_back/">kingly wail</a>. "I found out I had grandchildren years after they had died without even realizing they were born in the first place," says another noble soul. Yes, Crusader Kings continues to have the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJvXWoHUAAAC49x.png:large">best out-of-context storytelling in PC games</a>, even when the players are complaining.</p>
<p>The free update that adds this feature isn't coming until September, alongside the release of the paid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Roads To Power DLC</a>. But it's the smallest-but-powerfulest addition to the game that I have heard about for a while. Thematically, it is like choosing which of your messengers deserves to be let into the throne room, and which to dismiss with a firm breaking of the legs (to steal Nic's summary of the feature from our chat in this morning's meeting, please don't tell him).</p>
<p>The Steam post that covers this goes over plenty of other features, not to be sniffed at. Some will accuse me of burying the lede for only addressing now the addition of a new start date, for example. Players can currently start the game on the year 867 or 1066, but will soon be able to begin on the year 1178 too. That date was chosen partly because of the various scoundrels and saints alive at that time (hi, Genghis), with Paradox saying they "want to give you as many options for worthy historical figures as possible". But it's also a good time period to coincide with the new mechanics of the Road To Power expansion, they say. </p>
<p>There are yet more details, including chat about the new "Administrative government" features. But I'm not going into that. Go read it yourself to learn about changes to vassal directives (tasks your underlings must carry out, often very reluctantly), and to sip upon plenty of chat about the Byzantine Empire, a confusing realm for which I do not care. Give me Vikings or give me death (or Spain... or North Africa... or Ireland... or...)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186771/hitman-conor-mcgregor-elusive-target-ufc-disruptor-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OadpWD">Agent 47’s next assassination target is Conor McGregor, the MMA fighter and star of this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24049549/road-house-jake-gyllenhaal-trailer-release-date-amazon-prime"><em>Roadhouse</em> remake</a>, developer IO Interactive announced Thursday. McGregor will serve as the next <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/18/16673752/hitman-elusive-targets-return">elusive target</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23537193/hitman-3-renamed-free-games-2-3-steam"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em></a><em>,</em> and he’s available in all versions of the game from June 27 through July 29.</p>
<p id="XVYMbb">McGregor’s <em>Hitman</em> character is known as The Disruptor, and he’ll be portrayed in game as — what else? — an MMA fighter. The Disruptor is set to compete against Tim Quinn, the CEO of Quantum Leap, who previously appeared in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22237877/hitman-3-review-io-interactive"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> mission “The Farewell.” According to IO Interactive, stakeholders at Quantum Leap fear that Quinn will be humiliated by The Disruptor, and have tasked Agent 47 with taking down McGregor’s character before the match can happen.</p>
<p id="tpWQik">The Disruptor mission sends players to the island of Sgàil “during a conclave of the secretive Ark Society, an organization composed of the world’s most rich and powerful people,” IO Interactive said in a news release. The mission will be available to play for free for <em>Hitman</em> newcomers as part of the game’s Free Starter Pack. </p>

<p id="5Thxll"><em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> players can also access the mission for free, and can purchase a $4.99 Disruptor DLC pack, which offers a new fur-coat cosmetic, as well as kettlebell, resistance band, and cane items, which you can presumably use to kill Conor McGregor. That DLC pack also offers permanent access to The Ostentatious, a two-level Arcade contract featuring The Disruptor elusive target. </p>
<p id="hFWQQ2">The ability to eliminate McGregor virtually should be cathartic for the UFC fighter’s detractors, whether they’re wroth over his general attitude, his clownish performance in the unnecessary <em>Roadhouse</em> remake, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-67152914">sexual assault allegations levied against him</a>, or his <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conor-mcgregor-ufc-champion-timeline-arrests-abuse-1234772835/">history of out-of-the-ring violence</a>. </p>
<p id="IxHNci">If killing Conor McGregor sounds like your cup of tea, the Disruptor elusive target mission is available starting today on the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X versions of <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p id="isaxAj">The Hitman series has included celebrities as elusive targets before, notably with actors <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12213078/hitman-gary-busey-outer-helmet-protector-protector">Gary Busey</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/28/18113485/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-mark-faba-undying">Sean Bean</a> serving as limited-time assassination victims in <em>Hitman</em> and <em>Hitman 2</em>, respectively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/someone-is-already-beating-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-at-level-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Those Scadutree Fragments aren't hurting, though.</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> has been out for less than a week, and we already have absolute sickos beating the new content's bosses at level 1. Just because they can!</p><p>A content creator known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lastdarkhope9988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LastDarkHope</a> has been quietly plugging away on their YouTube channel for the last few months, defeating Elden Ring boss after Elden Ring boss with absolutely no rune levels gained, and no equipment leveled up. That's impressive enough on its own, but when the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC dropped last week, this incredible player simply started beating those bosses too. Again, this is without using runes to level up at all, and without using any smithing stones to upgrade equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Critically, LastDarkHope does seem to be using Scadutree Fragments. These fragments only impact the DLC content, but they do give damage negation and damage output increases that are far from negligible. As we've mentioned elsewhere on site, the Elden Ring community has been <em>really </em>struggling with the difficulty of some of Shadow of the Erdtree's bosses. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty">Scadutree Fragments are the DLC's way of countering its heinous difficulty</a>, and you're very much encouraged to seek them out if you're having trouble. But it seems that even these buffs weren't enough for many, pushing FromSoftware to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-first-patch-in-update-1122">drop a patch today</a> that increases the benefits from earlier Scadutree Fragments before leveling out their buffs later on.</p><p>That said, what LastDarkHope is doing is still a wildly impressive feat. Most people who are struggling with these bosses and stocking up on Scadutree Fragments are doing so at levels well beyond 100, while LastDarkHope is still stuck at 1. No 60 Vigor, no wildly high Intellect or Strength, and no ability to wield certain weapons with specific stat criteria. What's more, they don't even seem to be going that hard on Scadutree Fragments despite collecting a few. Checking out their most recent stream, it looks like LastDarkHope was barreling around Castle Ensis with just three Scadutree levels. That's certainly lower than I'd personally be comfortable with, and I'm running around with a level 168 mage trying to sneak attack dudes with Comet Azur.</p><p>At the time this piece was written, LastDarkHope had just published a video defeating Chief Bloodfiend and seems to have tackled at least some of Jagged Peak - though no video of the very curse-able Bayle just yet. What's extra interesting is that LastDarkHope doesn't seem to have finished all of the regular Elden Ring bosses yet - ultra-hard Malenia, for instance, isn't listed, nor are the final bosses of the base game. We'll be keeping an eye on their run to see how it progresses...as well as on the certain parade of ridiculously hard runs that other content creators start to drum up in the coming weeks and months. We reached out to LastDarkHope for comment for this story but haven't yet heard back.</p><p>If this somehow isn't impressive enough for you, as we were on the cusp of submitting this story, another wild kill emerged from a different content creator and threw us for a loop. GinoMachino posted their own video of a Level 1, no weapon enhancement, no Scadutree Fragment, <em>no hit</em> kill on legacy dungeon boss Rellana. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GinoMachino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GinoMachino has been on a roll</a> performing all sorts of challenging Elden Ring feats, but this is one of their first cracks at the new DLC, with more almost certainly to come. Absolutely incredible. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This boss is just beautiful. Already one of my favourite Fromsoft bosses.</p><p>Here is an RL1, +0 weapon, Blessing level 0, No status, No Hit kill on her 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/Tc2v9WDJcE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Tc2v9WDJcE</a></p></div>— GinoMachino (@GinoMachino) <a href="https://twitter.com/GinoMachino/status/1806100130589815044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We love talking to people beating Elden Ring bosses in cool ways. In the past we've <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed community hero LetMeSoloHer,</a> as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-streamer-missmikkaa-simultaneously-defeated-two-malenias-with-a-dance-pad-and-a-controller">MissMikkaa, who inexplicably beat Malenia using a dance pad</a>. But if you just want to finish the DLC for yourself before reading about what others are doing, we highly recommend loading up on Scadutree Fragments even if you're level 500. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_Scadutree_Fragment_Locations">Here's a guide to get you started</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The patch brings with it the Sakurajima update; Sakurajima is the new island where players can take control of a tower protected by a new faction called The Moonflowers. The island is home to many new Pals.</p><p>There’s multiplayer-exclusive content, too, in the form of an area in the Desiccated Desert. An oil rig controlled by the Rayne Syndicate is now in the ocean (here you work together with friends to defeat powerful enemies and claim resources such as crude oil). You can extract crude oil by unlocking and placing a new building, the cruise oil extractor, in certain spots around the world. The new material, Plasteel, can be made from crude oil. This is used to craft new high-tier equipment and spheres.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, the level cap is raised to 55, with new technologies available and a new upper limit for Pal’s capture bonus (10 to 12). The new raid, Blazamut Ryu, features the strongest Dragon Pal in the game.</p><p>There’s a tease for a meteorite event: “Meteorites or supplies will fall from space sometimes!” Palworld developer Pocketpair said in the patch notes, below. “There may even be an unknown Pal from outer space too...!?”</p><p>There’s loads more to the Sakurajima update, including new items, new weapons, a new merchant, Tower Boss hard mode, new cosmetics including for Pals, new buildings, a new lockpicking feature, and many improvements and tweaks. The building system is reworked and improved so basic construction should now be “much more intuitive and smooth,” Pocketpair said.</p><p>Of note: the Xbox version of Palworld now has dedicated servers, one of the big points of difference between the game on Microsoft’s console and Steam. However, there is currently no crossplay, which means Xbox and PC players cannot play together. Hopefully this is a feature added further down the line.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Palworld launched in early access form in January 2024 on PC via Steam and on Xbox as a day-one Game Pass title. It saw enormous popularity overnight, becoming one of the biggest game launches of all time. But it’s also one of the most controversial. Developer Pocketpair has said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-says-they-have-received-death-threats-amid-pokmon-rip-off-claims"><u>its staff has received death threats amid the Pokémon "rip-off" claims</u></a>, which it has denied.</p><p>Soon after Palworld’s launch Nintendo moved quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modder-who-put-pokmon-into-palword-says-nintendo-has-come-for-me"><u>to remove an eye-catching Pokémon mod</u></a>, then <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-makes-an-official-statement-on-palworld-we-intend-to-investigate"><u>The Pokemon Company issued a statement</u></a>, saying: "We intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to Pokémon." At the time, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-palworld-blows-up-could-nintendo-successfully-sue-the-controversial-pokemon-with-guns-game"><u>IGN asked lawyers whether Nintendo could successfully sue</u></a>. Pocketpair recently insisted it has yet to hear anything from either Nintendo or The Pokemon Company. It has also teased Palworld on PlayStation.</p><h2>Palworld update 0.3.1 patch notes:</h2><div><p>▼New Content<br>・New Island - Sakurajima<br>⤷ A new island has appeared!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Five is a complicated age for board games. Five-year-olds are just about old enough to play a game by themselves so long as it’s simple, and they’re often fascinated by the idea of structured play that a board game represents. At the same time, they can still find losing difficult to deal with and have very short attention spans. </p><p>To make matters worse, a lot of games you’ll find on shelves have worthy educational themes to entice parents, but kids will spot them as tiresome teaching tricks a mile off and demand something more fun. Finding the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">best board games for kids</a> is no easy task. So here’s a selection of competitive and cooperative games that are easy enough for 5-year-old children to play by themselves where the learning elements are well hidden. And often you’ll find them fun enough to join in yourself, too.</p><h2>TL;DR: The Best Board Games for 5 Year Olds</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#catapult">Catapult Feud</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#dragomino">Dragomino</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#fuzzies">The Fuzzies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#stomp">Stomp the Plank</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#outfoxed">Outfoxed!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#carcassonne">My First Carcassonne</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#monza">Monza</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#concept">Concept Kids: Animals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#magic">Magic Maze Kids</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#animal">Animal Upon Animal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds#hoot">Hoot Owl Hoot</a></li></ul><h2 id="catapult">Catapult Feud</h2><div id="197605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Catapult Feud</h3></p></div><p>The best games for younger children thrive on a mixture of simple rules and compelling premise, and what fits both better than chucking rubber balls to knock down walls of plastic bricks? Each player constructs a castle in whatever shape they like and places a number of troop models about it. Then it’s down to hot, catapult-pinging action as they take turns trying to knock out each other’s troops to win. That’s easily enough to be entertaining for most 5 yearolds by itself, especially with the fun toy aspect of the castles and catapults. But for older or smarter children, there’s also a simple action card system for some basic strategy. </p><h2 id="dragomino">Dragomino</h2><div id="155418" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dragonimo</h3></p></div><p>A great way for kids to get into hobby games is to take a concept they’re familiar with – in this case, dominoes – and give it a fresh new twist. Here, the dominoes show different kinds of terrain. Players choose from four such face-up pieces and fit them into a growing landscape, trying to match the terrain on one or both ends with existing pieces. For each such match they get an egg, which is either worth a point or gives them the right to pick from the piece selection next turn. Fast playing with a cute them and very simple to teach and learn, it’s appealing for children while teaching them turn-taking and simple strategy.</p><h2 id="fuzzies">The Fuzzies</h2><div id="197606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Fuzzies</h3></p></div><p>Most kids love nothing more than knocking over stacks of things, so the classic <em>Jenga</em> has obvious appeal. However, Jenga has various problems for younger children, in particular the time and care needed to stack the bricks, and a problem for adults - the noise! All of these are solved with an added dash of silliness by this game, in which the “tower” is a stack of fuzzy balls, easily set up by squishing them together in the supplied storage tube. A card draw tells players which colour fuzzy they need to pull and stick atop the tower. But make any fall, and you’ll flip the card for a daft penalty, like holding a hand over one eye, for your next pull, and it’s game over if you collapse the tower.</p><h2 id="stomp">Stomp the Plank</h2><div id="197607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Stomp the Plank</h3></p></div><p>Children may be briefly disappointed by the lack of actual stomping in this otherwise delightful game featuring miniature pirate elephants, but that will soon evaporate among the sheer glee it generates. Your goal is to draw a full set of non-identical cards, and you can keep drawing as long as you like. The catch? As soon as you draw a duplicate, your elephant moves one space along its magnetic plank that’s balancing perilously on the box edge. If you stop early, though, you’ll get to add discs to the end of everyone else’s plank, multiplying their peril exponentially. A hilarious push your luck affair, this has been known to win a few adult fans, too. </p><h2 id="outfoxed">Outfoxed!</h2><div id="161850" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Outfoxed</h3></p></div><p>At 5, cooperative games where no one has to suffer the ignominy of defeat are still a great way of avoiding family arguments. And they don’t come much better than Outfoxed, a game of memory and deduction where players have to find out which of an array of foxy suspects stole the chicken pie. It’s got a neat gizmo which determines whether a given clue, such as a cane or top hat, is something that identifies with the suspect’s picture or not. So by building up visual clues about the culprit your group can slowly eliminate suspects and hone in on the criminal. But each clue risks edging them closer to the edge of the board where they escape, pushing the excitement levels higher at every turn.</p><h2 id="carcassonne">My First Carcassonne / Carcassonne Junior</h2><div id="161851" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>My First Carcassonne</h3></p></div><p>The original Carcassonne is a fairly simple strategy game that’s good for older children and families, but it’s still a bit too much at 5. Instead, you can introduce kids to the same concept with this fun junior version. Like the grown-up iteration, it involves placing randomly-drawn tiles to make a network of roads crisscrossing a pastoral scene. But it flips player piece placement on its head, as when a road is complete, players put down matching color pieces from their stock. The first player to put down all their pieces wins. Visually attractive and simple to play, it’s a great way to learn basic strategy concepts.</p><h2 id="monza">Monza</h2><div id="161852" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Monza</h3></p></div><p>HABA are a German company that makes great children’s games with bright, chunky wooden pieces and simple strategies to engage little imaginations. Monza is no exception, using basic concepts to create a fast, fun racing game. The track is divided into coloured spaces and on their turn, each player rolls six colour-spot dice. They then try to plot a course around other drivers and no-go spaces matching the colours they’ve rolled to board spaces. It’s intuitive to play and a great mix of luck, excitement and a little skill.</p><h2 id="concept">Concept Kids: Animals</h2><div id="161853" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Concept Kids: Animals</h3></p></div><p>Concept is a clue-giving game for adults but it also comes in this cooperative kid-friendly version based on animals. The board is full of icons that depict things like color, size, habitat and body shape. One player has a random animal card they can’t see but other players can, and those players have to use the board icons to help the guesser get their animal. It’s a nice level of difficulty for children, plus it has an educational element and is playable without text at a time when kids are still learning to read, making it a great all-around activity for the family or for kids to play on their own.  </p><h2 id="magic">Magic Maze Kids</h2><div id="161854" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Magic Maze Kids</h3></p></div><p>Yet another game based on a franchise for grown-ups (see the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">best board games for adults</a>, btw), Magic Maze Kids ditches several aspects of the original that aren’t kid-friendly, such as silence and the thievery theme, in favour of animals collecting potion ingredients. It keeps the escalating tension of cooperating to try and move pieces around a board as a sand timer trickles down toward a group loss. All the players can move all the board pieces, but each player can only move them in certain directions: the goal is to get particular pieces to particular spots while navigating obstacles. With tutorials to teach them the game and lots of bright chunky pieces, Magic Maze Kids will provide them with an amazing time. </p><h2 id="animal">Animal Upon Animal</h2><p>Another HABA game, this one leverages a popular kid-friendly mechanic, that they’re often better at than adults: dexterity. Faced with an array of cute but irregular animal pieces, the goal is to get rid of all your pieces by balancing them atop one another in the middle of the table. A dice roll dictates your options for the turn, and instead of stacking may see you extending the stack base or even giving an animal to another player, lending some extra excitement besides the risk of a toppling pile. Best of all, unlike many games on this list, Animal Upon Animal is just as much fun for grown ups.</p><h2 id="hoot">Hoot Owl Hoot</h2><div id="161855" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hoot Owl Hoot</h3></p></div><p>As you might imagine from a publisher called Peaceable Kingdom, Hoot Owl Hoot is a cooperative game where the group win or lose together. Your aim is to get all the baby owls back to their nest before sunup by moving them along a track of coloured spaces. You can vary the difficulty level by changing the number of owls, which is a nice touch. Each player has a hand of cards which can move an owl to the next space of the matching colour, leapfrogging owls along the way by calling “hoot hoot.” But if you’re unlucky enough to draw a sun card, you have to play it and advance the timer toward the game end for some added excitement.</p><h2>How to pick games for 5-year-olds</h2><p>Even the most attentive parents can sometimes overestimate what kids this age are capable of, especially if you’re someone that’s into board games yourself. But in reality, while even small children love to play board games, most of them have only the most basic reading and maths, their attention spans are limited, and the idea of taking even the smallest step further toward planning a turn ahead is beyond them. Instead, games for this age group are best focussed on teaching them how to play a structured game: the etiquette of turn-taking, dealing with the upset of loss, and the fact that many games are designed so they can be “exploited” in some way to make winning easier. That means that, for the most part, you’ll be playing the games with them rather than leaving a group of children to play by themselves. </p><p>Two things lend themselves very well to both these criteria: cooperative games and dexterity games. In the former category, you can guide your children gently toward the expected behaviours and lay pointers for them to try and work out the winning tricks by themselves. If they manage to figure it out, they’ll be delighted, and it’s a real moment of wonder. Plus, a joint loss against the game itself is far easier to take than losing against a parent or a peer. The latter, meanwhile, is a genre where kids can generally compete with adults on a much more level playing field, as there’s often little or no strategy and small, nimble fingers can be a real match for a grown-up’s clumsy paws. </p><p>Another thing to be aware of is that a lot of games aimed at this age group are marketed as “educational”, and kids have an extraordinary built in alarm that seems to go off whenever a self-improvement activity is offered to them in the guise of fun. They’re much less likely to engage with it as a result, and these kinds of edutainment titles tend to have a short shelf-life. Remember, when it comes to young kids, almost everything they’re involved in is educational in some way, even if it’s not obviously school related. Games of any kind help teach them good social etiquette, basic maths and the foundations of logical planning.</p><p>For older kids, take a look at the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-teens">best board games for teens</a>.

            <p>The team at Supergiant Games has released its third patch for Hades 2.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">previous patches</a>, the developer has taken its community feedback into account when fixing up its early access release. Changes included within this patch cover everything from Keepsakes, Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and new UI icons to music and visual effects.</p>
<p>There are also numerous bug fixes within this patch. For example, the Hades 2 team has fixed Gold Purse (Charon) not displaying as having Expired when players would expect it to, and the Rod of Fishing indicator should no longer remain visible after you miss your mark.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths.912858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-new-game-recording-beta-lets-you-instant-replay-all-those-elden-ring-deaths<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>From ShadowPlay to OBS, there’s no shortage of tools and apps that can record and share your finest gaming moments and/or hilarious failures. No matter to Valve, who’ve updated the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam">Steam</a> beta client with a replay system of their own.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As explained in this handy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Steam Game Recording guide</a>, you can either start and cease recording clips at your command, or keep it continuously capturing up to 120 minutes of video for later snipping. I’ve given the Game Recording beta a quick whirl in a few games, and while its capture quality is decent, the real reason to use it over rival tools is the video timeline that now lives in the standard Steam overlay. This grants instant access to clips even as they’re in they’re being recorded, so you can skip back and rewatch a moment immediately. As implicitly suggested by Valve’s guide, I employed this feature to replay my perishing at the hands of some knife-spamming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> bullshit merchant, quickly studying his moves in preparation for a more successful rematch. Neat!</p>
<p>Sharing is a big focus as well, with built-in buttons for sending clips to friends or across devices – ideal if you own both a main PC and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, which, by the by, the Game Recording beta also works on. Alternatively you can just export an MP4 to plonk on your own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a>, which is a refreshingly straightforward process compared to how most other game recorders like to either railroad you into online sharing, or hide your local copies in the deepest, darkest file directories possible.</p>
<p>I still feel that Valve’s effort isn’t <em>quite</em> what I personally want from a lightweight capturing tool: I find my most clippable moments in games happen unexpectedly, with little warning to hit a 'Start recording' shortcut, and while the always-on recording option would suit better, I’m equally un-keen on traipsing through two hours of footage to find a nine-second clip of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> baddie copping a particularly funny <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-darktides-gruesome-co-op-my-greatest-ally-is-a-rock">rock throw</a>. <a href="https://medal.tv/">Medal</a>, which retroactivelycaptures the last few seconds of play on each shortcut press, is the best fit I’ve found so far, but its interface is a UX nightmare and there’s no simple 'Save as MP4' option for trimmed-down clips. Bah.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I appreciate how Steam’s recording feature is nestled so neatly into the overlay we’ve all been using for years, and that instant-replay functionality could be pretty helpful in those "Wait wuh I missed that" moments. If you fancy trying it out, just opt into Steam’s beta client via the Settings &gt; Interface menu.</p>
