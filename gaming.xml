        <p>Would be nice if they could just be honest for once</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">since reported</a> that between 300 and 400 positions have been "eliminated" across EA, including around 100 at EA. One of the cancelled incubation projects was also apparently an extraction shooter set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe.</em></p>
<p>
Apex Legends developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> have announced that two of its incubation projects have been cancelled, leading to what it calls a number of "target team adjustments across <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi</a>." You may notice that this language is particularly obtuse, in that it doesn't refer to these adjustments as layoffs. However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">IGN</a>, layoffs have occurred, though just how many is currently unknown.
</p>

<p>
IGN says that it believes around 100 individuals are affected by the decision, which includes developers, publishing, and QA workers across the aforementioned Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation projects. It's worth noting that one of these projects was actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">reportedly cancelled in March</a>, and IGN understands that "some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects."

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA</a> also reportedly didn't comment on how many have been impacted, but did say that they are offering those affected 30 days to find another role within the company. They're also apparently trying to help find roles for as many people as they can internally.
</p>
<p>
The report also says that Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is now taking over the role of general manager at the studio, reporting directly to Vince Zampella. Alongside being founder of the studio, Zampella was previously general manager, while also serving as the head of the Battlefield series. Zampella is continuing as group GM and EVP for both Battlefield and Respawn.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that Jeff Grubb, known for his insider information (he recently accurately reported on the Oblivion remaster dropping last week), has apparently been told that there are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">wider layoffs taking place at EA</a>. Grubb says he doesn't know an exact number, but it's apparently similar in size to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">layoffs that took place last year</a>, which saw around 670 employees affected at the time.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, the whole announcement from Respawn is predictably tone deaf. It claims that Apex Legends will be "exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play", while ignoring the fact that cutting a team to such a degree whilst it's in the midst of making "Apex 2.0" won't help them meet those margins the game is currently failing to achieve. Fingers crossed that everyone affected is able to land on their feet.

One of these canceled incubation projects is the same one <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">already reported on back in March</a>. The other, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reports</a>, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe, code-named R7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected — their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today," the post continued. "We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that roughly 100 individuals are affected by the changes, including a mix of developers, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals on the Jedi team and on the incubation projects. IGN also understands that at least some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects. When asked, EA declined to comment on the exact number of individuals impacted, saying it is offering impacted individuals 30 days to find a new opportunity inside the organization and is endeavoring to find roles for as many individuals as it can internally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Internally at Respawn, work will continue on Apex Legends as well as the game's next iteration, the next entry in the Star Wars: Jedi franchise, and support on the upcoming Bit Reactor Star Wars game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-officially-revealed-with-2026-release-window">Star Wars: Zero Company</a>. EA declined to say whether or not any other incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is being elevated to general manager of Respawn, and will report directly to Vince Zampella. Previously, Zampella served as GM of Respawn, the studio he founded, in addition to his role as head of the Battlefield franchise. Zampella will continue as group GM and EVP overseeing both Battlefield and Respawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-isnt-doing-the-business-for-ea-so-its-making-apex-legends-20-to-come-out-after-battlefield">just last February</a>, EA told investors that Apex Legends was "not headed in the direction that we have wanted" and hadn't been for some time. CEO Andrew Wilson said that Respawn is currently working on a major update, dubbed "Apex 2.0".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our expectation is that Apex will also be one of those franchises and that sometime on a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," Wilson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes continue a trend at EA of canceled projects, layoffs, and restructuring that's been going on for several years now. It began in 2023 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">elimination of 50 jobs at BioWare</a> and an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-developer-codemasters-suffers-round-of-layoffs">unknown number more at Codemasters</a>, and continued when EA <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">laid off 670 workers</a> company-wide, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-hit-by-layoffs-amid-eas-ongoing-reductions">around two dozen workers at Respawn,</a> and canceled several projects. More recently, EA restructured BioWare, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">moving developers to other projects</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect">laying off others</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s for up to three players (you can play solo with two bots, like in the PvE Operations mode), and, as you’d expect, you fight increasingly difficult waves of Tyranids and Chaos. Your class and weapon levels are based on your PvE levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Difficulty will increase for each wave defeated, so you’ll have to prepare yourself accordingly to vaporize as many waves as you can,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The companies also offered a first look, below, at the Horde mode map, which takes place in Kadaku.

                <p>In the latest blow to the video game labor community, Electronic Arts has confirmed layoffs at Apex Legends developer Respawn and the cancellation of two "incubation" projects at the studio. About 100 people at Respawn have been affected by the changes, a report said.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> said a Titanfall extraction shooter, which was said to be in early development, was one of the canceled incubation projects.

Bloomberg said between 300 and 400 people in total are losing their jobs at EA, including the 100 at Respawn. EA Sports FC and Apex Legends underperformed, leading to this latest wave of cuts at EA, GameSpot understands.

That shouldn't come as a surprise, though, as Titanfall 3 was never a sure thing. It appears this could have been the Titanfall extraction game, but it's not clear.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1917273189001974166" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">That Steve Fukuda project is in the bin.

In addition to the rumored Titanfall extraction shooter, the other canceled incubation project at Respawn was reportedly a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-and-titanfall-studio-appears-to-cancel-unannounced-fps/1100-6529955/" data-ref-id="1100-6529955">multiplayer FPS that we first heard about earlier this year.</a></p><p>Respawn itself confirmed the changes in a memo posted online. In the statement, Respawn said it is a studio that embraces "bold ideas" and "creative risks," but they don't always pan out.</p><p>"Our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged," Respawn said.</p><p>EA said it is offering "meaningful support" to affected staffers.</p><p>People affected by the layoffs at Respawn include staffers working in publishing, QA, and members of the Star Wars Jedi and incubation teams, IGN reported.</p><p>Respawn will continue to develop more content for Apex Legends and build the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/respawn-to-develop-final-game-in-star-wars-jedi-trilogy-says-ea/1100-6526559/" data-ref-id="1100-6526559">next Star Wars: Jedi game</a>, but EA declined to confirm if any incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p>For a long time already, EA management had signaled problems for Apex Legends.

Respawn added that it wants to "push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition, creativity, and integrity that our community expects."</p><p>As for the Star Wars: Jedi team, Respawn said the next entry in the series aims to "raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay."</p><p>In February 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">EA laid off around 670 people</a>, which was about 5% of its global workforce. The new round of cuts across EA are said to be "similar" to that round of layoffs in 2024, Grubb said, though the exact number is unclear. EA is making these reported changes just ahead of its next investor briefing on May 6.</p><p>The new changes at Respawn come at a time of uncertainty in general in the economic market for most companies due in part to Trump's scattered tariff policies and other factors. Leading global bank JP Morgan says <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/recession-probability" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the risk of a global recession stands at around 60%.</a></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is about to get a little messier - and marginally more fashionable for those in a certain generational bracket - as it prepares to launch a fresh wave of newly announced Kit DLC.
</p>
<p>
These new small-scale DLC packs begin with The Sims 4's Kitchen Clutter Kit, which does exactly what it sounds like, providing various bits of decor players can use to give their cooking spaces a more lived-in feel. You've got fridges adorned with magnets, open cereal boxes, kitchen timers, recipe tablet, and "much more" - useful for when you're looking to create a living space with more personality than a showhome.
</p>
<p>
There's more mess to be found in The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, which looks to provide fixtures and furnishings players can use to build a well-utilised workshop. "With [this kit], Sims can take well-loved, broken-down appliances, including reviving a microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator and stove with the Handiness Skill," EA explains. "Restore the appliance to its former glory, and make it fully functional again."
</p>

<p>
Rounding out The Sims 4's latest batch of DLC drops is the Golden Years Kit, featuring fashionable looks and accessories Elder Sims can use to "express their individuality". EA is a bit vague on the details for this one, but expect the likes of toupees, gardening gloves, and glasses with straps - meaning Elder Sims with a penchant for partying won't lose them mid-swing.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The Sims 4's Restoration Workshop Kit, Kitchen Clutter Kit, and Golden Years Kit all arrive this Thursday, 1st May. They'll likely cost £4.99 apiece, and will be available on all platforms - which is to say PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world of The Sims, footage from EA's new The Sims "game concept" - which may or may not be the much-discussed Project Rene - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-minutes-of-eas-new-the-sims-game-concept-leak-online">recently surfaced online</a>, and fans eager for a proper Sims 4 sequel weren't exactly thrilled to see what looked like a naff mobile game.

			<p><strong>Update 29/02/2025:&nbsp;</strong>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc">Bloomberg</a> clarifies that somewhere between 300-400 developers have been laid off at EA, with approximately 100 of those cuts coming from Respawn.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the incubation project EA canceled was under the codename R7, and was an extraction shooter set within the world of Titanfall.</p>
<p>In a statement on the cuts, EA spokesperson Justin Higgs said, "<em>As part of our continued focus for our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.</em>"</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>EA has canceled yet another project that was in an early incubation stage at Respawn, one month after it canceled a<a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/"> multiplayer project at the same stage</a>, and according to a report from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-lays-off-unknown-number-of-individuals-again"> IGN</a>, EA will also be laying off an unknown number of employees at Respawn across the Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation teams.</p>
<p>In a statement published to <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">X</a>, Respawn announces that it has "<em>made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects</em>," which refers to the project canceled last month, and another cancellation we're hearing about today for the first time. Respawn continues to add that there will be layoffs across the Apex Legends and Star Wars teams, though it doesn't mention the cuts to the incubation team, which come from IGN's sources.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many people have been cut from Respawn, though the cuts are reportedly being made across departments and aren't focused on one part of the studio.</p>
<p>"<em>As we sharpen our focus for the future, we've made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects and make some targeted team adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi. These decisions aren't easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected - their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today. We're offering meaningful support to those impacts, including exploring new opportunities within EA,</em>" the studio's statement reads.</p>
<p>The statement also addressed what these cuts mean for Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi, saying of the former that&nbsp;"<em>while the team will continue to refine gameplay and bring new ideas to upcoming seasons, we're also investing in what's next for the franchise - exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition</em>."</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, Respawn simply added, "<em>We're excited to keep building new stories</em>—<em>with the next chapter of the Star Wars Jedi series aiming to raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>The booming success of Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi series in 2019 has, in many ways, made Respawn the crown jewel studio for EA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-split-up/">entertainment side</a> of the business. But it's worth asking how long it could keep that status if EA consistently shuts down the new ideas the developers at Respawn come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>studio Respawn Entertainment has been hit by further layoffs, and the studio has also opted to cancel two of its "early-stage incubation projects".</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Respawn announces its decisions to "step away" from the aforementioned projects and to "make some targeted team adjustments" to teams working on&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The projects in question aren't named, though.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA", and that the decisions to cancel the projects and lay off the staff members in question "[weren't] easy".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-respawn-layoffs.jpg?itok=gt0PpKXs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-respawn-layoffs.jpg?itok=efjA4CKk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Staff members working on&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series have been laid off.</figcaption></figure><p>Respawn doesn't say which staff departments have been particularly affected by these layoffs, but it does say that the "next chapter" of the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series will "raise the bar again for storytelling and gameplay", so that's not one of the canceled projects.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em></a>, a turn-based tactics game set in the dying days of the Clone Wars, also won't be affected; it's not an early-stage incubation project, after all, but one that's been fully unveiled.</p>

<p>Rumors are swirling that&nbsp;a third&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>game is in development, but those rumors are fairly insubstantial at the moment, so it's impossible to say whether that was one of the games Respawn decided to can.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that this isn't the first time in the last year or so that Respawn has been hit by layoffs. In March last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow">EA would lay off 5% of its workforce</a>, and that a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>FPS in development at Respawn would be canceled, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">layoffs also hitting the studio</a>.</p>

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to name just a few--Evil Dead: The Game was first revealed at the 2020 Game Awards. After being delayed beyond its initial planned launch date of 2021, the game arrived in 2022 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, and it scooped up generally favorable reviews. Post-launch support for the game included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-splatter-royale-update-launch-trailer/2300-6460548/">Splatter Royale</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-adds-army-of-darkness-update-update-with-new-map-exploration-mode-and-more/1100-6505459/">Army of Darkness</a> updates, and on console, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/evil-dead-the-game-game-of-the-year-edition-launch-trailer/2300-6461252/">Game of the Year Edition</a> was released</p><p>"Evil Dead: The Game is faithful, but sometimes to a fault. If there were more game modes or even more varied objectives in its one attractive game mode, it would feel more like a game for horror fans to play for a long time, maybe even moving competitors like Dead By Daylight or Hunt Showdown off their vaunted pedestals," Mark Delaney wrote In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/evil-dead-the-game-review-somewhat-groovy/1900-6417881/">Evil Dead: The Game review</a>.</p><p>Like the monsters constantly tormenting Evil Dead protagonist Ash Campbell, the IP regularly shows up in new forms. One of the more recent examples is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/retrorealms-review-a-new-horror-multiverse-is-born/1900-6418302/">RetroRealms by developer WayForward</a>, as this gaming hub allowed players to grab Campbell's boomstick and take on the Deadites in a 2D platformer inspired by 16-bit classics.</p>

                <p>EA Javelin, the newly revealed name for the kernel-level PC anticheat currently used in 14 EA games including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-629476">Madden NFL 25</a>, has prevented 33 million cheat attempts since its launch in 2022, with recent updates cutting the number of cheaters players encounter in Battlefield 2042 in half, according to EA.</p><p dir="ltr">While EA's push into new anticheat software for its games began in 2022 with the launch of FIFA 23, there's been little news about its impact since then. Now, EA is sharing more details on its efforts and has even given its software a new name: <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/introducing-ea-javelin-anticheat" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Javelin</a>, one it said was chosen to communicate defense, strength, and agility in the face of cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">In a newly published progress <a href="https://www.ea.com/security/news/anticheat-progress-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a>, EA head of game security Elise Murphy said EA Javelin Anticheat has blocked 33 million cheating attempts across 2.2 billion PC gaming sessions since its 2022 launch. She said the software currently sports a 99% accuracy rate when it comes to identifying and banning cheaters, and that on the off chance it bans someone unjustly, EA has overturned those bans.</p><p dir="ltr">"We take player disputes very seriously as we never want to impact a legitimate player's ability to play one of our games," Murphy said.</p><p dir="ltr">New features introduced to EA Javelin last fall in Battlefield 2042 look to have had a big impact as well. Murphy said the game's "match infection rate"--how often a regular player would encounter a cheater--was cut in half following the new updates to EA Javelin.</p><p dir="ltr">Murphy used the report to try and ease some concerns players may have over EA Javelin's kernel-level approach, one that is also used by Riot Games' Vanguard and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">Activision's Ricochet anticheat</a> systems.</p><p dir="ltr">"While having a kernel driver is essential to protecting fair play in our games, we also understand the concerns that a kernel driver can raise," Murphy said. "EA Javelin Anticheat only runs when one of our protected games is running, and it will uninstall itself if you have uninstalled all of your EA games that have EA Javelin Anticheat protection. We have partnered closely with internal teams and 3rd party assessors to validate that EA Javelin Anticheat will only inspect what it needs to for anti-cheat purposes…everything else is off-limits."</p><p dir="ltr">Though EA has been relatively quiet on its anticheat efforts since 2022, Murphy said it will be sharing updates and deep-dives on the subject more often going forward in the name of transparency.</p>

			<p>Sandfall Interactive has a much bigger success on their hands than they could have predicted with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, so naturally, players who have already gorged themselves on the game since its launch are hoping to hear that there's more to come from the studio.</p>
<p>Which there very well could be, as lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen hints to fans in a conversation on Instagram (spotted by <a href="https://n4g.com/articles/playstation-chances-for-clair-obscure-expedition-33-dlc-are-good-says-lead-writer/">N4G</a>) that the chances are "<em>good</em>" that the team at Sandfall will begin working on DLC, or at least "<em>something more</em>" from the world of Clair Obscur.</p>
<p>"<em>Nothing concrete that I can say at the moment, we're honestly still just trying to process everything that's happening. It's been a lot to take in!</em>" Svedberg-Yen began when trying to answer the question of whether DLC for Clair Obscur is incoming.</p>
<p>"<em>We've always said if there is strong desire from the players that we would love to do something more, and based on the responses so far, I'd say chances are good</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>It's not by any means a definitive answer, but it does point in the right direction for fans of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. And as Svedberg-Yen points out, the team is still just taking everything in at the moment. If there will be DLC incoming, it'll be a while before it's ready to be shown. The new RPG has been a hit, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-surpasses-500k-copies-sold-at-launch/">surpassing half a million</a> copies sold during its launch day and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">then exceeding the one million mark</a> over its launch weekend.</p>
<p>Which is an even bigger feat when you consider that it entered the market as a brand-new series, just days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was released. Both titles were available on Xbox Game Pass, and still, Clair Obscur reached the one million milestone of copies sold in such a short amount of time, not just <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/">player engagement</a>.</p>

Sure, this could be seen as a shot across the bow of the Steam Deck and similar PC handhelds, but it also demonstrates the confidence the studio feels about the upcoming launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">In a new Creator's Voice video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fex9IhmnQe0">on YouTube</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of technology Charles Tremblay expressed his enthusiasm for Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2--specifically in handheld mode.

Another interesting tidbit about the game for Nintendo's upcoming hybrid console is utilizing "one of your Joy-Cons to fight with your katana," according to CD Projekt Red game director Adam Badowski. The developer previously mentioned that touchscreen controls and mouse functionality would be supported when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077 was confirmed as a Switch 2 launch title</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-launch-title-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-features-dlss-support/1100-6530997/">the first Switch 2 game announced to offer DLSS support</a>, with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling being utilized in all four modes for the RPG.

I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ndBoc6R8_A&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulate Saturday morning cartoons and <em>Dr. Slump</em></a>. I love it when they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf7bsmT-Jn0&amp;pp=ygUhaSBkb24ndCB3YW50IHRvIGJlIGEgbWFnaWNhbCBnaXJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put a spin on magical girl tropes</a>. My favorite kind of animated project is when a group of artists unite to craft something that combines the polished flair of a professional animation studio with the charming, rough edges of fan works. <a href="https://youtu.be/p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>FLCL Reanimated</em></a> has been added to my pantheon of favorite anime fan projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A little while ago, I wrote a piece for Gizmodo<em> </em>about the oral history of <a href="http://www.bartkira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bartkira</em></a>, specifically how its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-history-behind-that-viral-bartkira-anime-trailer-2000533127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">animated trailer came into being</a>. <em>Bartkira </em>was a collaborative fan project that started on Tumblr in 2013, in which 768 artists each contributed five pages to redraw six volumes of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/animation-cel-auction-akira-batman-bugs-bunny-disney-1851504043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katsuhiro Otomo</a>’s <em>Akira </em>manga in distinctive art styles reminiscent of <em>The Simpsons</em>. It's all trippy to behold, especially with how seamlessly each painstakingly drawn manga panel blends into the next, creating an almost mural that encapsulates how each artist perceives the formative manga series in their unique styles. <a href="https://youtu.be/0SWt6OQ4Nl4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The animated trailer</a>, which had 31 animators working on it for nine months, is chef’s kiss. Now, history appears to be repeating itself once more with yet another group of artists who united their forces on the internet to reanimate one of anime’s most outlandish and special series, <em>FLCL</em>, just in time for its 25th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FLCL Reanimated</em> was first announced back in 2021 when Twitter user Kobe Kendall, aka Sleptboi, sent out a feeler on an <em>FLCL </em>fan account asking if folks thought it’d be cool if <em>FLCL </em>got reanimated. Like <em>Bartkira</em>, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> saw over 300 artists divvy up clips to remake <em>FLCL</em>’s fifth episode, “Brittle Bullet,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/563432/flcl-reanimated-interview-premiere-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. <em>Polygon </em>also notes that they went the extra mile by creating <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DImNjfCpmyS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover albums</a> and a <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/d659cb0d2a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zine that emulated Newtype magazine</a> filled with behind-the-scenes production materials, which just so happens to be my favorite thing about an animated work. A joke that the creators poked fun at in a promotional video, the work began to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/flclreanimated.bsky.social/post/3lnnnvrizhk23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">become a question of whether it would ever come out</a>. And come out, the episode did. Clocking in at just over 28 minutes, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> is sick as hell.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLCL REANIMATED" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p13E4a_Iy9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Admittedly, <em>FLCL </em>is an anime series that, despite watching, I’m still not entirely sure I comprehend on a strictly narrative basis. There’s a space-faring robot; a pink-haired, guitar-wielding, moped-riding lady who is also from space; and a boy with a rather obvious metaphor for puberty—a bulge on his forehead. From this bulge, the robot and various other oddities emerge, brought forth by the coaxing of said pink-haired cosmic lady. That’s all you need to know, plot-wise. All that matters is that the show is a fucking vibe filled with iconic one-liners, sick music, and fluid action choreography that only old school Gainax could’ve gotten away with in the span of six episode– a trick that’s proven to be diminishing returns whenever Adult Swim has attempted to recapture lightning in a bottle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-progressives-premiere-is-a-little-tame-1826196547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">time and time again</a>, with its <a href="https://kotaku.com/flcl-fooly-cooly-grunge-adult-swim-premiere-review-1850809316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent sequel series that no one asked for</a>. Fortunately, <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> does a superb job of showcasing how bonkers <a href="https://aftermath.site/gundam-gquuuuuux-is-the-sum-of-its-parts-in-the-best-way-possible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kazuya Tsurumaki’s directorial debut</a> was when it was first shown in the States on Toonami. Watching the fan-made episode was like gazing through a kaleidoscopic viewfinder, shifting effortlessly between surreal settings. Each flip revealed a new art style that ranged from dogmatically faithful renditions of its manga to quirky, <em>South Park</em>-esque cardboard cutouts, and an eclectic array of vibrant, kinetic visuals that brought a new texture to the already out-there anime series.</p><p>What’s more, like <em>Bartkira</em>, the lower third of the fan project features the social media handles of its artists, allowing viewers to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbk5weEd5Rk5rOEVZaDdRSGlvWTd1ZE1mb2l5Z3xBQ3Jtc0trQkV2dk5NT0FEc0wyMDBZWFNVbkN5SDlGRkRKUHk3dHR1UjlrVUxwNWV5VFNpTWh2b2NvVmRWdnNSQVNrRndLSGV0NE0xWWdfZURac2M0cUxROTV5QklQWmV4bVdFYnQzbktmMWsxVEZwM1NBSE9Maw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1f5EUWcc-zvLzgrIhc0xOZvTGAICyyfBuNg3ejwAM9vs%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;v=p13E4a_Iy9Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explore more of their work</a>. The damn thing even has eyecatches that give off that kind of modern day Adult Swim Toonami commercial break vibe (and spoof commercials to boot). It’s a slight, old-hat anime touch that does wonders for making a series feel just that extra bit special. I’m particularly fond of the D.A.R.E. ad with Mamimi Samejima smoking a bowl.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching <em>FLCL Reanimated</em> absolutely delivered, reigniting the magic that makes <em>FLCL</em> a one-of-a-kind visual masterpiece. It showcased a stunning tapestry of creativity, proving fan artists can transcend the label of "fan art" to craft something extraordinary. Here's hoping it sparks a fresh wave of fan-animated projects.</p><p><em><strong>Correction 4/29/25, 12:28pm</strong>--An earlier version of this article misstated the number of artists involved in the project.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Netmarble has announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be released on May 21st for PC and mobile devices. This Game of Thrones title puts you in the boots of the heir to House Tyre, a small noble House from the North. You are instructed by Jon Snow to travel around Westeros to rally the Great Houses and the lords of the realm to fight against the White Walkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Launch Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpdoaR8N_a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There will be a fully featured character creation tool, so you can get your heir looking just right, and players will be able to select from one of three classes inspired by iconic roles within the original series – Sellsword, Knight or Assassin, with a a focus on player vs player combat as well as combat against threats that stalk the wilds of Westeros. Players will have the chance to roam freely through familiar settings including Castle Black, King’s Landing, and High Garden.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/22/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-shows-just-how-far-mobile-gaming-has-come/">Game of Thrones Kingsroad shows just how far mobile gaming has come</a></h2>
<p>Dom spent some time earlier this year playing Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, and in his preview he said, <em>“The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos. Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes.”</em></p>

<p>As mentioned in Dom’s preview, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be a free to play title, though people can buy founder’s packs to play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/"> the early access version of the game</a> on PC via Steam. If you are a mobile player, you can pre-register your interest by following the links; <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad on the App&nbsp;Store</a> &amp; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got&amp;pli=1">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad – Apps on Google Play</a>.</p>

If a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell-remake">Splinter Cell</a> remake fell in the woods, would over the top industry secrecy and NDAs even allow us to hear it? That's the million dollar question literally no one is asking, because who phrases things that way, but enough about that game that may or may not exist at this point in time, we've got a different <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> to talk about: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-blacklist">Blacklist</a>. Yes, the, technically speaking, most recent entry in the series just received a little update on Steam yesterday which… <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/235600/view/519711795144819220">adds achievements into the game</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As a reminder, Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a 12 year old game that did in fact release on other platforms, where it also had achievements, so why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have decided to add them in now all this time later is anyone's guess. Seriously, I'm sure this is something that at least one person wants, it's just such an odd thing to do.
</p>
<p>
There is a slight caveat to the announcement that mostly depends on how much you like achievement hunting. Ubisoft explains that "achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game." That means if you've already played the game on PC you'll have up to 28 achievements already achieved, for lack of a better word. Oh, and don't worry, all 19 online achievements that you needed online services for haven't been added in, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-give-online-services-for-older-games-a-stay-of-execution">those services aren't actually offered any more</a>.
</p>
<p>
I do appreciate that a game this old has received a little update like this, but you can't help but wonder what's going on with that remake. The last real update for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splinter-cell-remake-team-share-concept-art-before-going-dark-for-a-little-while">back in 2022</a>, where some concept art was shown off. Since then… not much else has materialised. It's no secret that Ubisoft have been struggling for a while, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Tencent having to give them a whole lot of money recently</a> to keep things running. Maybe with some cash coming in, the time for the remake is almost upon us.
