                <p>Earth Defense Force 6 launched this week for PC, PS4, and PS5, and the Steam version has faced criticism for requiring an Epic Games Store login for online play. But a change to this controversial requirement is already being explored by the game's developer."</p><p>The announcement seemingly came out of nowhere, as the Epic requirement wasn't communicated to players until launch day when the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed it</a> in a Steam post. Of course, players weren't thrilled about this, and the review status of the game was "mostly negative" upon launch, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cult-classic-shooter-series-returns-to-steam-after-5-years-and-immediately-takes-a-piledriver-into-the-review-dumpster-over-epic-games-account-requirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesradar reports</a>.</p><p>Developer Sandlot <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526917398046?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the backlash</a> with a new post on Steam, saying, "The EDF 6 development team for Steam is reviewing and planning changes to the specification that requires sign-in to Epic Games account, which has received the most feedback."</p><p>The studio didn't provide a timeline or what it would change, but the team is now working on a solution. As of right now, Earth Defense Force 6's review status is sitting at a slightly better "mixed" on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Epic requirement for a game on Steam is unusual, but not unprecedented. Another game, Bigfoot, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/509980/discussions/0/3812910932501573788/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously required an Epic account</a> on Steam before later removing it. </p><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is the latest entry in the series that lets players kill giant alien bugs and creatures bent on destroying the planet. The game has been compared to Helldivers and Starship Troopers: Extermination. Coincidentally, Helldivers 2 faced similar criticisms earlier this year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">Sony implementing mandatory PSN account</a> logins after launch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">walked back the requirement following a backlash</a>.</p>

            <p>Paradox Interactive appear from the outside to be a company run by dice roll. That was the case earlier this year when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">cancelled Sims competitor Life By You and closed its developers</a>, weeks after it had missed a project release date.
</p>
<p>"It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change," writes CEO Fredrik Wester in an interim financial report, released today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We end the second quarter of the year with mixed feelings. On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations," writes Wester in <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024">the mid-year report</a>.
</p>
<p>Due to writing down the development cost of 208 million kronor (around £14.9 million) for Life By You, operating profit in Q2 2024 fell 90% year-on-year. Paradox Interactive still turned a profit due to strong performance from what they consider their "core games", including new expansions released for the likes of Stellaris, Victoria 3 and Europa Universalis IV.
</p>
<p>Wester writes that the publisher has "made major changes to how we invest in riskier projects, which means that we have not started new projects with the same combination of high risk and high costs as Life by You" since 2021. 
</p>
<p>Life By You isn't the only troubled project to fall under Paradox in recent years. Cities: Skylines 2 was a long-awaited sequel to a beloved game, but launched with bugs, performance issues and design choices which alienated many of its players. Lamplighters League was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$22 million flop</a> that led to layoffs and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">a parting of ways with long-time development partner Harebrained Schemes</a>. Bloodlines 2 has been in development hell for years, only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-looks-pretty-dishonored-in-this-14-minutes-gameplay-trailer">recently resurfacing under the leadership of The Chinese Room</a>. Prison Architect 2 - somehow not mentioned at all in this financial report - was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">delayed from May until September</a>, leading to long-time development studio partner Double Eleven to leave the project and a new studio to come onboard to finish the game. 
</p>
<p>Wester aims to paint a silver lining around the rough quarter, by noting that "in-house developed core games continue to deliver good content that players have appreciated," but yeesh. You'd think dice rolls wouldn't come up snake eyes so many times in a row.</p>

It was not my intent.” Despite this, she asserts that she “never groomed anyone,” and suggests that her previous humor and the allegations are being lumped together “to create a narrative that [her] behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes.”</p><p>The allegations largely stem from things which took place on a Discord server in which Tyson appeared to have direct communication with a number of fans of both her and MrBeast. Tyson appears to have made a number of inappropriate comments and “edgy jokes” in this server, and during this time she seems to have had a more direct relationship with one minor in particular, named LavaGS, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Rolling Stone</em> investigation</a></span>.<br></p><p>According to the article, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LavaGS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LavaGS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LavaGS</a></span>, who is now 20 years old, has a history with Tyson going back several years. When Tyson was in her early 20s and LavaGS was a teenager, they would regularly communicate via Discord and Twitter, often playing games and exchanging messages containing crude and sexual humor. Eventually, LavaGS was even able to get a job working for MrBeast’s gaming-centric channel, MrBeastGaming, through Tyson. As a production assistant for the channel, LavaGS moderated aspects of the channel, appeared in some videos, and even flew out to MrBeast’s “compound” in North Carolina.<br></p><p>Since the allegations against Tyson were made in June by a right-wing creator, and subsequently picked up by numerous other YouTuber content creators a month later, LavaGS has spoken up a number of times. At first, he came to Tyson’s defense, saying, “These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of.”<br></p><p>Since those initial claims, though, LavaGS has publicly commended Donaldson’s actions against Tyson, and clarified that while he doesn’t believe he was groomed, “there is still alot of other allegations that deserve to [be] investigated thoroughly.”<br></p><p>Since the allegations went wide, a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pokimanelol&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pokimanelol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming personalities</a></span> have spoken up and, perhaps unsurprisingly, some people online have seized on the controversy as an opportunity to deploy transphobic rhetoric against Tyson. A large number of responses to both MrBeast and Tyson’s statements are composed of posts deadnaming Tyson and claims that her identity as a trans woman plays some role in her inappropriate relationship with a minor.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to MrBeast for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, Trap, is scheduled to hit the big screen on August 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dc-forever-superhero-deckbuilding-game-available-now-fore-pre-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for a new DC superhero board game. The game is called <em>DC Forever</em>, a brand new deckbuilding game by Wizkids; not to be confused with the <em>DC Deckbuilding Game: Forever Evil</em> by Cryptozoic Entertainment. This deckbuilder stands out thanks to a unique asymmetrical twist.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/products/dc-forever">store page</a>, <em>DC Forever</em> is a competitive fast-paced deckbuilding game. One player takes command of different DC comic superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.) while the other plays as the rogues (Lex Luthor, The Joker, Cheetah, etc.).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=3Ebq7oJ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JwwZhVMK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>DC Forever</em> different from other deckbuilders like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ascension-legends-brings-back-beloved-deckbuilding-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Ascension</em></a> are its asymmetrical elements. When the game starts, both players choose a handful of characters. Each character in the game has a deck of cards which you can buy from when building your deck. These characters also provide powerful cards to your deck from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is different from most deckbuilding games where both players select cards from a single completely random shop. The game has eighteen different characters, which can lead to many potential strategies and synergies. Adding to the variety are twelve different location cards, which move the action from Gotham to Metropolis to Atlantis.</p>
<p>Lastly, winning a game of <em>DC Forever</em> does not depend on resources. There are multiple ways to win the game, either fighting your enemies directly or spending time working on your master plan in the margins. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Each copy of <em>DC Forever</em> will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>80+ Hero Cards</li>
<li>80+ Rogue Cards</li>
<li>12 Location Cards</li>
<li>8 Unaligned Character Cards</li>
<li>25+ Citizen Tokens</li>
<li>35+ Damage Tokens</li>

It’s a grand fantasy story and an excellent tactical RPG that feels unmatched, even within the franchise to which it belongs. Beyond good gameplay and a fascinating world, what makes<em> Three Houses</em> a modern masterpiece is its cast of characters, each of whom is so phenomenally fleshed out that every single one is likely to be somebody’s favorite. But in recognition of the game’s fifth anniversary, it’s time I declared that one character stands above all the rest: Edelgard von Hresvelg, <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses’</em> greatest triumph.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>As former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Gita Jackson put it in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">their review</a></span> five years ago, “<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> is a game for interesting times.” Those interesting times call for interesting people to inhabit them, all of whom are shaped by the realities in which they live—specifically the impending war over their heads. The “three houses” of the title refer to groups within the game’s central setting of the Garreg Mach Monastery’s Officer’s Academy, one of which you choose to lead at the start of the game. There are the Blue Lions and the Golden Deer, but I am most concerned with the Black Eagles and its seemingly cold-hearted leader, Edelgard.</p><p>Each house leader is the presumptive heir to a given political body within the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. They play as schoolmates and tentative friends, but all exist under the looming shadow that they will likely be enemies when (not if) that impending war does finally begin. Edelgard is the only one of the three who seems to have put any thought into this reality in the game’s first section, which is set during their time at school while a mysterious antagonist known as the Flame Emperor terrorizes the monastery. This can make her an off-putting figure, someone who comes off as calculating and uncaring. As the only female leader, one who, if taken at face-value, could be seen simply as a shallow, bossy woman, it is perhaps unsurprising that the white-haired ruler to be rubbed some people the wrong way. Cut to the game’s big reveal that Edelgard is, in fact, the Flame Emperor, here to overthrow the way of life you and the rest of the game’s cast have been training to preserve. She’s a dangerous, despotic revolutionary that you spend the game’s second section working to defeat. At least, that’s how it goes in all but one timeline.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-recommend-id="image://dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;Me?

Doing so begins the Crimson Flower route. Given the cold and shallow demeanor Edelgard presents at the game’s start, it isn’t necessarily something people will stumble on themselves. Even for those who do choose her house, it requires continued persistence to reach the point where she trusts you enough to reveal her secrets. In other routes, the only identity she earns is that of a horrible antagonist that must be stopped at all cost. In Crimson Flower and the Black Eagles route through the game’s first section, she gets to be human.<br></p><p>Referring to the reveal of Edelgard’s identity as the Flame Emperor as a twist feels inaccurate. If you join the Black Eagles and spend time with her it feels almost obvious, as it’s the natural step to take given how Edelgard sees the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. In the first half of the game, you’re presented with story beat after story beat that openly show the medieval fantasy world to be a place bereft with horrible class inequality and ingrained ways of life held up by the church, the very institution you serve. Much of this inequality comes down to Crests, special marks that, over time, have been used to decide nobility. These Crests are hereditary and lead to women born with Crests often being seen as vessels to give birth to men who can pass on the special powers, an issue seen explicitly with Ingrid’s story. These issues, and more personal traumas like the massacre of her entire family, have turned Edelgard into the cold woman we meet at the beginning of the game. But if you accompany her throughout the first half, we see these horrific realities of the world up close. If you pay attention to the world, then Edelgard’s mission isn’t much of a twist. The reasons behind what Xeecee accurately named her “call to arms” in a 2019 article for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vice</em></a></span><em> </em>are all laid bare for you to see.</p><p>As shown in her school time, Edelgard is the only future leader in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> who is concerned with changing the systems in place in order to benefit the people. The other leaders, Dimitri and Claude, are concerned with retaining their—and their kingdoms’— place in the status quo. They may talk about caring about their people, but it’s in an us vs them mindset that fears losing a place in the upper echelons of a world governed by the church. Through Edelgard, <em>Three Houses</em> gives you the rare chance to do something truly revolutionary as a protagonist. It invites you to actually leave the world of the game a better place than when you found it.</p><figure id="" data-id="0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-recommend-id="image://0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;For their sake, I will build a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned.

As emperor, I will change the world. I swear it.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t a simple thing for Edelgard, either. In many ways she has given up her identity and life in order to pursue change for everyone. Part of the beauty of the Crimson Flower path and leading the Black Eagles during their time at the Officer’s Academy is getting to breathe some humanity back into her after the horrific life she has lived. Again, the downside is that you only see this side of her if you choose to lead the Black Eagles and then follow Edelgard in her revolution. It locks so much of the best writing and character work in the entire game behind so many choices, but in some ways it’s better for it, as it requires you to truly seek it out through your love of Edelgard.<br></p><p>Edelgard remains a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely hated</a></span> character in <em>Three Houses</em>. She is easily painted as an irredeemable villain who causes mass murder, all for the sake of her own goals. Of course, she isn’t perfect, but the game goes to great lengths to show the cost of revolution is high but necessary. Edelgard is sacrificing her own humanity, and it eats away at her. The revolution is not something she takes lightly, and she even confides in you that she worries the cost will be too high in the end. But holding the systems of oppression in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> accountable is something that must be done, and it will mean change for the better. It shouldn’t be overlooked that it is so easy for a particular subset of players to utterly demonize the female lead (if we consider the house heads as leads, which I think is fair to do). At the end of the day, every character in every route is responsible for a long list of deaths and war crimes, but only one of the house leaders has a distinct moral drive behind every action they take.</p><p>For queer players, her route takes on even more meaning if you choose to be the female protagonist of the game. Edelgard is romanceable regardless of gender and in a story of revolution, in which she is fighting to break down oppressive institutions, reading her as queer just clicks. Building a relationship with Edelgard is the central pillar of understanding the moral imperative to fight alongside her. It also, as I previously mentioned, helps to breathe humanity into her in a world that has worked so hard to tear it out. It sounds cliche, but by giving her love and romancing her, you can make the story of revolution all the more poignant. She is not just fighting for a better world for those around her, but so she can be the truest version of herself without judgment.</p><figure id="" data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To Edelgard’s detriment, Crimson Flower is the shortest route in <em>Three Houses</em>. Yet it packs so much remarkable storytelling into a smaller package than its counterparts. It robs her of a true catharsis, relegating the fruits of her labors to epilogue text. Furthermore, each route that follows a different house leader ends with corruption being rooted out from the world of <em>Three Houses</em>, so in the end, many may wonder why Edelgard’s methods were even necessary or justified. But again, even if the world changes regardless of who you choose, Edelgard is the only ruler who sets out with that change in mind as her singular goal. Her devotion to that mission is also what enlightened the other leaders around her, persuading them to eventually work for some level of change, even in the routes in which she is killed for her crimes.<br></p><p><em>Three Houses</em> is a game you’re encouraged to play through many times in order to see all the different routes and permutations, but at the end of the day, if someone asked me what single route they should play, I would answer Crimson Flower. Edelgard is not right about everything, she is not perfect. She is, however, the most compelling and well-written character in <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>. She will never deserve the hate she gets. That was true in 2019 and it is true now, five years later. Edelgard Von Hresvelg, you will always be famous.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Behemoth Upcoming Updates And Games Roadmap Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to craft a character of their own, there will also be an official new playable character, Paint Junior, who uses their imagination to create art and defeat enemies. Painter Boss Paradise will additionally introduce redrawn models for all of the game's playable characters and weapons, but don't worry: The new models can be toggled on or off in the options menu.</p><p dir="ltr">For the studio's platformer BattleBlock Theater, an update for the Steam version will allow for higher frame rates, support for more controller types, better rendering, and higher audio bitrates for improved sound. The game will be coming to modern consoles as well, something also in the works for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid/" data-ref-id="5000-21360">Alien Hominid HD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-507833">Alien Hominid Invasion</a>, which are currently available on Xbox and PC but will soon be coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 too.</p><p dir="ltr">Not to be left out, The Behemoth's quirky strategy title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pit-people/" data-ref-id="5000-310603">Pit People</a>, will also be receiving some quality-of-life improvements, though specific details were not shared.</p><p dir="ltr">No release dates were given for any of these updates, and no additional information was shared in regards to when The Behemoth's next new game would arrive. In a press release, the developer states that all of the aforementioned updates "will be rolling out while the team looks ahead to prototyping and developing new titles."</p><p dir="ltr">The roadmap served as a way to "address several popular far requests from the past 21 years while establishing a new level of transparency with players," according to the press release. The studio's most-recent projects were Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion, both released in 2023.</p>

            <p>Demos were once a cornerstone of PC gaming and they arguably will be again thanks to events like Steam Next Fest. The latest update to Steam seeks to make those free slices of potential delight easier to find for players, and easier to promote for developers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Great Steam Demo Update, as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">the announcement calls it</a>, makes several changes. Demos will now behave differently in your library: you can add them without immediately installing them; they can now be installed even if you already own the full game; and they can be manually removed from your library, or will be automatically removed when uninstalled.
</p>
<p>Demos can also now have their own separate store page, if a developer so chooses. This allows a developer to explain the demo's contents in more detail, add unique screenshots and trailers, and even allows players to write user reviews of the demo.
</p>
<p>All demos will also now appear in more places around the Steam store, acting more like standalone free games.
</p>
<p>When I started my career twenty years ago, it was my job to make coverdiscs (both CDs and a DVD) filled with demos to be stuck to the front of a PC gaming magazine, and to write about the contents of the demos inside the magazine's pages. I got to watch up-close as those demos grew in filesize, becoming hard to fit even on a DVD, and as their creation grew less and less common. It was a terrible shame.
</p>
<p>I imagine there's still debate over whether or not demos help developers sell their game - and I imagine the answer varies wildly depending on the game, the demo, and whether either are any good. As a player, I have little invested in that debate. For me, demos are an unequivocal good: free, hypothetically fun, and great way to avoid spending money on games I wouldn't like. It's great that they've had such a huge revival and now we get to write about them in events like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-2024">Wishlisted</a>.</p>

As the strike commences, many games currently in development will be affected due to the labor strikes. However, one notable game that will not be affected is Rockstar Games' upcoming open-world game, which is undoubtedly one of next year's most highly anticipated titles: Grand Theft Auto 6. </p><p>First <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by Kotaku</a> and independently verified by IGN, Grand Theft Auto 6 is exempt from the video game voice actor strike. Take-Two declined IGN's request for comment. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/strike-1721952790030.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SAG-AFTRA'S video game voice actor strike went into effect at midnight on July 26. | Image Credit: SAG-AFTRA</figcaption></figure></output><p>Additionally, this claim of GTA 6's exemption from the video game voice actors strike can be verified by heading to the SAG-AFTRA database, which includes a search tool allowing SAG-AFTRA members to search for the struck status of video game projects. Below, you can read the message on SAG-AFTRA's website regarding GTA VI's exemption. </p><blockquote>"While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company. If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so." </blockquote><p>GTA 6 is exempt from the video game voice actors strike because games already in production before August 25, 2023, including live service games, are covered by the previous contractual agreement between SAG-AFTRA and gaming companies. However, actors may still choose not to work on the game in solidarity with fellow members and cannot be penalized by employers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 Stills</h3></div></output><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-rockstar-officially-unveils-first-trailer-early-after-leak">officially revealed in December 2023</a>. Its first trailer became a mega-hit for Rockstar Games, becoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-has-already-surpassed-grand-theft-auto-5s-reveal-with-more-than-100-million-views">YouTube's most-viewed video game reveal within 24 hours</a>. Set in the modern-day fictionalized version of Florida, players control Lucia and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-protagonist-isnt-played-by-the-last-of-us-star-troy-baker">an unnamed male</a>, who fans theorize is named Jason. </p><p>Upon its initial reveal, Rockstar confirmed that GTA 6 would be released in 2025. However, Take-Two Interactive would narrow that release window in May 2024, when CEO Strauss Zelnick told IGN in an interview that the company was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">"highly confident"</a> that GTA would not be delayed, while also revealing the game would be released in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. </p><p>While GTA 6 remains technically unaffected by the strikes, that does not mean the gaming industry will feel the effects of this ongoing labor strike.

                <p>Riot's 5v5 hero shooter<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/"> Valorant</a> has now entered open beta on consoles. Anyone playing on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S can join the fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Before the announcement, the only way to play Valorant on console was through a closed beta that players needed to sign up for. In a series of posts made on the<a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1816867027060920540" rel="nofollow "> official Valorant X/Twitter account</a>, the studio explained that console players won't be able to play PC players. However, those on Xbox and PlayStation can join each other's games.</p><p dir="ltr">There'll also be shared cross-progression for PC and console, which will give players full access to everything they've purchased. All progress made towards the battle pass will count towards both platforms. Those who are subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will automatically unlock all agents. The open beta is currently only available in the United States, Canada, Europe, Brazil, and Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Bringing Valorant to console did require a lot of work. As an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/" rel="nofollow "> Xbox Wire post</a> explained, the standard way to shoot on PC was hip firing. This didn't translate well when it came to console, so to combat this, Riot created Focus, a new type of shooting mode that acts like hip fire but with reduced sensitivity.</p><p>If you're jumping into Valorant for the first time, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/12-valorant-tips-to-help-you-master-the-competitive-shooter/2900-5546/#1"> our guide, which details everything you need to know about getting the upper hand</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Double Fine PsychOdyssey episode 33.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FojuFCVg_ng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you have any interest in video game development at all, you owe it to yourself to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/double-fines-new-documentary-about-making-psychonauts-2-is-a-must-watch">watch the documentary from the beginning</a>. Even if you don't care about development or video games, I think it would be compelling to watch a team of sincere, talented people collaborate to make something complicated and joyful. Its to Double Fine's great credit that the documentary frankly depicts several of the things that went wrong on the project, too, from staff disagreements, departures, crunch, and much more.
</p>
<p>This latest episode looks back on those challenges with the benefit of hindsight, first through a series of post-mortem meetings held at Double Fine after Psychonauts 2's release, and then through the lens of the documentary's release. That includes discussion of some of the doc's most dramatic moments, such as the fallout (and fallings out) that followed the hiring and eventual departure of Psychonauts 2's original project lead.
</p>
<p>Double Fine haven't announced a new game in the three years since Psychonauts 2 was released, and there's some discussion of what might be next from the now Microsoft-owned studio. In broad strokes: a return to smaller games, and a doubling-down on being weird, with the ambition of making the weirdest games on Game Pass. </p>

                <p>Activision is shining some light on how it approaches skill-based matchmaking in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Call of Duty</a> multiplayer, and in a detailed <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-matchmaking-intel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the developers of the popular FPS series reveal that the sometimes-controversial practice is still used for a fairly simple reason--fewer players quit under a skill-based system than they do without it.</p><p dir="ltr">The topic of skill-based matchmaking (or SBMM, as it's often abbreviated) in Call of Duty has been a long and ongoing one, with some arguing that behind-the-scenes skill ratings that help determine who matches up with whom should be a thing of the past. Those against SBMM argue that since there are ranked playlists, those who want to be matched with players of equal skill can simply play there, leaving the rest of the game's modes open to a more luck-of-the-draw-type of matchmaking experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - Official Season 5 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">From the blog post, it doesn't seem like Call of Duty will ditch SBMM any time soon, largely because the developers have revealed they have solid data on the effects doing so would have on the game. In a test conducted with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 where one group of players played with the current SBMM rules and another group that played under "loosened skill consideration," the developers found that the group playing with a wider skill gap were "more likely to quit matches in progress and did not return to the game at a higher rate than players with unchanged matchmaking."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also ran another test where skill requirements in matchmaking were actually increased. It had the opposite effect, with players more likely to finish a match, particularly when it came to low-skill players. However, the developer notes that high-skill players were impacted in some negative ways by the stricter skill requirements, and as a result, the changes were not rolled out to the live game.</p><p dir="ltr">"The system strives for team balance, where players are not consistently on the wrong side of blowout matches," the developer states. "Players who frequently experience blowouts are seen to quit matches in progress and the game itself, which negatively impacts the experience for players of all skill levels."</p><p dir="ltr">Should low-skill players leave the game in droves due to being frustrated by blowout matches, it creates an environment where lobbies are largely made up of high-skill players, something the developer states is the case when players go back and play many older Call of Duty titles today.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will always strive to improve our approach to matchmaking to ensure that players of all skill levels are having the best possible experience," the developer states." A healthy player population is good for everyone in the community."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-patch-notes/2900-5631/" data-ref-id="2900-5631">Modern Warfare 3 Season 5 just launched, adding new maps, modes, and weapons</a> to the popular FPS, just in time for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month-report/1100-6524827/" data-ref-id="1100-6524827">arrival on Xbox Game Pass</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 and will be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">launch day for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a>.</p>

			<p>Look North World is a pioneering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">UGC (User Generated Content)</a> game studio and published led by Alexander Seropian, the founder of Bungie and a former executive at Disney have announced that they have managed to raise a total of $4.5M for seed funding. The second round of fundraising for seed funding had contributions from London Venture Partners, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Hasbro, and many more.</p>
<p>Along with the seed funding, Look North World has announced the launch of its Creator Label, a curated program dedicated to supporting and boosting individual creators who build on creative platforms. In total, 15 games are being created with major IP deals, allowing Look North World to invest in accelerating the creation of original games using UGC.</p>
<p>Using the Creator Label, Look North World aims to provide end-to-end support for creators in the UGC gaming sphere. Creators signed to the label will receive guaranteed benefits, such as an advance, long-term ownership of intellectual property, a marketing budget to distribute their contributions, and a team of industry professionals who can help with artistic and technical support.</p>
<p>So far, the first signed content creators to the label are Austin 'TomJank' Rodriguez and Jon 'SightedSloth' Jungemann. TomJank is known for creating Dream Job Tycoon, and SleightedSloth has worked on various tycoon games across the Epic Games Store creation applications.</p>
<p>"Investing in Look North World cements our belief in user-generated content being a core pillar of the future of gaming. As UGC platforms expand and gain market share, talented teams are leveraging them to push boundaries and create diverse, immersive experiences at an unprecedented pace. We invest in people, and Alex and his veteran team are pioneers, notably during previous growth waves of console and mobile. With Look North World they continue to reshape how games are built and published," says Matt Bilbey, Venture Partner at London Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Look North World has a<a href="https://looknorth.world/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> selection of games</a> available at the moment, such as Dream Job Tycoon on Fortnite, the Ark Survival Ascended x Power Rangers Cosmetic Pack, Carrera Coast, Outlaw Corral, and Don't Push the Button, which are all available in Fortnite.</p>
<p>"Look North World is a great partner for the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund, as a company with a foundation of game making know-how and founders who have created blockbusters in traditional games now looking to apply their pedigree and vision to what the new generation of gamers want to play," said Yoyo Yang, Principal of the Bandai Namco Entertainment 021 Fund.</p>

<p>It’s a matter of weeks until Escape from Tarkov ‘wipes’, with Battlestate Games pushing out that regular platform-wide reset that takes everyone back to level pegging. It’s typically one of the most exciting times to be an Escape from Tarkov player, as it usually goes hand-in-hand with sizeable in-game updates such as new maps, weapons, bosses, and quests.</p>



<p>Today, a new event started in Escape from Tarkov – the type of special event that usually takes place <strong>very close </strong>to a wipe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-when-is-tarkov-going-to-wipe">When is Tarkov Going to Wipe?</h2>



<p>We don’t know when Escape from Tarkov will wipe next – all we know is that it’s happening at some point in August.</p>



<p>Today, Battlestate Games deployed a new in-game event to take players one step closer to the next wipe. At the core of this event sits free entry to Labs, arguably the toughest Escape from Tarkov map and a haven for skilled PvPers. Once you’ve gained entry to Labs, you’ll need to complete a strange task handed out by Jaeger. He wants you to kill 23 PMCs and 57 Raiders – there’s a hefty prize for doing so, but it’s a pretty massive ask for the less talented players.</p>



<p>This event runs until July 29, and it’s following on from a recent limited-time quest that saw two traders – Prapor and Peacekeeper – pitted against one another. Traditionally, this won’t be the last special event before a wipe arrives. The best indicator of that is a sudden change to the in-game stores and traders, with the prices for everything going down to a single rouble or so and all the trader ‘rep levels’ being boosted to the maximum tier.</p>



<p>That means that you’ll be able to build the best weapons, secure top armour, and go into battles fully loaded – but then typically the game will wipe just days later. </p>



<p>Be prepared – Escape from Tarkov is wiping soon.</p>
