              <p>The developer behind the slot machine-based indie game <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> has asked fans not to buy it on Xbox, and instead told <em>Kotaku</em> he wants people to<a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"> boycott Microsoft due to the company continuing to support Israel</a> in its violent attacks against Palestine and its people.</p> <p>On December 18, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> creator Dan Dilorio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:n52jsewxgg2zp65ggprctppx/post/3mabikxrjz22q?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost.php">reshared a post</a> about investigative games reporting outlet <em>People Make Games</em> boycotting Xbox due to its involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict. The dev further added that he didn’t want people to buy the slot machine game on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please do not purchase<em> Luck Be a Landlord</em> on Xbox,” posted Dilorio. “I will be making a $10,000 donation to The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund to (hopefully) help offset the revenue the game has generated for Microsoft.”</p>   <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> is a roguelike slot machine game that helped inspire the creation of <em>Balatro</em>. In the game, players try to pay their rent using a slot machine that can be upgraded and tweaked. <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> first launched in 2023 on PC but was ported to consoles earlier this year.</p> <div id=":5b"> <p>“I would love for everyone to give what they can to <a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/">The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund</a>, whether they purchased the game on Xbox or not,” Dilorio told <em>Kotaku</em> via email.&nbsp; “I also encourage those with Game Pass subscriptions to cancel them.”</p> <p>Dilorio isn’t the first indie developer to publicly distance themselves from Xbox and vocally support the ongoing and growing boycott against the company. In April, the developers behind <em>Tenderfoot Tactics&nbsp;</em>pulled the game from the Xbox store in solidarity with the BDS campaign against Israel.</p> <p>“We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months,” said one developer at the time on social media <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-developer-removes-their-game-from-xbox-stores-in-solidarity-with-pro-palestine-boycott">as reported by <em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>The boycott against Israel has continued to cause problems for Xbox and will likely do so moving forward into 2026.</p> </div>

              <p><span>Last year, </span><i><span>The Last of Us </span></i><span>developer Naughty Dog released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-grounded-making-of-documentary-1851196816"><span>documentary on the making of the game’s 2020 sequel</span></a><span> that attempted to discuss the studio’s reported problems with overwork and crunch. The video ended on a note indicating that things had improved, but it sounds like the team is facing a similar struggle with its upcoming PS5 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span> reports that Naughty Dog has had developers working mandatory overtime as it races to complete a demo of the sci-fi action game for Sony to review, despite a planned release date that’s still years away.</span></p> <p><span>The mandatory overtime reportedly began in October, with staff being asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week and logging them on an internal spreadsheet. This was in an effort to get the game’s production back on track after several missed deadlines, though developers were also told not to work more than 60 hours a week.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During this period, a new mandatory return-to-office order was also pushed through, requiring everyone to be onsite at the Santa Monica studio five days a week, rather than the typical three. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>’s sources, employees had to find “alternative care arrangements” for children and pets.</span></p>

 <p><span>This follows older reports that Naughty Dog had hired a new team of producers specifically meant to help alleviate the team’s crunch problems. But according to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>, several of them have already left the company. While select members of the team reportedly worked overtime to finish </span><i><span>Intergalactic</span></i><span>’s debut trailer back in 2024, this new overtime requirement has applied to “most” of the staff.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Management reportedly told workers the company will return to its usual three-day in-office requirement in January, with a more detailed breakdown coming after the team returns from holiday break. The </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> story signs off with an ironic anecdote, saying the team was given metal coins to commemorate the game’s ongoing development, which included text of a quote from the game, “The suffering of generations must be endured to achieve our divine end.”</span></p> <p><span>Reports of Naughty Dog crunching date back years, with </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i><span>’s development being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962"><span>one of the most notorious</span></a><span>. Back in 2023, Naughty Dog </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-ps5-playstation-sony-last-us-part-3-layoffs-1850893794"><span>cut dozens of contractors</span></a><span> roughly a year before </span><i><span>Intergalactic </span></i><span>was announced at the 2024 Game Awards.</span></p>

<p>Naughty Dog is forcing the developers working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet to work overtime. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>In a story published on Thursday afternoon, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier states</a> that the studio behind games like The Last of Us and Uncharted has <strong>“been pushing its staff to work long hours to get ready for an upcoming review of the demo by its parent company.”</strong></p>







<p>It’s said that requests began in October for staff to work at least eight extra hours per week with it being logged via spreadsheet. This was done to make up for time lost due to missed deadlines.</p>



<p><strong>“The employees were instructed not to work more than 60 hours a week,” </strong>Schreier writes. <strong>“Staff were also told to return to the office five days a week for this period, up from three previously, sending some employees scrambling to find alternative care arrangements for children and pets.”</strong></p>



<p>Those who spoke to Schreier under the condition of anonymity are worried that, if there’s already mandatory overtime over 18 months away from release, it might get worse in the coming months. As of writing, Intergalactic is scheduled to release in mid-2027. </p>



<p>Sony and Naughty Dog also declined to comment on the claims.</p>

                <p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog recently mandated that workers return to the office five days per week--up from three--and had been pushing staff to work "long hours" to get a demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> ready to show off to Sony higher-ups.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work "a minimum of eight extra hours a week" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. "This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the "mandated overtime" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo.</p><p>Sony and Naughty Dog declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg.</p><p>The report added that Naughty Dog established a new team of producers in 2021 with the directive of helping cut back on instances of extended overtime, or crunch. "Many" of these people have since left the company, the report said.</p><p>Finally, the report said Naughty Dog is aiming to release Intergalactic in mid-2027, and that workers are fearful that "overtime requirements will get worse" as the game's release draws closer.</p><p>On the topic of developers at Naughty Dog crunching, studio head Neil Druckmann said in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-director-on-crunch-theyre-gonna-w/1100-6478208/" data-ref-id="1100-6478208">June 2020 interview</a> with GQ, "They're gonna work very hard. We need to put some guardrails [in] so they don't injure themselves, but I don't think we could prevent them from working hard and still make the kind of games we make."</p><p>Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells said in 2021 that its workers want to work more than 40 hours per week. Keeping people in the office only 40 hours a week "would frustrate people to no end," he said, adding that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-execs-push-back-against-unions-say-they-may-not-solve-crunch/1100-6495708/" data-ref-id="1100-6495708">unionization won't help.</a></p><p>Intergalactic is a new IP from Naughty Dog, which is notable given the company has mostly worked on sequels to its Uncharted and The Last of Us series for the past two decades. The sci-fi game aims to be Naughty Dog's "wildest, most creative story yet," and focuses on the character Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who becomes stranded on a planet called Sempiria.</p><p>Naughty Dog has multiple internal development teams, and a second team could be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-collabs-cosmetics-gameplay-changes-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-7362/" data-ref-id="2900-7362">Winterfest celebration</a> kicked off with the usual array of map and gameplay changes in Battle Royale and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-free-cosmetics-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-7363/" data-ref-id="2900-7363">piles of free stuff in the Winterfest cabin</a>. But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_1">Drop 1</a><ul><li><a href="#Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</h2><p>The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.</p><h3 id="Drop_1">Drop 1</h3><h4 id="Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</h4><p>Every chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.</p><h4 id="Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</h4><p>This quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient.</p><h4 id="Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</h4><p>You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.</p><h2 id="Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</h2><p>In addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.</p><p>Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=11838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbrite Slasher pickaxe</a>, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.</p>

He has a point. Why did his comments attract little furor then but rise to a firestorm now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just Larian asking that question. I've heard developers who aren't AI enthusiasts express frustration over the backlash. They argue his comments about how generative AI can be used seem reasonable.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I see their point. But watching the reaction from developers I see something more powerful: a backlash not only over the multi-faceted issues with generative AI, but to how leaders like Vincke are instituting the tech.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">How poor leadership slows down game development</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers are tired of being told they need to use generative AI">Developers are tired of being told they need to use generative AI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Across several interviews, Vincke has presented some interesting use-cases for generative AI, positioning some of its implementation as a new tech tool and not a time-saver. In an interview with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegamer.com/swen-vincke-interview-larian-divinity-generative-ai/">The Gamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he explained the studio can automate some QA processes and improve motion capture data processing using tools trained on its own data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In speaking with Bloomberg and on social media, Vincke has alluded to the company using it for reference images in concept art, placeholder in-game text, and producing internal PowerPoints. Vincke said workers at the studio are "more or less OK" with the way it's being used—but Bloomberg reports that there are developers inside Larian who've pushed back against the use of generative AI. Former employees have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440?s=20">validated</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> this account in posts on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">Bluesky</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This disconnect is what's driving anger among professionals. For the last two years developers have watched their employers herald the arrival of generative AI as a game-changer for the industry and mandated their adoption. Resisting these mandates for ethical or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devs-are-more-worried-than-ever-that-generative-ai-will-lower-the-quality-of-games">quality&nbsp;</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">concerns is sometimes ill-received by management.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Workers are then placed between a rock and a hard place. They could quit, but then they'd be looking for work in a terrible hiring environment, competing with their peers for a scant number of positions, many at companies also pushing for the use of generative AI. So they bite their tongue, grind their teeth, and muddle through, trying to make the most of a frustrating position.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many developers are put in this position by leaders who either haven't worked on a game for years or who come from strictly from an executive background. They are forced to watch as people who don't have to use these tools for complex tasks decide their fate. Vincke is the rare CEO who directs his company's games, but even with that perspective, his position as CEO fundamentally means he faces different day-to-day complexities than his employees.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And with the power to hire—and fire—workers, saying "no" to his demands is rather difficult. That became more clear as the game writing community finally spoke out about Larian's hiring practices.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Larian's hiring practices put pressure on some new hires">Larian's hiring practices put pressure on some new hires</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Larian, to its credit, is an international company that considers employees from all over the world, but many of its job descriptions requiring workers be on-site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On social media, developers raised the idea that if you land a job with Larian—a celebrated studio behind one of the game industry's most beloved single-player titles—you may be putting a lot on the line to land your dream job. If it doesn't work out, you're not just out looking for a new gig, you can be miles away from home, in a foreign country, staring down the barrel of a relocation process that could cost thousands of dollars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Its influence was made clear to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/unburntwitch.com/post/3ma4p47aqts22">a number</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/damonreece.com/post/3ma4pnjx2mc22">game writers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acampwriting.com/post/3ma4vrws5a22a">narrative designers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> who came forward on social media about their alleged experience interviewing with the company. They described a 6-month long hiring process requiring 12 interviews and an unpaid writing test where they needed to not just prove their writing skills but also show they could implement an in-game quest (some writers I've spoken with at game industry events have said discontent over these tests has spread privately for months).</span></p><p>Image via Larian Studios</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Imagine being a writer who jumps through all those hoops, only to arrive at the company and see that leadership wants you to use generative AI to create placeholder text, something usually marked by phrases like "TKTK,""[INSERTPLACEHOLDERHERE]," or "FFFFFFFFFF" to ensure it's fixed before the game ships. How comfortable would you be pushing back against that?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you aren't an international hire, Larian's ability to implement such a strenuous test shows the strength it can exert over workers. And even if the game industry hadn't spent 3 years laying off thousands of developers, its reputation would make it a highly desirable place to work. And when you land a dream job like that, and management dictates you have to use a tool you have deep concerns over—of course that's going to breed frustration and resentment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those power dynamics create kindling for this kind of conflict to spark and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">they're not unique to any particular company. This story is playing out everywhere in the video game industry. If people have reason to fear speaking their minds, how can you be sure they're as enthusiastic about generative AI as you are?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="AI backlash is about leadership and power as well as ethics">AI backlash is about leadership and power as well as ethics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Swen, if you're reading this—I truly sympathize with your position.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making games is challenging on a good day, and every developer I know wants to find tools that make their work easier. Some of the backlash has taken your words out of context, and I've no doubt some of your subordinates are finding AI tools helpful in their workflows.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But if Bloomberg's reporting is correct, and Larian employees are pushing back about using generative AI, that's not just stubbornness. That's a real sign these tools aren't working.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was being sincere when I dashed off my one-word post on Bluesky. I feel the exhaustion of everyone in game development told by their leaders that AI will be game-changing technology that we have to adopt to stay ahead of the curve. It's not enough to promise you're not using it to replace jobs or that AI-generated content won't appear in the final game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Promises can be broken.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've spent 2025 thinking about how the game industry needs </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development">leaders worthy of their titles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who can strike the balance between setting a vision and getting out of their team's way.

              <p>Developer Mark Ffrench has carved out something of a unique niche on Steam, regularly releasing fill-a-pix logic puzzle games of enormous scale and surprising depth. Among others in 2024 there was <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2024/11/proverbs/"><em>Proverbs</em></a>, a wall-sized puzzle based on Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s painting Netherlandish Proverbs, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3380760/2024_Mosaic_Retrospective/"><em>2024: Mosaic Retrospective</em></a>, which contained dozens of interlocking images recalling major events from the whole year. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Pharaohs</em></a> earlier this year, we now have the most elaborate entry yet:&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>—a game that combines the same logic puzzle conceit with a pixelated point-n-click adventure.</p> <p>Right, describing a logic puzzle is always the most stultifying and joy-destroying process, so please bear with me for a moment before we get back to the fun stuff:</p> <p>To get everyone on the same page, fill-a-pix is one of the many logic puzzle types to come from puzzle maestros <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx">Conceptis</a>, where you fill in a grid based on&nbsp;<em>Minesweeper</em> rules. Each number in the grid indicates the number of cells that should be shaded in the three-by-three grid of which it sits in the center. So, a “6” on the side of a puzzle means all six cells are shaded, while a “0” in the middle means you can eliminate its nine cells from any overlapping clues. The more you play, the more familiar you become with certain patterns, such as the consequences of having a “6” and a “3” in two adjacent cells (you have to shade the three cells to the left of the 6, and eliminate the three to the right of the 3), and so many more besides. RIGHT, OK, WE’RE DONE.</p>

  <p>The way Ffrench implements this is by creating enormous mosaics that are segmented into individual puzzles, and rewarding completion of most with little pop-up information. In&nbsp;<em>Proverbs</em> it was details on each of the proverbs depicted in the vast painting. In&nbsp;<em>2024</em> it was details of the events of that year. But in&nbsp;<em>Mosaic of the Strange</em>, it’s all rather different. The details that pop up are documents, mostly about conspiratorial mysteries, because in this game you’re playing as FBI agents investigating a murder.</p>

 <p>Agents Cullen and Brady are called in after a body is found in gruesome condition, with the circumstances of the man’s death a crazed muddle of mysteries. And rather than solving multiple puzzles on a single wall, here the process of completing the grids is how you’re exploring the items in the rooms. OK, yes, it’s spurious. You’re not actually playing a point-n-click in the sense that you’re actually deducing anything, but with each item solved you gain a document pertaining to a peculiar subject, perhaps cryptids or UFOs or mysterious disappearances from lonely lighthouses, which all add up to evidence to stick up on the pinboard in your office. You also visit the coroner, the murder victim’s apartment, and elsewhere, with a total of 144 puzzles and documents to find.</p>

 <p>Various items prompt conversations between the characters, which makes what would otherwise be a more sterile puzzle game feel much more alive and in-depth, and the result is something absorbing both in narrative and in puzzling. Ffrench has nailed the way in which he delivers the challenges, with smart, context-sensitive hints if you want them, and a prompt that will pop up if you’ve gone too horribly wrong without noticing. Also, in this game, you can hugely change the difficulty of the puzzles in a way that I adore.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654620"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654620">© Mark Ffrench / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You can make things so simple that you’re basically painting by numbers, or in increments make it so challenging that every puzzle is a head-scratching ordeal on the scale of <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/02/tametsi/"><em>Tametsi</em></a>. I’ve mostly settled on one notch down from the latter, but it’s fun to scale it up to the hardest point and really have to scour for every super-complex pattern of numbers. Even better, you can change that difficulty at any point, midway through solving any grid.</p> <p>OK, I completely nerded out there, but trust me, you’ve never played anything like&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444650/Mosaic_of_the_Strange/"><em>Mosaic of the Strange</em></a>, and you’ll get&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of entertainment for your $12. I can’t wait to see what Ffrench does next, especially if these games continue to evolve in their current direction.</p>

<p>The Coalition has given a brief but promising update on Gears of War: E-Day, which it claims is its ‘most ambitious’ title. While no release date has been announced for the prequel, it seems fans will have much to look forward to in 2026.</p>



<p>The Gears of War series, also known as Gears, has been going strong since 2006, almost 20 years ago. Following a ragtag group of soldiers, you’ll shoot (and chainsaw) your way through the parasitic Locust. With five titles, including a few spin-offs, the third-person shooter has become a staple for Xbox. While no sequel to 2019’s Gears 5 has been revealed, a prequel starring Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago, called Gears of War: E-Day, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in 2024</a>. A 2026 launch is still on the books and, now, the team has provided some new comments on the anticipated title.</p>







<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day-to-play-like-gears-but-play-like-new-says-developers">Gears of War: E-Day to “Play Like Gears, But Play Like New”, Says Developers</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/#gow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year-end article from Xbox</a>, many of the teams of 2025’s biggest games, like The Outer Worlds 2 and South of Midnight, discussed them and what they are looking forward to in 2026. One of the interviewees was Mike Crump, Studio Head at The Coalition for Gears of War: Reloaded. Asked about what the studio is looking forward to the most in 2026, Crump said the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Next year marks the 20th anniversary of Gears of War, and we can’t think of a bigger way to celebrate than with the release of&nbsp;Gears of War: E-Day</strong>,” states Clump in the interview. “<strong>This is our most ambitious game yet, entirely built from scratch in Unreal Engine 5 to feel like Gears and play like new. This is a return to our roots as Marcus &amp; Dom face the Locust for the first time ever. It’s the best place to jump into the Gears universe and we can’t wait to share more next year.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As mentioned before, Gears of War: E-Day is planning to release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime</a> in 2026. No gameplay or additional trailers have been released since 2024. Still, the team at The Coalition and People Can Fly seem adamant the game will live up to expectations. Seeing as Gears 5 was an ambitious title in the series, E-Day may be what fans have been waiting for.</p>

			<p>Studio Wildcard's latest ARK: Survival Ascended expansion, Lost Colony, is now out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S players, as the latest expansion closes the gap between the stories of the previous Extinction expansion and the upcoming ARK 2, while adding a host of new creatures, seven new biomes, and more.</p>



<p>Lost Colony takes players to Arat Prime, where humanity made its final stand. You'll begin your journey in the Necrocene, a post-cataclysmic era that has plunged the entire southern pole of the Earth into darkness. It's here, beneath the snow, the ice, and under the shroud of night, where the Lost Colony continues to survive below its energy shields. </p>



<p>Energy shields that are powered by radioactive Red Element, which is also the source of what's keeping the Earth a broken planet. Which is how the Lost King wants to keep, to maintain his rule. It's then your choice to go the way of the lost king and succumb to his tyranny, or try to oppose him and hold on to your humanity.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Lost Colony 'Ossidon' Spotlight" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtcKl-NNnLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The release of this expansion rounds out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3720100/ARK_Lost_Colony_Expansion_Pass/">Lost Colony expansion pass</a> that Studio Wildcard announced and kicked off earlier this year, which was also when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-gets-ps5-pro-patch-with-pssr-support-ue5-5-upgrade-and-10-year-anniversary/">received a major graphical update across consoles and PC</a>, including improvements that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">took advantage of PlayStation's PSSR and PS5 Pro</a>.</p>



<p>Across the seven new biomes introduced, you'll experience the overwhelming and oppressive metropolis of the Lost King's domain, the arctic perimeter of the Tundra, the bioluminescent flowers and fauna of the Twilight Forest that's far more dangerous than it looks, the eerie Dark Forest that leads to even more dangers beyond what lurks in its woods. </p>



<p>There's also the Caldera, a volcanic crater with a massive sacred ring dedicated to the Lost King, hot springs which you'll find across the map in different concentrations, and aberrant crash sites where you'll have to avoid toxic sludge. So, cheery places all in all.</p>



<p>Across these new biomes you'll find 13 new creatures, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veilwyn</li>



<li>Solwyn</li>



<li>Malwyn</li>



<li>Ossidon</li>



<li>Gloon</li>



<li>Desmodus</li>



<li>Cryolophosaurus</li>



<li>Gigadesmodus</li>



<li>Aureliax</li>



<li>Thralls</li>



<li>Gargoyles</li>



<li>Neophytes</li>



<li>Revenants</li>
</ul>



<p>It's a fairly sizable expansion for ARK players to dig into while they wait for ARK 2, which doesn't seem to be arriving anytime soon. In fact, Studio Wildcard <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">confirmed today</a> that it won't be arriving until 2028, with an expansion in 2027 giving players their first taste of what the sequel will be like.</p>

<h2>How To Play Wordle</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green letters</strong> are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li><strong>Yellow letters</strong> are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>



<li><strong>Gray letters</strong> are not in the word at all.</li>
</ul>



<p>The goal is to guess the word in as few tries as possible. Daily puzzles keep players coming back for more, making it a fun brain exercise and a popular online trend.</p>



<p>Wordle can only be played on the New York Times website. There is currently no app for you to download the official game.</p>

<li><strong>Hint 4:</strong> The word looks unusual because it relies more on <strong>consonant repetition</strong> than vowel variety.</li>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards included a reveal trailer for NO LAW, a cyberpunk first-person shooter from developer Neon Giant and publisher Krafton that’s coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The trailer gave us a first look at the sleazy, lawless city of Port Desire and ended on a line that hints at the game’s tone: “Reap what you sow.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004339-1-1765306650974.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Grey Harker, a seasoned military veteran who barely survived his last deployment. So he decided to leave war behind to lead a life of peace and gardening, but of course, that peaceful life wasn’t in the cards. Trouble came knocking on his door (or more like bulldozing through it), and now it’s time for some payback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trouble isn’t exactly rare in Port Desire. As the trailer says, it’s a city with no laws and no oversight. It’s located on the coast where the borders of three nations meet, leading to a melting pot of both people and environments. There are seedy areas soaked in neon, tall buildings that stretch into the smog-filled sky, as well as lush areas where the jungle has started encroaching on the city. And you’ll see all of it as you travel across the dense open-world city.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/20251119004039-1-1765306575582.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mayors have used violence and intimidation to establish a kind of order, but it’s tenuous at best. Everyone is out for themselves, justice is self-defined, and you’re seemingly always one step away from crossing the wrong person. In this den of danger and vice, Grey’s decisions are up to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The open-ended story of NO LAW evolves depending on the decisions you make. Will you help and protect those who need it? Or will you take what you want when you want it, whoever gets in your way be damned? These decisions have consequences, and each decision and consequence compound on each other to make each playthrough different. After all, “reap what you sow” doesn’t just apply to the people who’ve wronged Grey. It also applies to you, the player. This is the kind of story where it won’t be possible to see every path and outcome in one playthrough, and your relationships will be shaped by your choices.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/rooftop-infiltration-1765392744132.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Grey’s morality isn’t the only thing you’ll have control over. It’ll also be up to you how to approach combat, with several tools at your disposal. Having been in the military, Grey has training in gunplay, stealth, and hacking, but you’ll be the one to decide if he should specialize in one of these paths or be a jack-of-all-trades. He can stick to the shadows and strategically eliminate foes, use devices and hacking to outsmart them, or say to hell with all that and just rush in guns blazing, driven purely by rage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer shows some of that in action, including sneaking through vents to get the drop on enemies from above, using a device to map a room, and facing a giant mech in a 1-on-1 shootout in the street using explosives in the environment. You can also see in the trailer that environments are built with verticality in mind, providing ample opportunity for both catching enemies unawares and violently kicking them off elevated surfaces to their deaths.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/impact-screenshots-meleekick4-1765306650974.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first look at NO LAW, but there are sure to be many more details revealed in the future.

            <guid>1387555</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch port of 1–4-player survival game Oppidum is officially out, completing its list of platforms after it came to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oppidum was created by Spanish indie developer EP Games with a team so small it only has one programmer, though you wouldn’t know it from the scope of the game. It has more than 40 hours of story content and a ton of features. It takes place on the once beautiful and magical island of Insule, but now corruption has spread across it and its creatures. And you're the hero who comes to break the curse that looms over the island.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll establish a camp that’s your safe space, then explore the island’s woods, swamps, and caves to try to locate the source of the corruption. These areas are full of creatures you’ll need to deal with, some of which are still touched by the magic that imbues the island.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is real-time and you’ll often face groups of enemies, so you need to pay attention to the skills of each to figure out which ones to take out first. For example, one enemy might charge you with its shield raised and seem like the most immediate threat. But it could be protecting a nearby healer, so you’ll need to avoid the aggressive attacker and take out the healer first.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-illi-1765998641262.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies will drop resources, and you can gather others by chopping down trees, taking a pickaxe to rocks, or opening treasure chests (some of which are locked until you clear the surrounding area of enemies). You’ll notice that after chopping down a tree, a glowing silhouette of it will remain. That means it will eventually regrow in that same spot, powered by the energy of the island. With the materials you gather, you can construct buildings, craft tools, upgrade your weapons, plant and tend crops, take care of animals, and cook meals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you venture across the island, you’ll meet and build relationships with its inhabitants. They’ll have new quests for you, and as you help them, they’ll help you in return. They’ll move the story forward and inform you about local customs and lore, deepening your connection to the world around you. And completing their quests can score you rewards like increased health and blueprints to improve your camp and equipment, so it’s worth helping everyone you find. As your gear improves, you’ll be able to tackle new areas, where you’ll find new residents to help, new mysteries to solve, and new information to uncover.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-oppidum-sunset-01-1765998691388.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing objectives can also open up unexpected new possibilities. For example, when you defeat a boss, it’ll unlock its Altars, where you can make offerings to get new upgrades. That includes things like expanding your inventory, increasing your health, increasing how many of one item can be included in a stack, and more. This gameplay loop guarantees that through Oppidum’s 40+ hours of content, there’s always something new to discover and new goals to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can do all of this solo or with up to three other players at the same time. There’s cross-play between all platforms, with options for shared or private playthroughs. A shared game allows everyone to invite new people, nobody can be kicked out, all players can connect at any time (meaning you don’t need a particular person to be online in order to play), and if someone leaves the realm, their slot can’t be used by someone else. A private game is created by one person, and only they have the power to invite or kick out other players. It’s also only possible to join the game while the creator is online, but if someone leaves the realm or is kicked, they can be replaced by another player.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-sights-coloredforest-1765998802952.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The experience can also be fully customized, including difficulty level and gameplay options. Difficulty can be altered with multiple different presets to tailor it to exactly what you’re looking for. If you just want stress-free gameplay where you gather resources and build up your camp without facing any real danger, you can turn on the Relaxed option, which makes it impossible for you to die. On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking for more of a challenge, you can activate Hardcore mode, which makes enemies much tougher and survival mechanics harsher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to get into more nitty gritty gameplay options, you can do that too. You can change things like enemies’ aggro range and how long an in-game day lasts. And there are accessibility options like disabling the need to hold buttons, adjusting durability settings for your tools and gear (which includes turning off the durability system altogether), simplifying fishing, and several more. The breadth of options earned Oppidum the Best Accessibility award at Spain’s Iris Games Awards, so needless to say it’s one of the game’s strongest features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/screenshot-new-update1-2-0-1765998769515.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch launch of Oppidum also includes the recently released Patch 1.2.0, which added a bunch of new features and content. The headlining additions are two new minigames. Beach Pong is what it sounds like, and you can play against a friend or bennies, the island’s native creatures. In Battle Arena, you can earn rewards for fighting off waves of enemies. You can play in co-op with up to four players, or compete against each other in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The patch also added a new cue to let you know the right time to parry an enemy, a “snap to grid” option during building construction, a new pause feature, and lots more.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-may-get-season-2-thanks-to-super-response-from-players/1100-6536110/" data-ref-id="1100-6536110">sold a million copies in just 10 days</a>, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-of lists for the year.</a> That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it.</p><p>"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit," writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time.</p><p>Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things," he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBXNczRvheI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vBXNczRvheI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The industry was collapsing … We were right there," he said, adding that without contract work paying the bills, "we would have died three years ago." For years, the project mostly met rejection. “You have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven f---ing years," Shorette added, while Herman recalls being told, "This is dumb, don't do it."</p><p>Dispatch was also not always the game players recognize now. It began life as a live-action interactive TV project before COVID shut that version down. Early drafts were darker and more limited, focused on a single hero rather than a full team. Over time, the game evolved into a lighter and broader experience, shifting toward the dispatch system and the group of misfit superheroes that define it today. Even Robert, the main protagonist, wasn't voiced by Aaron Paul--actor Rahul Kohli was in line to take the role. For his part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saros/">Kohli stars in Saros</a>, which is scheduled to launch next April.</p><p>Now that Dispatch is out and doing well, the pressure has changed as Shorette compares it to a musician following up a debut album. "You have your whole life to write your first album and eight months to write your second." But after taking an absurdly long time to launch one season, Dispatch is no longer starting from nothing--and that makes a much faster follow-up possible.</p><p>Dispatch is out now on PS5 and PC. It launches January 28 for Switch and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It has been a big week for Larian Studios, which just announced its upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> to tons of fervor. Unfortunately, a lot of the week since the announcement has consisted of members of the studio, including its CEO Swen Vincke, fighting online about the team's current attitude towards AI tools in games development following an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Now, after a week of backlash, Larian is hoping to clear some of the air around Divinity and its use of AI. In a statement shared on Twitter, Vincke writes, "It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.<br>Larian’s DNA is agency.

(@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Vincke continues, "Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possible make."</p><p>To that end, Vincke states that it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies," but also claims that any aspect of the team's evolving processes that fails to "align with who we are" can and will be changed.</p><p>To clarify matters even more, and likely to take a bit of heat of off Vincke himself, Larian will be holding an AMA after the holidays. Representative of other departments at the studio will be present to field questions "about Divinity and our dev process directly." A date has yet to be announced, but will be shared in the new year.</p><p>In case you might've missed it, Vincke shared that Larian was openly embracing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI tools</a> for its development processes on Divinity. Though he stated that no AI work would be in thh game itself ("Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," Vincke told Bloomberg), Larian devs are, per his comments, using AI to insert placeholder text and generate concept art for the heavily anticipated RPG.</p><p>In response to the news that generative AI is being used on Divinity, Larian has come under fire from fans and other developers online. In response to the backlash, Vincke initially stated, "Holy f**k guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," and shared that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking.</p><p>Vincke, and Larian's, position on AI is hardly a surprise. Earlier this year, similar comments were made in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a> where Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do."</p>

              <p>Bethesda Game Studios may have a reputation for putting out bug-ridden games with barely functioning UIs and then leaving it all for modders to fix, but it generally does this with stunningly wonderful games in which tolerating the jank is more than worthwhile. <em>Starfield</em>, however, is the studio’s first big first-party miss since, wow, 2006’s <i>IHRA Drag Racing: Sportsman Edition</i>. What’s more striking is that the space-faring epic has, since its September 6, 2023 release, put out a single desultory expansion pack, and that was well over a year ago now. New rumors of a rejuvenated version to accompany the game’s arrival on PS5 next year do little to squash the sense that the disappointing game has become a low priority for its creators.</p> <p><em>Starfield</em> released to widespread disappointment <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351">just over two years ago</a>, followed by the most peculiarly barren post-launch period of any Bethesda game in recent memory. After a year of doldrums, the reveal of that first expansion—<em>Shattered Space—</em>looked so promising. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">At an early showing during Gamescom</a>, the horror vibes of the new content appeared compelling, and it felt like this could be the game’s new beginning. But instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-metacritic-steam-reviews-long-1851664605">the DLC was absolutely slated by reviewers</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-steam-reviews-negative-1851672655">players</a>, only further cementing the game’s reputation as a dud.</p>

 <p>Of course, because this is Bethesda, people still held out hope. While&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> was developed by a different internal team (Zenimax Online Studios), that game had the most abysmal beta and launched in 2014 in a pretty crappy state, but vast amounts of work were put in to turn it around, and it’s now a beloved MMO that still thrives a decade later. Surely, some might have reasonably thought, the same kind of effort would be put into <em>Starfield</em>, bringing about the same reversal of fortune? Surely we could expect to see a trickle of new quests, plots, and incremental improvements until it was panel-beaten into a game to place alongside <em>Skyrim</em> and&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>? Yet since <em>Shattered Space</em>‘s arrival last year, we’ve had diddly-squat.</p>

  <p>The whole of 2025 has passed without not just any new content for the game, but not even the announcement of anything to come. Instead (apart from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zknfAghd-s">a video promise</a> that an unspecified new expansion was in the works), all we’ve heard are <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">rumors that the game is being prepared for a 2026 PlayStation 5 release</a> following Microsoft’s decision to abandon console exclusivity, but without any reason provided as to why PS5 players should want it any more than anyone else. Now, word is out that the PlayStation release will coincide with a “2.0” version of <em>Starfield</em> that will also come to Xbox and PC. But even this might need to be met with muted hope.</p>

 <p>Via <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/starfield-improvements-were-showcased-in-a-closed-door-event-for-version-2-0-rumour"><em>Gaming Bolt</em></a>, leaks have appeared of the revamped version of the game, shown to various influencers and the like in a closed-door showcase. Fan-run X account Starfield News <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldNews/status/2001248212104175785">posted</a> to say the event recently took place, with the claim that it was “making those who attended very excited for the future of the game.” However, YouTuber Luke Stephens posted to X to say he’d spoken to a number of people who attended, and that people should “temper expectations.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've had a few people reach out who claim to have either been present at the event or helped put it on. They are consistent in the following ways:</p> <p>Temper expectations. Things are being improved but from what I'm hearing this probably isn't a Cyberpunk 2.0 scale update. <a href="https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC">https://t.co/fjHpMCSadC</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427067540509080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Things are being improved,” Stephens says, “but from what I’m hearing this probably isn’t a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk&nbsp;</em>2.0 scale update.” That’s a reference to the way CD Projekt entirely overhauled the disastrously poor launch version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> to make it one of the best-loved RPGs of all time, and Bethesda can’t really fall short of that if they want to save things.</p>

 <p>Bethesda’s complete silent about all of this, with even the PS5 version’s existence never officially announced, speaks volumes about how little interest there must be in giving players a reason to get excited. That’s on top of the failure to put out any new content in a year. In fact, <em>Starfield</em> is barely getting patched these days, with only two updates in the whole of 2025, both just adding stability fixes, one in May and then the slightest update imaginable in July. The latter was accompanied with the missive, “Looking ahead, we’re continuing work on future updates and will share more about the exciting things we have planned for <em>Starfield</em> in the coming months.”</p>

 <p>Spoiler: they didn’t.</p> <p>We have no official confirmation of this closed-door presentation of a&nbsp;<em>Starfield 2.0</em>, and have asked Bethesda if it can say whether this took place—we’ll update should we get a reply. We’ve also asked about why there’s been so little information and no new content throughout 2025.</p> <p>But even if a dramatically improved revamp appears at some point in 2026 (and <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427071151804565">Luke Stephens suggests</a> it could come significantly later in the year than people have hoped), might it already be too late?&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s dismal launch was not because the game itself was inherently bad, but because it ran so atrociously, with console versions so poor that it was withdrawn from sale by Sony itself. People still wanted to get at the game that was being obscured by the huge technical issues. A year and a half later, the game was finally in a state where it could run properly on console, at which point it was embraced and adored.</p> <p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>‘s shortcomings</a> aren’t a result of technical issues (although those are present, with rumors that the loading screens are to be improved in the supposed 2.0 version), but rather the way its breadth came at the cost of depth, a vastness that doesn’t hold together as a coherent whole, meaning the trademark Bethesda wonkiness becomes far more of an issue. It’s hard to see how this can be rescued without a wealth of cohesive new content, and new content appears to be the very last thing this game is getting. That the whole of 2025 could have gone by without a single significant addition speaks incredibly poorly of Bethesda’s interest in those who bought the game and maintained hope.</p>

 <p>I get that. I can only imagine how awful it is to have spent so many years putting in so much love and effort building something so vast and intricate, only for it not to pull together in a satisfactory way. I wouldn’t want to keep having to plug away at it either, and would be far more interested to move on to <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-new-vegas-2-fo3-remaster-starfield-dlc-1851544120"><em>Fallout V</em></a>. It’s OK to release a game and then move on. But if that’s what’s happening, you can’t be telling your dedicated fanbase about “the exciting things” that are coming up, before just disappearing into a hole.</p> <p>Perhaps 2026 will reveal a&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em> that’s worth reinstalling, and finally I’ll be able to click with a game I’ve failed to connect with after three attempts. I really hope so. But it remains astonishing that 2025 saw nothing at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Days after his comments on AI ignited a firestorm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">Larian Studios cofounder Swen Vincke</a> has elaborated on the RPG maker’s current philosophy on the controversial technology, with plans for an AMA next year to address fan concerns in more detail.</p> <p>“Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make,” he posted <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">on X on Thursday</a>. “In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The new statement comes days after Larian began facing a heated backlash over the studio’s experimentation with generative AI. Vincke <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> the company was using it for some placeholder text, meeting presentations, and concept art references. He was adamant that it was not being used to undercut human creativity and would not appear in finished games like Larian’s recently revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845">RPG sequel <em>Divinity</em></a>.</p>

 <p>But many fans <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934">were disappointed, and some even outraged</a>, citing ethical concerns around how AI relies on copying existing artists’ work and worries about Larian’s critically acclaimed output becoming marred by the introduction, even if only a little bit, of AI slop into the development pipeline.</p>   <p>“Holy fuck guys we’re not ‘pushing hard’ for or replacing concept artists with AI,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">r</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912">esponded Vincke</a> at the time on X. “We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.”</p> <p>The controversy surrounding the studio’s stance on AI didn’t subside, however. Vincke later updated his social media profile signaling that he was listening to the feedback and planning a new response. While the CEO’s latest statement doesn’t walk back any of his prior commitments to explore how AI could potentially benefit Larian’s design process, he’s promised further context about his thoughts on AI and exactly how the studio is using it in a January AMA on Reddit.</p> <p>Here’s Vincke’s full statement:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</p> <p>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p> <p>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p> <p>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</p> <p>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Update 12/18/2025, 2:10 p.m. ET: Added more context.</em></p>

                <p>The new Apple AirPods Pro 3 launched earlier this year, but the wireless earbuds are already seeing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a limited-time price cut at Amazon</a>, where you can snag a pair for $199. That's 20% off its normal $249 price tag and one of the lowest prices we've seen so far. The AirPods Pro 3 build upon the premium sound quality and feature set of previous models, offering better active noise cancelation (ANC), a longer battery life, and new functionality like auto-translation. If you're looking for a last-minute holiday gift or are looking to treat yourself to an upgrade, this is a great opportunity to pick them up.</p><div title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5295" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Apple AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$199 (was $249)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>As mentioned above, the AirPods 3 sport several upgrades over the previous models, including improved ANC.

The current list of supported languages includes English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Support for Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese languages is coming soon.</p><p>Other upgrades include an improved soundscape that makes audio sound richer and clearer, built-in heart rate sensors that can track how many calories you burn across dozens of exercises, and seamless connectivity with other iOS devices. The earbuds are also lightweight and come with five pairs of silicone ear tips. Battery life lasts up to eight hours on a full charge with ANC activated, and they come with a charging case that quickly recharges the battery.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you don't need super high-quality earbuds, you can get a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods 4 for $100</a>.

              <p><em>The Outfoxies</em> arrives on consoles 30 years later. Tencent invests in its own version of <em>Ready or Not</em>. And could we finally get a <em>Kingdom Three Crowns</em>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. All I can think about right now is how there’s a perfect <em>Simpsons</em> screenshot <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/backpagepod.bsky.social/post/3ma6eg5h26c2a">for every major game</a> released in 2025. And no one had to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danarndtwrites.bsky.social/post/3mabjnlygj22d">use AI to make them</a>.</p>    <p>Activision <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001351763375325384%7Ctwgr%5E50868c1df8a9b754e43f660097df3e98a413ed04%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcall-of-duty-is-crossing-over-with-fallout-tv-show-in-season-1-reloaded%2F1100-6537059%2F">teased</a> the latest post-apocalyptic<em> Call of Duty</em> crossover with silhouettes of the Amazon show’s main characters, including Walton Goggins’ Ghoul and Aaron Moten’s Maximus in his Brotherhood Power Armor. The skins come just in time for the release of <em>Fallout</em> season 2 and an underwhelming launch for <em>Black Ops 7</em>. It’s not yet clear if players who want to run around Nuketown in Power Armor will be able to unlock it as part of the event pass or need to buy it separately.</p> <h2>Two years later, viral police-cam-footage game gets a big backer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bodycam-fps-police-shooting-unrecord-unreal-engine-1850358473"><em>Unrecord</em> blew up</a> thanks to a 2023 trailer that made the FPS look almost indistinguishable from a found-footage movie. The game that some were skeptical even really existed is now being funded by Tencent. Will it be the next <em>Ready or Not</em>?</p> <p>“In Tencent, we’ve found not just a world-class partner, but a team genuinely passionate about our game and vision,” Theo Hiribarne wrote (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/unrecord/bodycam-fps-game-tencent-backing"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>). “Despite its scale, Tencent has approached this partnership with humility, respect, and a real appreciation for our creative identity. It believed in <em>Unrecord</em> early and has supported us at every stage of our growth. We’re confident this collaboration will help us reach our full potential.”</p>

 <h2>A cult arcade classic comes to home consoles 30 years later</h2>  <p><em>The Outfoxies</em>, a Namco arena fighter for arcades that was directed by <em>Soul Calibur</em> producer Masuya Ohishi<em>,&nbsp;</em>is finally playable on modern machines. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-cult-namco-arcade-game-which-may-have-inspired-smash-bros-has-been-given-its-first-ever-home-release/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that the game was potentially one of the inspirations behind Nintendo’s own platform fighter <em>Smash Bros</em>. The new Arcade Classics version from Hamster Corporation is single-player on Switch 1 and PS4 but has split-screen and additional modes on Switch 2 and PS5.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo wins a 15-year-old lawsuit over the Wii Remote</h2> <p>It sued BigBen Interactive, now owned by Nacon, for infringing on its Wii Remote technology with unlicensed third-party controllers. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/"><em>The Games Fray</em> reports</a> that Nintendo secured $8.2 million in damages in a recent ruling after years of BigBen successfully delaying proceedings. Nacon will still appeal the ruling, however, so this cold case will drag on a bit more.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em> might get a spiritual successor</h2> <p>Developer Stumpysquid has been resurrected by Raw Fury cofounder Gordon Van Dyke, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/raw-fury-co-founder-resurrects-kingdom-two-crowns-developer-stumpysquid-seeks-partners-and-investors-for-new-game"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em> reports</a>. It’s looking for investors and probably developers to make a “micro-strategy survival game” which “builds on the same design fundamentals that shaped <em>Kingdom Two Crowns</em>, while exploring new mechanics, themes, and systems to deliver a distinct and contemporary experience.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-two-crowns-doesn-t-feel-like-a-sequel-but-it-s-1831052985"><em>Kingdom</em> games’ 2D pixel-art take</a> on tower defense was great and I’d love to see a new one draft off the current explosion in <a href="https://kotaku.com/thronefall-islanders-tower-defense-strategy-steam-pc-1850701534">great minimalist strategy games</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-many-dudes-crashlands-butterscotch-shenanigans-interview-2000652567">The <em>Crashlands</em> devs are back with something new and it looks really neat</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">Video game consoles are crashing out to 1995 levels.

<p>Former Larian employees have responded to the CEO’s recent comments about AI, with one saying, “Show your employees some respect.” </p>



<p>Larian has been a hot topic in the news lately and not always for the best reasons. Last week, we saw Larian reveal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Divinity</a>, which brought some hype into the fan base. However, a few days ago, the Larian boss’s comments on AI caught fire on social media, and now former employees are responding. </p>

<p>For a few days, Larian has been taking flak for using AI. Swen Vincke, the founder, stated, “I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it.” Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/show-your-employees-some-respect-former-baldurs-gate-3-and-divinity-devs-claim-larian-heads-are-lying-about-people-being-okay-with-using-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, a former employee has responded to the comment, stating that Larian is lying about everyone in the company being okay with it. </p>



<p>Anne Méthot, a former QA tester at Larian on <a href="https://x.com/GangstHannah/status/2000958281917866440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), has stated that, after working at Larian, they aren’t surprised by the new AI stuff, alleging that Swen Vincke is “lying about people being okay with it”. Another former employee, Selena Tobin, has also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they “loved working at Larian studios until AI”. Tobin asked the developers to show their employees some respect, as they are world-class and “do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.” </p>



<p>Swen Vincke has already posted on X to say they aren’t “pushing hard” to replace concept artists with AI. A new post on <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> also states that their “successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make. In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.” Larian will hold an Ask Me Anything after the holiday break to provide more insight. </p>
