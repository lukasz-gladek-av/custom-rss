As one of the first tasks of your adventure, you’ll need to make your way over to Patty’s Party Planning Place to recruit three companions. Whether you choose to take along the premade characters or create your own allies, you’ll see that each character can assume one of eight classes. With no frame of reference for how each class performs, how on earth are you supposed to choose?</p><p>Fortunately, you should know that your choices here aren’t necessarily permanent. <strong><em>Dragon Quest III</em> will eventually let you change each of your companions’ classes later on in your adventure, so your goal here is to pick the classes that will help you early on the most</strong>. In some cases, this may mean taking classes that start strong out the gate. In other cases, you may want to prioritize classes that learn valuable utility skills that the character’s second class can inherit down the line. Either way, you have some flexibility with your picks here.</p><p>To help you decide which classes will serve you best in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, we’ve assembled a tier list that ranks their early game benefits from best to worst. Note that <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> does feature new mechanics and class changes that change how jobs perform relative to previous versions of the game, so longtime fans can’t necessarily rely on their preexisting knowledge of the game. Also, <strong>please note that this is strictly a tier list of which classes to start with, not each class’s overall performance throughout the game</strong>. Some picks function much better when used as mid-game class changes, and one of the best classes in the game isn’t even available at the start!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-recommend-id="image://bb5611116313570c9f74bd03440271eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It can inflict decent physical damage, especially since it can equip strong whips that damage entire groups of enemies. Additionally, Monster Tamer learns healing abilities in the form of <strong>Emergency Groom</strong> and <strong>Soothing Song</strong>, which offer single-target and party-wide healing respectively. Not only is this the only source of party-wide healing in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>, these also work in instances where magic is blocked since they are classified as Abilities. Monster Wrangler doesn’t scale as a healer into the later game, but it fills a powerful niche early on.</p><p>That said, <strong>it’s the new collectible monsters that elevates Monster Wrangler from good to great.</strong> As you explore the world, you’ll find friendly monsters that you can typically recruit by either using the correct item or skill to get them to talk to you. Not only do Monster Wranglers let you automatically catch monsters without fulfilling these prerequisites, collecting a large roster will grant Monster Wranglers new skills as well. This critically includes <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, a powerful attack that scales with the total number of monsters you’ve collected. As long as you explore and use the Monster Wrangler’s <strong>Animal Instinct</strong> Ability to track down recruitable monsters, you can easily learn this skill by the time you can change class.</p><p>If you plan to speedrun the game and don’t want to track down monsters, then Monster Wrangler admittedly won’t impress as much. Otherwise, this class covers so many early-game niches and learns such strong Abilities that it will find use in any party you stick it in.</p><h3 id="h33090"><a id=""></a><strong>Mage</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-recommend-id="image://efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Mage character class, which is seen wearing a green robe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-recommend-id="image://efa6256e3359251a0234039102710656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. A menu displays the Mage character class, which is seen wearing a green robe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Mages have always been good in <em>Dragon Quest III</em> thanks to their access to powerful magic attacks. However, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> gives all magic users an inadvertent buff, since all level-ups will fully restore that character’s HP and MP. This means Mages can use their most powerful magic with only the slightest restraint in dungeons, since they’ll usually receive full restoration before their MP runs dry. In other words, Mage is easily a top DPS pick and one of the best damage dealers to start out with in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></p><p>Even without this boon, Mage would still be a good starting class. It excels at damaging groups of enemies, which you’ll be dealing with way more than single targets. It’s also a great candidate to turn into the mighty Sage class thanks to its naturally high Wisdom and MP stats (see the Gadabout description later on). Mages aren’t quite as useful if you change them to any class that isn’t a magic user, but overall this is an obvious class to pick.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-recommend-id="image://45ee390148f929f56bf7ab1878ffb3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Priest character class, which is seen wearing yellow boots and gloves and a blue cloak and hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While not essential, these classes are top picks to round out your party.</p><h3 id="h33091"><a id=""></a><strong>Priest</strong></h3><p>Funny enough, you don’t <em>need</em> a dedicated healer when you start out in <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. You can technically cover your healing bases by using your main character and either healing items or the Monster Tamer until you eventually get a Sage in your party. Regardless, if you’re wondering who your third party member should be, I’d suggest “have a little Priest.”</p><p>Starting with a Priest has two huge perks. First, a dedicated healer frees up the rest of your party from healing duty, including your incredibly powerful protagonist. Second, a Priest learns so many helpful support skills in the early game that it’ll make virtually any class it later changes to better. Even a Fighter can function like a <em>Final Fantasy</em>-style Paladin when it can remove a slew of status resistances and provide some backup healing when the chips are down.</p><p>Oh, and Priests can learn some basic attack magic in the form of <strong>Woosh</strong> and <strong>Swoosh</strong>, which it can easily use thanks to the aforementioned full heals on leveling up.</p><p>Do keep in mind that if you insist on using both a Mage and a Priest, you may struggle in instances where magic is sealed or you need to use physical attacks. Still, if you’d like to prioritize survival, definitely pick a Priest starting out.</p><h3 id="h33092"><a id=""></a><strong>Martial Artist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-recommend-id="image://a381683b5db76a7044ee989a5dc60c3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Martial Artist character class, which is seen wearing a green Gi." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Martial Artist’s weaknesses are actually strengths when it comes to the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. On one hand, they’re extremely picky with equipment, and they’re literally better off fighting bare-handed in the early game until you can find claws for them to use. On the other hand, this means you don’t need to invest a lot of gold into dressing them and you can focus on the rest of your party without grinding. Additionally, the Martial Artist only learns situationally useful skills in the early game. But despite that, skills like <strong>Flying Knee</strong> and <strong>Hawkeye Claw</strong> will come quite in handy, especially in the dungeons you’ll need to clear before you can unlock class changing.</p><p>There’s honestly not a lot to say about the Martial Artist, as its main function is to just <em>punch</em> nine times out of ten. Still, if you want a dedicated physical attacker on your team, the Martial Artist is a good starting point.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-recommend-id="image://9e79133572fc009f3d33177e5b57ed51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Martial Artist character class, which is seen carrying an axe and wearing a red suit of armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While these classes may not be the most impressive picks in your starting party, you may prefer them above the higher-tier picks depending on your play style.</p><h3 id="h33093"><a id=""></a><strong>Warrior</strong></h3><p>As the bread and butter pick for a physical attacker, the Warrior is in a slightly weird boat. It can equip a richer variety of weapons and armor compared to the Martial Artist, but that can put more of a strain on your gold reserves unless you want to forgo loading out your other party members. Its early game skills also aren’t especially impressive, as it takes quite a few levels for it to learn strong physical attacks. The Warrior does technically fulfill a tank role for your party, but frankly the Hero already does an admiral job of filling this void throughout the early game.</p><p>Should you eventually switch one of your classes into a Warrior later on? Sure, it’s a good class! Additionally, if you’re the type of player who always likes to level grind until you get all the best equipment before heading into a dungeon, then the Warrior will likely come out ahead of the Martial Artist. Otherwise, you may want to consider one of the higher-tier options above before picking a Warrior.</p><p>DQ3-Class-Thief.jpg]</p><p>Caption: A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. A menu displays the Thief character class, which is seen wearing long white shorts and a yellow shirt.</p><h3 id="h33094"><a id=""></a><strong>Thief</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="176214bf385e592abcdc99aed2add9bb" data-recommend-id="image://176214bf385e592abcdc99aed2add9bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

A menu displays the Thief character class, which is seen wearing long white shorts and a yellow shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I want to make one point abundantly clear: <strong>Thief is one of the most important classes in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em></strong>. Its skills <strong>Nose for Treasure</strong> and <strong>Scoop</strong> are <em>invaluable</em> for finding hidden treasure, including the collectible Mini Medals scattered all throughout the game. <em>Several</em> hidden items have literally no visual clue for where they are unless you’re standing on top of them, so the Thief’s skills are essential for completionists. Additionally, <strong>Padfoot</strong> lowers the rate of random battles, which makes several dungeons in the game much more palatable.</p><p>So why not pick a Thief right off the bat? Long story short, it takes them a few levels to get these essential skills, and they are much stronger in battle if you let them inherit skills from another class. If you don’t mind using a weaker class in the early game of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> and just want those key skills right away, then you should definitely start with a Thief. But for the smoothest play experience, just make Thief one of your first class changes instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-recommend-id="image://a4f310c69b8158f253d5544de5ec5891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

It <em>is</em> usable, as it can inflict respectable damage and equip some strong weapons. The Merchant also can find extra gold after battles, which can be helpful early on while money is relatively scarce. You can even use the “Show” command with a Merchant in the party, which gives you a full and fun description of every item in the game. It’s a really neat touch!</p><p>The Merchant’s problem is that it offers almost no long-term benefits to your party. Sure, the Show command can let you know if an item is cursed, but that’s usually specified in an item’s description already. The skill <strong>Service Call</strong> technically lets you use Inns on-demand, but it doesn’t work in the dungeons where you’d need it the most. It does learn the powerful attack <strong>Call to Arms</strong>, but this is a later-game move and is functionally identical to the Monster Tamer’s <strong>Monster Pile-On</strong>, which is overall cheaper to use.</p><p>Merchants aren’t bad, and they are fun to use. But of all the classes in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em>, this is the easiest to skip.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-recommend-id="image://ca02f664667e4aabadde07cfdeea5b1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake.

Don’t bother with this until later.</p><h3 id="h33096"><a id=""></a><strong>Gadabout</strong></h3><p>Please don’t start with this literal clown emoji of a class. It’s bad enough that Gadabouts learn nothing useful in the early game and contribute less damage than the classes listed above. What’s worse is that Gadabouts will literally waste turns disobeying your commands to instead pull pranks on the battlefield, all of which can stun or weaken your party members. Yes, you read that right: You will encounter instances in which having a Gadabout in your party is actually worse than not having a third party member at all.</p><p>Why does such an awful class exist in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> to begin with? Well, if you can pull off leveling a Gadabout high enough, it can learn some useful (albeit often niche) abilities that no other classes can. Additionally, the Gadabout is the only class that can change into the Sage class without consuming the rare Words of Wisdom item. In either case, <strong>the goal with the Gadabout is to have it in your party for the least amount of time possible</strong>. Since EXP scales up sharply as you progress in your adventure, you won’t have to endure using a Gadabout for nearly as long if you save this for a class change later on.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thunderful has announced its second restructuring in less than a year’s time. This time, it could see up to 100 people lose their jobs within the company.</p>



<p>The announcement came on Thursday via the <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website</a>.</p>



<p>“This newly announced program follows the cost-saving measures introduced earlier this year, as well as the divestment of the Group’s distribution business to manage previously incurred net debt,” Thunderful said. “Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow.”</p>



<p>This restructuring will see the company move focus to external publishing with third-party games. Thunderful says it will “reduce the Group´s fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility, enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity.”</p>



<p>“It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience,” Thunderful CEO Martin Walfisz said.</p>



<p>As part of the moves, somewhere between 80-100 people in and outside of Sweden will lose their jobs. Those in management and administration will also be impacted by the layoffs.</p>



<p>Thunderful expects to have one-time costs of $22.8M – $27.4M as part of separation costs after negotiating with unions. In total, however, they anticipate the job  cuts to improve the overall cash flow by $73M – $82.2M.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost due to layoffs across more than 160 companies.</p>



<p>What do you think of the restructuring and layoffs at Thunderful? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-release-date-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Trading has been part of the Pokémon fabric and DNA since day one. It’s no surprise Trading is a huge topic of discussion in Pocket, and I’ve gathered the latest news and announcements to tell you everything we know about Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Trading mechanic.</p>



<p>Once you’ve opened many Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packs</a> and reeled off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Picks</a>, your collection should look very full; but you’re also bound to have tons of duplicates. Getting extras of the same card is crucial when it comes to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-flair-in-pokemon-pocket-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flair</a> in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but it can become an annoyance too. There are so many Pokémon I love when I first pull but become irritated by when I see them for the 10th time—or twice in one pack!</p>



<p>You can swap duplicates in real life—one area where the physical edition of the Pokémon TCG differs from the virtual format. We know Trading is in Pokémon TCG Pocket, but questions are being asked about it daily, and I’ll answer them now.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Can you Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let me Trade, please! Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You cannot Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket at present</strong> as the feature is currently locked behind a notice saying “<strong>Coming soon.</strong>” I think this part of the equation is quite self-explanatory. You can’t Trade, but The Pokémon Company has addressed the future of the mechanic.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-trading-coming-to-pokemon-tcg-pocket">When is Trading Coming to Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>As announced by the <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP_JP/status/1856864629009363249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket X social media page</a>, “<strong>January 2025</strong>” is the official start period for Trading.</p>



<p>The post has been <a href="https://x.com/PokemonDealsTCG/status/1856820750529040857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated</a>, and says, “We are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be Traded started in January 2025. We are gradually planning to expand the selection of cards that are able to be Traded.”</p>



<p>So, <strong>not all cards can be Traded on day one</strong>. Using my best judgment, I’d say all cards ranging between <strong>one and three diamonds</strong> are going to be eligible to Trade. It does mean EX cards and other mega-rare pulls—such as Full Arts—need to wait a bit longer. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, like many players, I find myself in the situation where I have completed most of the main Genetic Apex set, and I’m mainly missing the odd EX card, as well as Full Arts. The Pokémon Company likely doesn’t want so many people having every card already, and it encourages players to spend more money and open more packs in a bid to pull the rarest cards.</p>



<p>Also, don’t be surprised if <strong>Gold Crown cards are never made Tradeable in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</strong> We’ll update this as we learn more about the card criteria for Trading.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-trade-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Trade in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The actual Trading process hasn’t been outlined yet, but we wager a similar system to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon GO</a> is likely to be employed: Direct, one-to-one Trading between connected players, and you need to have a certain amount of currency to do so.</p>



<p>Pokémon GO requires Stardust to Trade—with certain cards made untradable altogether—and I expect you probably need a certain amount of Shinedust to Trade in Pokémon Pocket. The amount likely depends on the rarity of the creature, and Trading may be limited to a certain amount per day. This is all conjecture for now, but I can’t imagine the system will drastically deviate from this theory.</p>

<p>When Obsidian announced Avowed’s delay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out of November 2024</a> to February 2025, the reason given was that it gave the game time to breath on its own against what would’ve been fierce competition. While some fans didn’t believe that to be the case, Xbox head Phil Spencer once again claimed that the decision wasn’t because of the game’s quality.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> (subscription needed), Spencer said that the company had so many games releasing that it just made sense to move Avowed. </p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>“We can afford it when we have the Diablo expansion, then Black Ops, then Indy [and the Great Circle],” he said. “We didn’t move it because Obsidian needed the time. They’ll use the time.”</p>



<p>With the game now set to launch on February 18, Avowed will still face competition from games outside of the Microsoft umbrella such as Civilization 7, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and more. Despite those other game’s releasing, it seems as though Avowed won’t see another delay based on Spencer’s comments.</p>



<p>Spencer added that discussions with Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty and the Game Pass team helped them spread out the releases of their games to where they see a fit.</p>



<p>When it launches, Avowed will be available exclusively on Xbox Series X|S and PC. The game will also be a day one release on Game Pass.</p>

            <p>
The Rogue Prince of Persia will receive an enormous new update, Second Act, next week on 21st November, that looks like it'll function as something of a full relaunch. 
</p>
<p>
This roguelite take on Ubisoft's historical action series from some of the developers behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> arrived in early access back in May this year to a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
Now, developer Evil Empire is adding the game's biggest update yet, which will revamp the game's visuals and double the game's size. You can take a look at the changes in the new Second Act trailer below:
</p>

<p>
Writing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4508758658863071521">Steam</a>, Evil Empire describe the update as a "glow-up" for the game, with additional detail and tweaked colour palettes. Most notably, the Prince is no longer purple
</p>
<p>
"This change was made as the purple tone just didn't fit with the new direction," Evil Empire wrote. "We find that the art direction is now a much better fit with the game's genre, setting/story and the Prince of Persia series as a whole." Which is fair, as the Prince is not purple anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
Other content added in the Second Act update includes more biomes, bosses, a fresh story act and additional quality of life improvements such as multiple save slots.
</p>
<p>
"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."

<p>MADFINGER Games has just revealed an exclusive new trailer showcasing the long-awaited Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare. This monumental and major overhaul introduces a day-night cycle to the open-world tactical shooter, forever altering the course of combat and further proving that in Gray Zone Warfare, <strong>every move matters</strong>.</p>



<p>In the snapshot trailer, we get a glimpse at how the world of Lamang changes under a veil of darkness. From new equipment to combat the shadows to quests that can only be completed at night, Gray Zone Warfare players are preparing to eat well when the Night Ops update is released on November 27.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024 to a very positive reception, despite there being some teething issues.</p>



<p>MADFINGER has been a stalwart force in tackling these issues, working hard to deliver a game that continuously improves and innovates, with community-led feedback sitting at the heart of everything the team does.</p>



<p>The Night Ops update has been on the cards for a couple of months, and following the release of a new teaser trailer, it has been revealed when that update will hit the ecosystem.</p>



<p>If you’re a Gray Zone Warfare fan eager to jump into some night-based activity, you won’t need to wait long. The Night Ops update will be released in Gray Zone Warfare on  November 27, which is also when MADFINGER will publish a full, feature-length trailer showcasing the impending changes.</p>



<p>I played Gray Zone Warfare as soon as hit early access this year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/">was blown away</a> by the depth of the game and the ambition of MADFINGER. I was then welcomed by the team at Gamescom to learn about these changes and to talk at length <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Marek Rabas</a>, the CEO of MADFINGER, about the future of extraction shooters.</p>



<p>If you’ve been enjoying Gray Zone Warfare, believe me when I say you’re not ready for Night Ops – it’s going to bring about a paradigm shift that’ll forever change how you play the game, but it’s <strong>all good things</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Night Ops? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A month after version 1.0 was released on PC and console, Undisputed has received its first post-launch update for all players. The update addresses a few key concerns from the community while developer Steel City Interactive continues to work on it’s planned December update. </p>



<p>Some of the key fixes in Update 1.1.3 include adjustments to Deontay Wilder’s stats for more fair online play, removeable of the critical stumble reaction, updated blocking, and more. You can check out the full patch notes from the update for yourself.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-details">Undisputed Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Changes to the block colliders to ensure that block functions as expected and the number of power punches that break through the block is greatly reduced.</li>



<li>Deontay Wilder’s stats have been reduced, and we’ve removed a trait. His power hooks should now be less impactful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased max stamina cost of hooks and straights.</li>



<li>Increased the cost of power punches to both short-term and max stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Introduced a threshold on the number of power punches that can be thrown within a single fight before the stamina cost per power punch is increased further.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased the stamina cost of pushing, which should reduce the amount of people spamming the push mechanic.</li>



<li>Temporarily removed the critical stumble reaction from the game as it was too punishing.</li>



<li>Reduced the effectiveness and chainability of hooks by further slowing them down when a fighter is gassed.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent players from moving if they entered flat-footed movement while fighting on the inside.</li>



<li>On Xbox and PC Steam: Ranked quitters should now receive a loss on their record, and the remaining player should receive a win. The fix for PlayStation is taking longer than we’d like and will hopefully be part of the December update.&nbsp;</li>

None of the unused franchises were cut either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what's more, Astro Bot similarly featured franchises such as Stellar Blade in its credits before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-confirms-astro-bot-post-launch-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-release-schedule">its protagonist Eve was added as a bot in the speedrunning DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot still includes licensing credits for Rayman, Worms, Assassin's Creed, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, Croc, and Tomba, the last of which was added today. Nothing official has been said about if these games will be featured eventually, or if more DLC is planned. The PS5 exclusive seems to have performed well both commercially and critically though, so Sony may want to push more DLC down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first two months</a> on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 in IGN's review</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst.1036011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is currently in the thralls of a paradox. For players, it could be argued we’re in one of the greatest times for gaming – there’s incredible breadth of choice across consoles, handhelds and PCs made ever-more accessible through gaming subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. But from an industry perspective, things could not be more dire. More and more studios seem to be closing, original IPs are being scrapped mid-development, and vast legions of game developers, programmers, artists, and animators have been cut loose. To put it simply: the AAA video game bubble has finally burst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the past two years, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 23,000 jobs in the video game industry were lost</a>, with a staggering 6,000 in January 2024 alone. Over 30 video game development studios have ceased operations including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Arkane Austin</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group">Volition</a>, and most recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios</a>. What’s worse, this trend only shows signs of continuing rather than diminishing. How did we get here? Some analysts have concluded these closures and redundancies are a necessary remedy to companies having overextended themselves in response to inflated demand in the market during the COVID-19 pandemic. While that’s undeniably a factor, I believe the truth lies in other long-gestating issues within the AAA project bubble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just five years ago, AAA projects’ average budget ranged $50 - $150 million. Today, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/465096/article/cma-discovers-video-game-budgets-are-ballooning-to-as-much-as-1-billion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum average is $200 million</a>. Call of Duty’s new benchmark is $300 million, with Activision admitting in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/644939aa529eda000c3b0525/Microsoft_Activision_Final_Report_.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Competition &amp; Market Authority’s report</a> on AAA development that it now takes the efforts of one-and-a-half studios just to complete the annual Call of Duty title. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s far from just Call of Duty facing ballooning costs. In the same CMA report, an anonymous publisher admits that development costs for one of its franchises reached $660 million. With $550 million of marketing costs on top, that is a $1.2 billion game. To put that into perspective, Minecraft – the world’s best-selling video game of all time – has of last year only achieved $3 billion. It took 12 years to reach that figure, having launched in 2011.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The realities of these budgets mean entire publishing houses are massively overstretched and are now desperately facing the consequences: if their developers’ huge projects don’t make money immediately, they must die. Sega’s sci-fi shooter ‘super game’ Hyenas was in development at Creative Assembly for seven years, and – just as it was publicly playable for the first time via alpha testing – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-cancels-creative-assemblys-hyenas">it was cancelled</a>. The reason? Sega preemptively concluded Hyenas couldn’t make its money back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s survival project Odyssey had a similar trajectory. Odyssey would’ve been the studio’s first new IP in eight years and, given the market’s love for games like Minecraft and Rust, such a gaming titan should’ve undoubtedly made waves with this project. When Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, the project was swiftly killed with little reason publicly given beyond inconveniences in switching engines to increase player count on the servers. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The current AAA publishing cull reflects a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These examples of the current AAA publishing cull reflect a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original, with publishers perhaps more risk-averse than ever to stray out of their established IP safety bars. But even <em>well-known</em> IP that could be worth millions in sales and revenue is being left to rot. Despite owning Infamous, Jak &amp; Daxter, Killzone, Resistance and Sly Cooper to name a few entries in PlayStations’s sprawling dormant library, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki recently claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-doesnt-have-enough-original-franchises-built-from-the-ground-up-executive-says">the company lacks enough original IP to consolidate itself as a true gaming powerhouse</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Totoki may mean is that Sony’s older catalogue of library IP does not fit the mould of what every publisher has been mindlessly chasing for the better part of the decade – the next big live-service money printer. It’s difficult to imagine much fanfare for a Sly Cooper reboot where Bentley and Murray are purchase-to-play, grand heists are season pass bonuses and worlds are delivered half-baked instead of fully formed. It’s undeniable that on some level, the video game market <em>has</em> changed forever because of the live-service model. New video games don’t just have to compete with new rivals but somehow find space in an increasingly crowded market dominated by decade-old titles like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto: Online –  games which will continue to hold higher player counts than many of the top-sold games of the last few years. But live-service titles require investment of not only money, but time to find their audience – neither of which was afforded to Firewalk Studios’ Concord.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/concordthumb-1723742937181.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The crew of Concord's Northstar will never fly again. Image credit: Sony / Firewalk Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent fate of Concord’s Firewalk Studios serves as a microcosm for the increasingly bleak outlook for the next few years in video game development. Concord was Firewalk’s first game, its baby in many ways. An eight-year development bolstered by a Sony acquisition (with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concords-initial-development-deal-was-200-million-but-it-wound-up-costing-sony-much-more-report">reported cash injection of $200 million plus</a>), PlayStation reportedly believed it had the next Star Wars-esque franchise on its hands. But the game struggled significantly across both its beta testing period and launch, and was soon completely shut down by Sony, with Firewalk closed for business shortly after. Concord’s downfall happened faster than any other failed game of the live-service era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a decade earlier, though, a similar disaster was plaguing Blizzard’s Diablo 3 – the crippling ‘Error 37’ message made the game unplayable and fans worldwide decried the absolute failure to launch. Soon after, the game’s real-money auction house left players with a foul taste in their mouth and Diablo 3’s reputation was roasting in the fires. But rather than abandoning it, Blizzard not only repaired the game and removed the Auction House, but fundamentally upgraded and evolved it to Diablo 3 2.0 with its Reaper of Souls expansion, finally cementing its comeback as a brilliant game. It’s a similar story we’ve seen with CD Projekt Red’s hard-fought battle to win Cyberpunk 2077 fans back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the alleged $200 million + budget had been lowered, the project direction refocused as a spark for a new universe rather than a Big Bang, it doesn’t seem hard to believe that Concord may have found its audience with some Blizzard or CDPR-like shepherding from Sony. Many projects akin to Concord could be the medium-size successes they deserve to be, if not for the financial corners these publishers have found themselves backed into.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If everything is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that such financial corners are anything publishers should always attempt to navigate. Gamers are beginning to wane interest in these monolithic projects. You need only look at a top rated games of 2024 list – whereas 2023 award lists were littered with AAA titles from 500-strong studios, 2024’s show a revitalised hunger for a smaller, more independent spirit. Arcade machine throwback UFO 50, the Metroidvania-esque Animal Well, poker roguelite Balatro, and text-based pixel-art adventure The Crimson Diamond are just some of the games you’ll see appearing again and again on these lists. Despite their numerous differences, they share a commonality – a smaller, more refined experience that recalls earlier eras of gaming where marriages of mechanics and storytelling were key through technological craftiness, rather than literal country-sized game worlds. The nostalgia they create for older video game generations are central to the heart of their creation: they just want you to pick them up and have a good time now and again. The slow but increasingly clear pivot of video game audiences to a potential indie game renaissance is a clear message to publishers that if <em>everything</em> is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to undercut the difficulty in getting those independent titles made. UFO 50’s Mossmouth LLC team consisted of six developers working over many years, while both Animal Well and The Crimson Diamond share similar stories of being crafted by solo developers - Billy Basso and Julia Minamata, respectively – over several years. Even a smash-hit like Lethal Company started life as one-man-band developer Zeekerss learning to develop games on Roblox before expanding his knowledge. All of these developers put <em>everything</em> they had over several years of their lives into creating these games – not in pursuit of money, but because of a <em>passion</em>. That’s why they don’t need humongous worlds or 300+ side-quests to tick off – these games all feel like lean enjoyment machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like the top-end of the video game industry is currently faced with two paths to choose from. The first is the status quo; it can continue to engorge on bigger budgets with impossibly-open-yet-incredibly-empty worlds filled with 80+ hours of content that has about 10 hours of meaning to its players, or hopelessly pursue the live-service train which left the station over 5 years ago, with late passengers wondering why the money isn’t rolling anymore. These billion-dollar gambles <em>could</em> pay off, but it’s becoming less and less likely. Or, they could opt for the second path and take a page out of Julia Minamata, Billy Basso and Zeekerss’ books – a wider breadth of projects, smaller in scope and scale with a refined focus on gameplay mechanics, and perhaps a return to older styles of video games long-dormant. Projects where developers aren’t afraid to take weirder choices and unexpected left-turns lest they crash their $400 million ship into a ‘mixed-to-decent’ initial reception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe studios can remember that we used to play video games because they were fun – not because of their bigger-than-last-year maps carpeted by denser, higher-resolution grass that you walk across to finish another piece of side content that pushes you one digit closer to 100% completion.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s early days yet to issue a verdict on how the addition of weapons and Omnimovement from Treyarch’s recently released first-person shooter affect the Warzone meta, but one thing is clear: the unskippable Winner’s Circle has spread across games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see Warzone’s take on the Winner’s Circle in the clip below, captured from Call of Duty streamer Symfuhny’s gameplay by CharlieIntel.

Future Class alumni had called on the Awards to plea for a ceasefire. Keighley and his cohosts did not acknowledge the conflict during the broadcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't seem to be the case. The lack of a 2024 Future Class may have to do with another lesser-known protest about the program that hasn't risen to the public eye: one pleading with the organization to do more for Future Class inductees and alumni.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a meeting with Geoff Keighley and Bouchac in December 2023, members reportedly gave a presentation on how they've felt underserved by an initiative meant to celebrate the "bright future" of the video game industry. The presentation discussed inadequate accommodations at the awards ceremony and a lack of opportunities for alumni after the spotlights faded away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources familiar with the online meeting (who requested anonymity to speak freely to protect their careers) said Keighley and Bouchac were receptive to feedback, and seemed interested in improving the program.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A copy of the presentation reviewed by Game Developer spelled out the specific complaints raised by inductees, and proposed a number of possible solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A large segment of the presentation addressed what seemed to be a negative experience for Future Class inductees and alumni attending the award ceremony in Los Angeles. Attendee ADA requests at last year's event allegedly weren't "honored," meaning some members with disabilities struggled to see the show. Alumni were apparently seated in segments of the Microsoft Theater where the view was blocked by camera rigs and equipment (those affected were reimbursed by The Game Awards for their tickets), and the only official networking event was a surprisingly informal "meetup" before the ceremony where Game Awards representatives only briefly attended, reportedly departing after photos were taken. The presentation alleges that Keighley did not make a personal appearance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members raised the fact that though the Future Class segment is sponsored by advertisers, there is no funding for them to travel to the event, leaving some honorees to watch at home. They also expressed disappointment over the lack of diversity among presenters onstage, such as the accessibility award not being revealed by a disabled presenter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Complaints were also raised about the lack of compensation for Future Class alumni who labor for the organization by mentoring new members, but weren't offered tickets to the awards themselves as part of their work. They're only offered a discount for purchasing their own tickets which according to ticketing site AXS, run anywhere from $50 to $500.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Presenters speaking to Keighley and Bouchac apparently expressed concern over the quality of support and resources offered to Future Class inductees after the the Game Awards spotlight fades. These resources include Unreal and Unity workshops, unpaid mentoring by previous Future Class nominees, and a slim amount of other opportunities. International inductees faced additional hurdles, as online events would sometimes be held in conflicting time zones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the presentation, Bouchac told Game Developer that the Future Class program regularly seeks feedback from inductees, and that while there is "always room to improve," a summer survey of participants showed the initiative and its benefits "improved" in 2024, with almost all saying the program was delivering on what it promised at the outset in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One-fifth of the 2023 class [ranked] the program as a 10/10 experience," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort">The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple Future Class inductees we spoke with praised the work the organization has done in the last year after the presentation. They explained the new resources and connections with industry veterans felt helpful—though there may still be some improvements to be made. "It did genuinely seem like they were trying to take the feedback into account," one 2023 cohort member explained, praising the survey described by Bouchac.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This individual's only complaint had to do with how The Game Awards has celebrated Future Class members this year on social media. A well-intentioned series of celebratory posts on X (formerly Twitter) were regularly mobbed by users spreading harassment. This followed the site's increasingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">lax approach to content moderation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">a growing right-wing backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to efforts at promoting diversity in games that exploded earlier in 2024. The Game Awards has since restricted replies on these posts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Future Class organizers apparently responded quickly to concerns raised by alumni over a lack of mentorship opportunities. Earlier in the year, they established a new networking program to support Future Class members and connect them with industry peers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some Future Class inductees have apparently greatly benefitted from this initiative, but others have reportedly had lackluster experiences, leaving them with just a few meetings with developers sometimes not skilled in mentoring junior developers. One source who participated in the mentorship process said they were frustrated by its limited structure, and that it wasn't as robust as those run by other professional organizations, like Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aiasfoundation.org/news/2024-2025_scholarships_open.asp">Scholarship program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also confirmed to Game Developer that The Game Awards is hosting a two-hour "connections mixer" before this year's ceremony with industry professionals and Future Class members from the 2023 cohort, but it's not branded as a Future Class-focused event. 2023 inductees have also been offered free tickets to this year's show and a compensated hotel room. These accommodations for members of last year's cohort appear to be a significant change from what was offered before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A 2023 class member told Game Developer they've appreciated the resources offered this year (praising "the free tickets, industry talks, and promotional opportunities") but offered a slightly cynical view of the program's mission. "I know this whole thing is just to launder The Game Awards' reputation so it doesn't look as disgustingly corporate as it is," they said. "But if they're taking advantage of me I at least like that I'm also taking advantage of them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the mentorship program and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">a Substack newsletter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maintained by Future Class alumni, there seems to have been little communication from The Game Awards about the future of Future Class. Bouchac's response to Game Developer implies the program is still active, but she didn't directly state if a new class of inductees would be introduced at this year's ceremony.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concerns expressed by Future Class alumni in 2023 and the ensuing slim communication raise uncomfortable questions about the program. Is The Game Awards offering enough support to the Future Class organizers in order to support the diverse group of rising developers inducted into the program?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it appears the answer will have to wait until 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
The Anti-Defamation League has accused Valve of "allowing the proliferation of hate", after publishing a report finding over 1.8m instances of extremist or hateful content - including Nazi imagery and support for foreign terrorist organisations - on Steam.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Defamation League - which describes itself as the "leading anti-hate organisation in the world" - shared its findings in a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">report published on its website</a>, after conducting an "unprecedented, platform-wide" analysis of Steam. This is said to have spanned over 458m user profiles, 152m profile and group avatar images, plus more than 610m comments on user profiles and groups, with the ADL's Centre on Extremism saying it ultimately identified 1.83m unique pieces of extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
Examples given include explicitly antisemitic symbols and copypasta, white supremacist copypasta, Nazi imagery - such as the swastika or Totenkopf - plus "tens of thousands of instances of users expressing support for foreign terrorist organisations like Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Hamas and others". The ADL also claimed to have found 184,622 keywords on Steam used in an extremist or hateful context - including "1488", "shekel", and "white power" - adding that 1.5m unique users and 73,824 groups had shared at least one example of potentially extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
The organisation went onto claim Steam has no public-facing content policies specifically linked to hate or extremism. However, a quick search reveals Valve's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">developer</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4337599680247610574/">community</a> guidelines do, in fact, explicitly prohibit hate speech, specifically "speech that promotes hatred, violence or discrimination against groups of people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation".
</p><p>
That, then, raises questions around Valve's enforcement of its policies, as the ADL highlighted elsewhere in its report: "The fact that extremist and hateful content is relatively easy to locate on Steam, raises questions regarding the efficacy of Steam's moderation efforts." It noted, for instance, that while Valve deploys filters and other forms of automated content moderation on user summaries and comments, these do not apply to all user-generated fields - and filters can manually be disabled. Additionally, the ADL called Steam's keyword detection "easy to evade", noting altered words and ASCII art can be used to circumvent Valve's moderation tools.
</p>
<p>
"While Steam appears to be technically capable of moderating extremist and hateful content on its platform," the ADL continued, "the spread of extremist content on the platform is due in part to Valve's highly permissive approach to content policy. In rare notable cases, Steam has selectively removed extremist content, largely based around extremist groups publicised in reporting or in response to governmental pressure. However, this has been largely ad hoc, with Valve failing to systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform."
</p>
<p>
"Valve needs to make significant changes to their approach to platform governance," the ADL concluded, "both in terms of policy and practice to address the ways in which hate and extremism have proliferated on the Steam platform." It finished by urging Valve to adopt policies prohibiting extremism and hate, to audit and "Red Team" content moderation practices to close loopholes, and to engage with civil society, academics, and researchers. More, including recommendations for policymakers, can be found in the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">full report</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Major gaming companies are selling their wares on a platform that is not addressing users' support of extremists and allowing the proliferation of hate," Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at ADL's Centre for Technology &amp; Society, added in an interview <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform?srnd=undefined">shared by Bloomberg</a>. This, he continued, "increases the likelihood that someone will travel all the way down the rabbit hole." Eurogamer has asked Valve for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hit PlayStation platformer Astro Bot looks set to add another game cameo to its ranks. 
</p>
<p>
Eagle-eyed Astro Bot fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gqsy21/a_new_thirdparty_character_credit_was_added_to/">reddit</a> have spotted a fresh tweak to the game's credits as of its latest patch, which now reference the inclusion of content from Tomba! Special Edition.
</p>
<p>
There's no sign of Tomba himself or the series' pig villains in Astro Bot yet, but its credits already point to the game getting further updates in the future with other extra characters.
</p>
<p>
This year's Tomba! Special Edition updated the 1997 classic PS1 platform adventure, originally published by PlayStation, for a fresh audience on PS5. It's been more than two decades since Tomba! 2 arrived to middling sales, but the franchise has continued to develop a cult following since.
</p><p>
Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">mentions in Astro Bot credits already mention a range of franchises yet to appear </a>, including Ubisoft series such as Assassin's Creed, Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>'s Worms and Croc: Legend of the Gobbos - which, like Tomba, also got a remaster this year.
</p>
<p>Still other characters have been glipmsed in concept art, but haven't yet appeared in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/comments/1gl7b6d/this_pleases_chop/">This pleases Chop...</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AssanCHOP/">u/AssanCHOP</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/">Astrobot</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Astro Bot received a warm reception from critics and fans alike when the dinky platformer dropped on PS5 back in September. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">more than 1.5m copies</a> have been sold.</p>
<p>
"Sony's glossy mascot gets an outing filled with imagination and loving craft," Chris Donlan wrote, awarding it top marks in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.

			<p>In 2021, seven developers from Gearbox, Bethesda, and Epic Games decided to team up and take a huge risk by creating a brand new game studio called Ruckus Games. Since they created the studio, it has been fairly quiet. Today,&nbsp; they've unveiled some sneak peeks into their upcoming debut title, and those who are interested are being given the opportunity to playtest the game and help the team. This title is being led by CEO and Game Director Paul Sage, who was the previous Creative Director of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-borderlands-3-post-launch-interview/">Borderlands 3</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>Already, Ruckus Games has quite a huge potential, as there are industry giants from Gearbox, Riot Games, Blizzard, and many more. Each founding member of Ruckus Games brings essential know-how to create a multiplayer game that is set to stand out from the crowd and draw in the audience.</p>
<p>When pitching to investors, Ruckus Games managed to sell their prototype to investors rather quickly, receiving $19 million in funding to help bring their multiplayer vision to life. The investors (who are not mentioned by name) were sold on the premiere project after playing just 20 minutes of a demo. Considering that when this happened, the studio was brand-new, and the prototype was made in 12 months, it's quite an impressive feat and is bound to leave people curious about what they could possibly have in store for those who may playtest the game.</p>
<p>At the moment, the title of Ruckus' project hasn't been announced. The title will be up to four-player co-op, with the world continuing to evolve and receive new content over time. The game takes place in a "reminiscent era amid the backdrop of the American heartland," where players are just ordinary people who are forced to try and become heroes when the town starts to get attacked. The game will feature a large roster of playable characters, with lots of weapon combinations that are wacky and fun to pull the audience in.</p>
<p>These weapon combos include a toaster that can shoot saw blades or a powerwasher-turned flamethrower. As you explore and unlock new items, you can cause as much havoc as you like, rescue NPCs, and go back to your Hometown, where you can customize, build, and upgrade your living area, which will then give you the option to upgrade your weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>"We want games where people have fun from the get-go. Games that are physical, joyous, and just a damn good time to be shared with others. We can't wait to show you what we have in store," says Game Director and Ruckus Games CEO Paul Sage.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in seeing what Ruckus Games has on offer, you are encouraged to sign-up to participate in the playtest on their <a href="https://www.ruckus-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-announces-this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-for-charity.1035960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC pack to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, and all proceeds from the sale of said DLC will go to charity.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>DLC spotlights Katia, a character from the original&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>and a seasoned war journalist. When a missile attack destroys her home, she's forced into a fight not only for her survival, but also for the survival of the book she's writing.</p>

<p>All proceeds from&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will go straight to 11 bit's four charity partners, namely <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">War Child</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.libertyukraine.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liberty Ukraine Foundation</a>, and Indie Games Poland, so the studio isn't taking a cent of your money for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=VHavI0fs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=Yd-W5OBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC will see all of its proceeds going to charity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will feature an entirely new story revolving around Katia, giving you the chance to revisit this cult survival classic through fresh new eyes.</p>

<p>Naturally, since this is another slice of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>, you can expect some very difficult decisions to crop up, as well as lots of opportunities to scavenge for resources and materials Katia will need to finish her book.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time 11 bit has donated all of the proceeds from all or part of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>to charity. When Russia first invaded Ukraine, the studio pledged all of the game's profits <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-profits-to-be-donated-to-ukrainian-red-cross-over-next-7-days" rel="nofollow">to the Ukrainian Red Cross for a week</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-is-being-taught-at-polish-schools" rel="nofollow">recommended by the Polish government</a> for teaching in schools, so it's not just gaming fans that are benefiting from&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>'s penetrating look at wartorn societies.</p>

<p>By the end of that month,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>sales had hit 441,000, which means it managed to sell almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">an extra 100,000 copies</a> in the week or so between then and its initial release. It looks like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2024-09-23/shares-of-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fears that the game underperformed</a> may well have been unfounded.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has reportedly stated that he's been working on his next game since 2020. According to reports, Druckmann revealed this during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion this week in which he appeared alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine.</p><p>A video of the event has been set to private, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">people on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) claim Druckmann stated that he's been working on this new game, whatever it might be, since 2020.</p><p>This would be little surprise, as Naughty Dog's last big brand-new game, The Last of Us: Part II, was released in 2020. It makes sense that Druckmann would begin working on his next project around then. As for what the game might be, that's anyone's guess, but there have been clues.</p><p>Following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, Naughty Dog confirmed that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">working on two single-player games.</a> One of these is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">expected to be The Last of Us: Part III</a> and the other is a mystery. In May this year, Druckmann said the new game he's working on is very exciting to him, and that's he feels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-teases-next-game-and-shares-his-belief-in-ai/1100-6523665/" data-ref-id="1100-6523665">"maybe the most excited" in his life</a> about whatever the game is. "I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said.</p><p>In addition to a potential new The Last of Us game, HBO is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-tees-off-in-spring-2025/1100-6527733/" data-ref-id="1100-6527733">bringing back The Last of Us TV series with its sophomore season in Spring 2025.</a> Druckmann is involved in the production of the show, in addition to his responsibilities in video game development.</p><p>Some are hoping that Naughty Dog might bring back the Uncharted series, but no one should get their hopes up about that. Naughty Dog has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-is-done-with-uncharted-and-might-not-make-last-of-us-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6510879/" data-ref-id="1100-6510879">"done" with the franchise</a> (though a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">different team could, of course, make its own Uncharted game</a>).</p>

With varying degrees of success, our tiny team chipped away at our game while trying to keep a community informed and happy over a long development cycle.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About Empires of the Undergrowth">About Empires of the Undergrowth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Slug Disco Studios was formed by three college friends in 2014 in order to make</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It took on its first new employee in early 2017, a community manager. It has since expanded to include a dedicated environment artist, two additional coders, and a larger marketing team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an RTS based in the world of ants, in which players excavate a subterranean nest to house their queen, raise her brood, and store food. This acts as the player's base. Overground, they collect resources, challenge enemy colonies, and deal with many threats from other creatures and the environment itself. It is set in a documentary style, with each real-life-inspired mission being narrated as if by voiceover for a TV documentary. Alongside this is a "mad scientist" sci-fi story where the player's persistent home colony of genetically modified ants battles against experiments thrown at it by an evil scientist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It began as a mobile game with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like underground mechanics and tug-of-war style overground gameplay. It's sometimes said (only semi-jokingly!) that the bitter disappointment of the now-defunct mobile version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the final kick up the arse needed to get the project started.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwz_rKC4uK0?si=5S1Z5-UQUgsaf6eL" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The trailer for the final species of ant added to the game with 1.0.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, it has evolved far beyond that initial premise. It has very much become its own thing—with a pheromone-based control system with individual toggles for resource collection, fighting, and more. While the bones of its original inspiration are still clear to see, nothing else works quite like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turned out to be as it found its footing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on December 1, 2017, and went to full release on June 7, 2024.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine">Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally envisaged as a mobile game. Smartphones were relatively new when the idea was first being kicked about, before the current microtransaction and ad-heavy revenue model had fully established itself. In our adorable naivety, we were certain that people wouldn't mind paying outright for a well-made, quick-and-easy game that was free of such things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was intended to be a tug-of-war where the player dug out and built tiles underground while an AI opponent did the same on the opposite side of an east-to-west map. Units would fight for areas of territory in waves, with only minimal control needed from the player.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luDMqoiLyiM?si=bxo2D5CVDi3hZDG0" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A very early protype of the game, running on our proprietary engine.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we wanted lots of units and shadowing, it seemed logical to us to begin work on our own engine that would strip away a lot of what we considered the bloat of premade engines, and concentrate on the features needed for good performance on the mobile devices at the time. This continued for well over a year, while we struggled to find an audience for this undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It eventually became quite clear to us that the only chance we had of actually getting anyone apart from ourselves interested in the game was to move it to a more sensible platform: PC. Although it was a wrench to turn our backs on so much work for mobile, in the end, it was a blessing. It allowed the game to flourish far beyond its initial limited controls, and the bones of an actual RTS started to form. By posting on various forums and social media platforms, we noticed the first tangible public interest in the project.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding the game's DNA">Finding the game's DNA</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaving the mobile concept behind brought up the possibility of a much more fully-featured game, and one single change by one of our devs brought this into stark contrast. Originally, the player would simply create jobs, and ants would come and do them autonomously. By adding a "call-to-arms," a single point placed on the map with a right-click that would bring all of the player's ants to that spot, the basis of what eventually became the control system was made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't take much of a leap of imagination from there to envisage the call-to-arms point as the end of a pheromone trail, which is what ants use to lay down and reinforce foraging paths in the real world. Over time, we realized that having multiple "pheromone markers" on a map and assigning ants to them would give the feeling of controlling a swarm spreading out in multiple directions—but it was missing something.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Colorful pheromone markers denote the end of a foraging trail. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't seem right to give the player outright control of individual ants since it was starting to feel like we were on the edge of something really rather special while still paying homage to our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired roots. We've all seen ant trails, traveling in sensibly routed lines, back and forth as they carry forage back to their nests. We found that by having the ants travel back and forth, with the pheromone marker acting like the end of a trail and the queen its beginning, suddenly, this haphazard, awkward system sprung to life and started to feel like an ant colony. You weren't commanding units who would respond instantly over radio; you were making pheromone-based alterations to their behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, we eventually found the game's USP to be a set of systems that make the player feel as if they are making "suggestions" to the living, breathing superorganism that is an ant colony, eschewing the traditional drag-box-and-right-click that most RTS games employ. Taking it a step further, if the responsiveness of the trails is tuned just right, the player can get a sense that they're taking the role of the 'hive mind' of the colony; the emergent gestalt entity that is the sum of many tiny decisions made by hundreds of individuals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter attempt #1—Just trust us bro!">Kickstarter attempt #1—Just trust us bro!</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was still being made in our proprietary engine. In hindsight, this was because of the sunk cost fallacy—we'd already thrown away a huge amount of research and optimization when we dropped the mobile idea, and clinging to the remains of the engine was definitely out of sentiment rather than logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In late 2015, we decided to attempt a Kickstarter campaign to get the word out, using footage recorded in this engine. While it was functional for most of what we wanted to do, it was not easy to work with and did not look particularly great.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOHhKKz1cNM?si=qZnl0yOlh0ug82UT" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A trailer to go along with the first Kickstarter attempt</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Kickstarter was not successful, reaching only £8,438 of its £15,000 goal. People liked the Attenborough-style voiceover and the clear documentary slant we were aiming for, but this wasn't enough to get most people to bite. While the simplistic graphics were likely part of the reason for this, there were two far larger ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first is overambition. Our first Kickstarter was replete with stretch goals, unrealistic expectations, and clearly getting far ahead of ourselves. These were not made out of deliberate exaggeration, but with that overambitious optimism that comes with being entirely new to something much more complex than you can really appreciate. Serious backers can spot this a mile off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second one was that we had no working prototype or demo. It's difficult to ask members of the public to trust in first-time game developers who can't at least show that their idea is sound in principle, has a fun game loop, and has the potential to end up being worth the early investment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unreal Engine—demonstrably better">Unreal Engine—demonstrably better</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we had gained some momentum online and the word had gotten out more (even with the failed Kickstarter), we knew that we should strike while the iron was hot and try again in as short an order as possible. If we were to do better the second time around, we would have to address both of the major points mentioned above.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we needed to get a working demo out reasonably quickly at this point. Reeling things in a bit, with heavy heart, we said goodbye to our in-house engine. We looked at several options, and in the end, there were only two choices that made sense to us: Unity and Unreal Engine 4. After extensive testing, Unreal Engine 4 was chosen due to its flexibility, great out-of-the-box graphics, and C++ implementation (the team was very familiar with C++, and the original engine was written in it).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>An early shot of the game in Unreal Engine 4, a huge upgrade from our own engine. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn't long before a demo was written, and even using the original assets from the custom engine, it looked much better right off the bat. A music track was written for the demo, which helped to add atmosphere and establish the tone of this subterranean world. Swallowing the instinctive pride that led us to try to make our own engine completely from scratch was a learning experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The earliest versions of this demo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http:// https://www.indiedb.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth/downloads">are still available for download on IndieDB</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo">Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a demo now collecting feedback and even getting some dedicated videos by content creators on YouTube, the time was right for a second Kickstarter. We reeled in our goal to £10,000 and set much more modest stretch goals—things that were definitely achievable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of offering lofty but unrealistic things such as whole separate campaigns, multiplayer modes, and fully-featured level editors, we instead had them offering single creatures to the game from a limited selection, which was also useful for us in whittling down the choices between the many millions of insect species we could have chosen from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of being more realistic about the ambition of the project and having a working demo that clearly showed the game loop, as well as a feel for its setting, meant that this time, the campaign not only succeeded but achieved 180% of its asking goal.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So you've got a community. What now?">So you've got a community. What now?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suddenly, we found ourselves with a lot of people eager for our game and quickly tried to organize that with a discussion forum. That worked to some extent, but with such a small team of three, it became clear that the owners would need to spend almost all of their time on the project doing development work, leaving little room for community management and other marketing tasks. While everyone was involved with everything (and still is to some extent), a dedicated community manager was the logical first hire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to bring on a community person towards the start of 2017 was the correct one, as the number one important thing with an Early Access title is to keep people well informed of what is going on. Updates to the demo helped a lot with that, but things like newsletters could become much more detailed, and having someone to quickly respond to technical support questions and create and reply to social media posts gave the community the confidence that their investment was not going to waste.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Access begins">Early Access begins</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of December 2017, roughly 18 months after the successful Kickstarter campaign, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on Steam. Other platforms followed later. At this point, the game's story mode had been divided into five "tiers", each representing a completed and polished package of content. Early Access launched with the first two of these five ready to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, large updates would be few and far between; the remaining major updates came out in April 2019, June 2022 and June 2024 respectively. There were many smaller but still significant updates inbetween, such as a freeplay or custom game mode, a battle arena for testing army compositions, and several extra levels that were apart from the campaign story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Quality over quantity">Quality over quantity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the very early feedback we got from paying members of the public was that the game was in good shape for an initial Early Access release, and this influenced our philosophy going forward. An older school of thought with Early Access was to release little and often, but we weren't so sure. With our small team size, making completed packages took at least a day for one of our devs (and often quite a bit more if there were errors to work through), which was costly. Making packages for all system demographics (Win x64, Win x86, Mac, Linux) was only really justifiable for larger updates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it was clear that some players were happy to report bugs (pun always intended) and provide detailed feedback, the majority of early adopters were expecting a polished product that grows over time. This meant that major releases would come slowly, but would also mean they would generally be better received than smaller iterative ones. Giant leaps, rather than small steps.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Optional betas: Players as testers">Optional betas: Players as testers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully, there are, of course, tools that allow experimental features and balances to be tested by people who were keen to do so, and optional beta tests became a valuable tool. We were lucky enough to get very detailed and well-thought-out feedback from a lot of people, and some of these became an integral part of our community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly before the second of our major tier releases in 2022 (the "Fire Ant Update") we gathered some of the best together into a focus group, which to this day provides initial feedback for releases, usually before they go out to anyone else. Hold on to your best community members and look after them.</span></p><p>Image via Slug Disco.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A long stretch—Keeping people happy">A long stretch—Keeping people happy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spent just over six and a half years in Early Access. This is far longer than we intended and, indeed, far longer than anyone expected. The early hiring of a community manager was crucial in ensuring this could happen. Their focus was often on reassuring people that things were happening (a common complaint for titles that update rarely or infrequently)—it is not fair to expect people to do more than a cursory search when asking if a game is dead. Several approaches were taken to conclude that search with a positive result:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty: first and foremost, people appreciate developers who understand their own limitations. For example, when asked why we didn't have release dates or ETAs for certain updates, the truthful answer of "We suck at guessing when we'll be done" was often the best approach</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Frequent engagement: although it is often advisable not to be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>too</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> active on discussion boards (and certainly not to get into arguments), showing a presence in answering queries and helping with technical issues is very beneficial. For those who want to talk more in-depth, Discord is ideal</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Formal news: progress newsletters were infrequently made before a dedicated community person was hired, but with them, concentrating on it, these could be regular and far more detailed. Later in the development cycle, a similarly regular vlog was also made as a visual counterpart to newsletters for those who dislike a lot of reading</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roadmaps: even when they change a lot, having an up-to-date roadmap goes a long way to reassuring a potential buyer of the immediate future. We updated ours every six months and continue to do so</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Positive response to feedback: the temptation is often to get defensive, but having someone who can be somewhat impartial to feedback, even harsh or seemingly unfair, and process it in a more digestible way for devs is valuable</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Extras: we developed semi-regular extra levels during particularly long stretches of the dev cycle. These almost always used existing assets and were more stripped down, taking only a few hours to develop as opposed to months for a full campaign mission</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Surprises: although we were usually open in the broad strokes of what was coming next, we occasionally dropped complete surprises on the community, which were always well received. For example, the arrival of the 'Adventure' extra level without an announced date and the fact that players could play as termites in the final tier</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final release">Final release</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game left Early Access and went to v1.0 in June 2024, with the final tier of the campaign story (the "Matabele Ant Update"). We had acquired a publishing partner, Hooded Horse, a little over a year before full release—we'd been self-published up until that point. They certainly helped us feel that the release was going to be suitably grand after such a long time.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELSOKmgDRvA?si=O05D3kj4BXH444ar" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The launch trailer, made by our friends at Hooded Horse.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of the time of writing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has sold in excess of 450,000 copies during its lifetime.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's hard to say what I would have done differently as what happened ultimately lead to the creation of a game I am extremely proud of", says developer John. "It is extremely hard to finish a game, sticking to it for that much of your life and stopping yourself from being pulled onto other exciting projects you keep thinking of. You lose the ability to tell if your game is even fun anymore."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"However I am not proud of its back-end structure and organization, we would never really have had an idea of what works in project organization and coding standards without making the mistakes in the first place. I would probably have spent more time making smaller projects and getting used to dealing with the code base, then restarted with the lessons learned for our full ant-based vision. That said, that is basically what we will be doing now—we just took the long way around to get there!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big, massive elephant in the room here, from a technical point of view, is multiplayer. "Without a doubt, I would plan for multiplayer early on," says Matt, the engine specialist on the team, when also asked about what he'd do if starting again. "I always envisaged multiplayer as being a part of it, and despite all the advice that was even about back then, we still kicked the can down the road expecting to get it running at some point."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a complete redo of the project, the groundwork for multiplayer would have been established very early on and the rest of the game would be built around that. In the end, the promised story mode had to take precedence and now it is highly unlikely that we can justify multiplayer for this project—but thankfully, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will not be our only project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you for reading the not-so-short history of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed wasn't delayed to 2025 because the game was in bad shape but due to the "avalanche" of games releasing in the final few months of 2024, according to Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, the Xbox head talked about the next role-playing game by Obsidian Entertainment and its delay, saying that it wasn't delayed because it was in bad shape and the developer needed more time to work on the game but because there was an avalanche of games scheduled to release in the final few months of the year. Postponing a game was something that Microsoft could afford since they had the Diablo IV expansion Vessel of Hatred, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Obsidian will also make sure of this extra time they got but did not need in any capacity.</p>
<p>It has been some time since we have seen Avowed in action. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/">A few months back</a>, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden talked about some of the less talked-about mechanics, such as the radial wheel that allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they want to do. The full gameplay demo from a few months back also provided another look at other gameplay mechanics and three different archetypes and at how Obsidian used the Pillars of Eternity world to present a slightly different RPG experience than what the franchise has presented to date.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th worldwide.</p>

<p>Our best Pokémon TCG Pocket Electric deck handpicks the best and strongest lightning-charged Mon out there. Electric-type Pokémon are some of the most visually impressive and striking, and I’ve put together the most complete Electric Deck to use against AI or real-life trainers.</p>



<p>The beauty of Pokémon is the veritable smorgasbord of cool-looking, devastating creatures. Pokémon has many different elemental types, tons of eye-catching moves, and strategies concerning weaknesses. This leads us nicely to Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Electric types and how they are utilized.</p>



<p>Electric Pokémon have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but the type has one of the strongest sets of cards in the collecting game. Thanks to special EX cards and easy starters, you can build a strong deck, and become the scourge of almost anyone in Pokémon Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-electric-deck-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Electric Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Focus your efforts on Pikachu packs. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best Electric Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket requires multiple <strong>Pikachu EX, Zapdos EX, Voltorb, Electrode, Pincurchin, Item, and Supporter Cards</strong>.</p>



<p>Our Electric Deck is honestly as good as anyone’s in the Pokémon Pocket scene. It’s hard to build, yes, and you need luck on your side when opening the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>. However, if you can assemble this well-constructed Electric deck, your chances of success drastically go up, and it can render PvP into an exercise in futility for your opponent.</p>



<p>Here’s the full deck and how to get it.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Card Name</th><th data-align="center">Card Type</th><th data-align="center">How To Get</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pikachu EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zapdos EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Zapdos EX</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Voltorb</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Voltorb</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Electrode</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Electrode</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Pikachu Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pincurchin</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Any Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pincurchin</td><td data-align="center">Pokémon</td><td data-align="center">Any Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Giovanni</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Mewtwo Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sabrina</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Charizard Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sabrina</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Charizard Genetic Apex Booster Pack</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Professor’s Research</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Professor’s Research</td><td data-align="center">Supporter</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Poké Ball</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Potion</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Potion</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">X Speed</td><td data-align="center">Trainer</td><td data-align="center">Shop Purchase</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>To start, you need two Pikachu EX and Zapdos EX cards—these are the foundation of this Electric deck. You need to focus your efforts on <strong>opening Pikachu packs</strong> as this is how you can get both cards, and we all know the lottery of opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket—so fingers crossed for you.</p>



<p>This deck requires Pokémon from Pikachu packs, so concentrate on this booster, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free packs</a>—get all the other cards too—and the deck is set.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-electric-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Electric type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The trio of <strong>Tynamo, Eelektrik, and Eelektross</strong> is a great evolution set to throw into the mix if you’re missing some cards for the best Electric Deck, and you can gamble on the regular <strong>Holographic Zapdos</strong> if you’re feeling lucky.</p>



<p>Getting the four EX cards is tough, so alternatives are needed as a backup. I like to mix things up with Tynamo and its evolutions because if the cards fall in your favor, Eelektross is a low-key monster. <strong>140 HP</strong> and its <strong>Thunder Fang attack doing 80 damage and a coin flip to paralyze</strong> are big-time attributes.</p>



<p>I’m not as fond of the normal Zapdos as it does “<strong>30 damage to one of your Benched Pokémon</strong>,” but it can be played from the get-go, and its one attack does <strong>100 damage</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-electric-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Electric Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>This Electric Deck is so powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket because the <strong>EX cards can be played straightaway if you draw them</strong>, their main attacks deal <strong>high amounts of damage</strong> and don’t require much energy, their <strong>HP is high</strong>, and the <strong>retreat cost for each card is only one</strong>.</p>



<p>At times, the other Pokémon in this Deck are there to look pretty. However, aside from the EX cards, Voltorb and Electrode are straightforward cards with low costs and solid damage output, and Pincurchin is an ace in the hole thanks to its “Thunder Shock” attack capable of paralyzing opponents.</p>



<p>The Trainer and Supporter cards are ubiquitous across best decks, so there’s not too much out of the ordinary there.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> over the summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that Atomfall is a “very open” game where how you act around other characters in the world actually matters.</p>



<p>“In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way,” Taylor-Hill wrote. “If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>



<p>The full game is expected to take anywhere from 20-30 hours to complete “depending on how you approach the game”.</p>
