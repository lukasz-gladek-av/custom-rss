<figure data-uuid="d9f185e3e0605"><a title="Capcom Arcade Stadium LRG Physical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9f185e3e0605/capcom-arcade-stadium-lrg-physical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/round-up-limited-run-games-10th-anniversary-special-every-switch-announcement-and-physical">10th anniversary special presentation</a>, Limited Run Games announced that it was teaming up with Capcom on a line of physical releases. One of the titles falling in this physical line-up was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">Capcom Arcade Stadium</a>, which had a vague '2026' release date attached. Well, with the new year finally upon us, we've got some more information on what the physical will have in store.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for the collection will go live on the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/switch-limited-run-300-capcom-arcade-stadium-vol-1">Limited Run website</a> on <strong>9th January 2026</strong> for <strong>$59.99</strong>, but all those who want to get their hands on a copy will have a big decision to make: which cover do you want to see on your shelf?</p>
<p>Limited Run Games is showcasing a whopping <em>five</em> different covers for this physical release. There's one with all of the standard collection key art, but the other four feature new pieces of artwork for individual games featured in the collection: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/ghouls_n_ghosts">Ghouls 'n Ghosts</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/captain_commando">Captain Commando</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/final_fight">Final Fight</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/strider">Strider</a>.</p>
<p>The actual boxed contents remain the same, obviously, and each cover will sell for the same price, but it's a pretty tough decision. Here's a closer look at each design, so you can see for yourself:</p>


<p>Pre-orders will be sticking around until 8th February at 11:59pm PT / 2:59am ET (9th Feb) / 7:59am GMT (9th Feb), with copies expected to ship between 1st July and 30th September.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Capcom Arcade Stadium when it first launched on the Switch eShop back in 2021, and while the emulation wasn't always up to scratch, we called it "well worth the price, warts and all" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/capcom_arcade_stadium">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has revealed more cast members for the upcoming <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, and there are more than a few legendary faces joining the series, including celebrated British actors like Jason Isaacs and Bill Paterson.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">by Amazon</a>, the show will include iconic <em>Tomb Raider </em>characters like Lara Croft's butler Winston, her uncle Atlas DeMornay (who you can meet as part of the so-called <em>Survivor Trilogy</em>), and Zip, who made his debut as part of the <em>Legend </em>sub-series.</p><p>DeMornay will be portrayed by Jason Isaacs, best known for roles like Lucius Malfoy in the <em>Harry Potter </em>movies and General Zhukov in <em>The Death of Stalin</em>. Winston, meanwhile, will be played by Bill Paterson, who you may know as <em>House of the Dragon</em>'s Lyman Beesbury or the father in <em>Fleabag</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>A plethora of famous faces will be joining Amazon's <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>They're joined by screen legend Sigourney Weaver, who will be portraying "mysterious, high-flying woman" Evelyn Wallis, ostensibly a new character created for the show. Since Weaver is playing her, though, you can expect her to be a major player, and I'd be shocked if she wasn't the main antagonist of the series.</p><p>Another British icon joining <em>Tomb Raider </em>is Celia Imrie, who will play the British Museum's "Head of Advancement" Francine. She, according to Amazon, is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne".</p><p>Sadly, we still don't have a release date for the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, but we do know it'll be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e3656d82-1a10-44f8-b35b-c2f90b2993db" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">headed up by <em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and that <em>Game of Thrones </em>star Sophie Turner <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8353268c-a5b7-45ad-b3ba-18b83eaad069" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will be portraying Lara Croft</a>. Production for the show will begin on January 19th.</p><p>It's been all go in the world of <em>Tomb Raider </em>recently; not only is the show moving ahead at full pelt, but two - yes, two - new <em>Tomb Raider </em>games were announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">this year's Game Awards</a>. One's a remake of the original <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the other is an all-new title.</p>
<p>We'll likely get more information about the <em>Tomb Raider </em>TV show, including a release date, later this year, and more details about the two aforementioned games will probably be forthcoming as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>Ah, hello, Prince Arthur. This is King Dutch. Long time no see. We thought today would be a good day for rolling. The katamari. The gunslinger suffering from tuberculosis. Where the first rolls the second follows. Roll, roll, roll.</p>
<p>That, essentially, is the ethos behind a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> mod which streamer Blurbs created late last year, and has since shown off in a video that's heavy on large masses of horses and pardners being rolled into rootin' tootin' chaos balls.</p>

<p>Arthur Morgan runs around and objects nearby suddenly stick to him, forming a growing mass of limbs and wagon wheels that rotates and floats as a big glitchy mass. While the mod doesn't stick stringently to the Katamari series' strictly enforced size rules which dictate that you must start by rolling little things your size and can only roll up buildings or giant kaiju once you're sufficiently girthy, it looks like great fun.</p><p>Great fun that'll totally wreck your playthrough, but as a lover of those videos in which someone's turned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iv">GTA 4</a>'s NPC car speeds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn04UwfKk9o">up to a million miles per hour</a>, that's something I can get behind. So, I reached out to Blurbs via Discord to ask whether there are any plans to release this mod publicly in future.</p>
<p>Sadly, it's very much looking like I'll never get my hands on it. One member of the server was quick to reply that, while I should certainly wait for the streamer themselves to answer, to their knowledge the mod getting a public release is "highly unlikely", citing Blurbs going about making his mods in a way that's focused on ensuring they work for him specifically as one of the reasons that's the case. Blurbs himself then responded, pointing to that answer and saying "basically this".</p>
<p>It makes sense. After all, making mods in a form you're happy to mess around with on your own hardware and pulling them together into a tight and polished enough package you're comfortable letting others give them a go are vastly two different propositions. Especially when it's a creation as chaotic and likely with potential to cause crashes or otherwise mess things up as this Katamari mod.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-upon-a-katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> has a whole wild west themed zone, so I guess I'll head back there and blast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK2PyG-UZhw">this video</a> on repeat.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-prime-charger-160w-3-port-kicks-off-the-new-year-at-a-record-low-cheaper-than-year-end-pricing-2000656791</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It can be such a pain to run out of battery, whether that’s on your phone, computer, or otherwise. If you find yourself in that predicament more often than is practical, you should have a portable charger to help make sure you’re juiced up whenever you need to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">The Anker Prime Charger, 160W is up for grabs at Amazon for a limited time at a discounted price of $105.99 compared to its original retail price of $150.</a> That’s a discount of $44.01, or about 29% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful yet compact portable charger</h2>
<p>This is a powerful and compact portable charger that lets you charge several electronic devices simultaneously. That makes it a great pick for cell phones, tablets, game consoles, and more. It provides up to 160W of power through each of its USB-C ports, so it can safely and rapidly fast-charge a USB-C laptop while charging two additional devices (phone and/or tablet) at the same time.</p>
<p>The USB-C ports are ideal for providing high-power charging to newer laptops, tablets and smartphones, while the USB-A ports are ideal for charging older phones, Bluetooth speakers and/or other smaller electronic devices. Additionally, the Anker Prime Charger has Power Delivery (PD) capability, enabling it to supply power to your electronic devices at the fastest possible rate, allowing you to charge your devices quicker and more efficiently.</p>



<p>Although the Anker Prime Charger has the potential to deliver a significant amount of power, it’s still super small. You can put it on a desktop surface, nightstand, or kitchen counter without taking up too much valuable real estate. It’s also super lightweight and easily storable in a backpack or travel case, making it ideal for use during business trips, vacations, or work-from-home/coworking days, when users would prefer a single charger to replace a tangled mess of individual chargers and cables.</p>
<p>Built-in safety features enable you to feel confident when connecting expensive electronic devices. The Anker Prime Charger constantly monitors temperature and power consumption to ensure that it protects against heat damage (overheating), excessive voltage, and/or electrical shock due to short circuit conditions. Although these protective mechanisms operate transparently, they offer considerable peace-of-mind benefits when you need to charge multiple high-value devices at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">This Anker Prime Charger is absolutely perfect for its size, capacity, and performance.</a> It eliminates clutter, enables fast-charging capabilities for newer devices, and is compatible with both home and travel-based environments. Bottom line? You should get one and keep it in your bag, car, or somewhere else that you use often in case of emergencies. You never know when you might get struck with a charging emergency.</p>

              <p>How many more copies does <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> need to sell before Square Enix greenlights a new grid-based strategy RPG? Almost three years later, physical versions of<em> Hi-Fi Rush</em> are finally up for pre-order. And how long will it take for Netflix to turn <em>Arc Raiders</em> into its next streaming hit?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Depending on what you’re into, January will probably feel like a slow month for big new game releases, at least compared to last year. But I’m getting lowkey hyped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-is-the-chillest-dark-souls-clone-1838481190"><em>Code Vein 2</em></a>, the follow-up to the messy 2019 action-RPG anime soulslike. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJLfjZd78hw">has a motorcycle</a>.</p>

 <h2>Even<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ original director can’t believe how well the remaster is selling</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I underestimated the sales figures by too much.😂😂😂</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/2008464271731257715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Square Enix revealed that<em> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> has sold over 1 million copies. That might be “below expectations” for the infamously disappointed Japanese publisher, but it was enough to take Yasumi Matsuno by surprise. It also prompted a fresh message to fans from the remaster’s director.</p>

 <p>“The entire development team is not only grateful to you, but, in order to spread the joy, create a better experience, and encourage more people to play, we are looking at updating the game in the future!” Kazutoyo Maehiro wrote, according to a translation <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/og-final-fantasy-tactics-director-admits-he-underestimated-how-popular-the-ivalice-chronicles-would-be-as-it-passes-1-million-copies-sold-with-the-remakes-lead-teasing-future-updates/">from <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. What does updating the game in the future entail, exactly? Could the missing War of the Lions content be officially restored? Could we get fresh end-game modes?</p>

 <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">told<em>&nbsp;Wired</em></a> last year. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

 <p>Let the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics 2</em> summoning circle commence.</p> <h2>You can finally pre-order a physical copy of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></h2> <p>The 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks, a studio that Microsoft closed in 2024 but which was later re-opened under Krafton, is finally getting a physical version that you can start pre-ordering <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/2008192175138299918">from Limited Run Games on January 23</a>. That includes a PS5 version. This is one game everyone should have in their collection, even if it could still be a year before it actually starts shipping.</p>

 <h2>We could end up getting an<em> Arc Raiders</em> TV show</h2> <p>Embark studio head Patrick Söderlund <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w">told <em>GamesBeat</em></a> that Hollywood is interested and so is he. “We [wouldn’t] mind doing that. It would be fun, but it needs to be done in the right way. I hope that we will do that. I think the IP fits quite well with something like that.” Nothing is set in stone yet, however, and Embark doesn’t “have anyone working on a TV or film adaptation yet.” Maybe we’ll see it on Netflix in time for <em>Arc Raiders 2</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Game of Thrones</em> star Sophie Turner was fine with her ending</h2> <p>She acknowledges that the rest of the cast was disappointed with their characters’ fates. “But I feel that I was very happy with the way Sansa ended her story in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and no one else was really happy with their ending,” Turner <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/sophie-turner-game-of-thrones-sequel-return">told <em>The Direct</em></a><em>.</em> “I feel like I got a good one, and so I don’t know if I could revisit it.” Would she come back to do more <em>Game of Thrones</em>? “Show me the money,” she joked. She might be <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">too busy with</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em> anyway.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy 9</em>‘s character artist says goodbye</h2> <p>Toshiyuki Itahana left Square Enix at the end of last year. “Last year marked a major milestone with the 25th anniversary of FINAL FANTASY IX, a truly significant event, and I was deeply grateful to see so many people celebrating FFIX,” he <a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">wrote</a> in a message to fans. He’ll continue to produce art as a freelance illustrator.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736">The Korean <em>Splinter Cell</em> revealed at last year’s Xbox summer showcase could be in trouble</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/guy-behind-viral-focus-m-gaming-meme-never-expected-it-to-spread-so-fast-2000656706">The guy behind the viral AAA <em>Mario</em> meme is as surprised as you are</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><em>Stranger Things</em> fans need to let go</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>Neurable and HyperX are teaming up to develop a gaming headset designed to help you play better. How will it do this? With an "industry-first neurotechnology-powered" headset that can potentially improve focus and accuracy in competitive games. It's also designed to use "non-invasive" neurotechnology, so you don't have to worry about getting a few cybernetic upgrades to be compatible with the device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426"></a><figcaption>HyperX and Neurable's headset concept</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630470,1300-4630471" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"></figure><p>Neurable and HyperX claim that testing with the in-development headset has resulted in faster reaction times of up to 38 milliseconds, improved accuracy by 3%, and a higher number of targets were hit during FPS training tasks when tested on esports players. The headset uses neural-sensing technology to track metrics like cognitive load and stress from a user's brainwaves.</p><p>The AI-powered earpad sensors monitor EEG signals from your head, but it's worth noting that this isn't a magic bullet that will instantly improve your performance. You'll need to use the data from your sessions and training exercises to improve your ability to focus better during games.</p><p>Don't expect the headset to be out anytime soon, as it's still in a very early stage of development.

            <p>Amazon has announced more cast members joining its live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Renowned actress, beloved Faithful and nervous farter from last year's Celebrity Traitors Celia Imrie has joined already announced Tomb Raider cast members Sophie Turner, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple.</p>
<p>Other newly announced cast members include Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson and August Wittgenstein, to name just four.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, who is playing who? Well, along with Turner as Lara Croft, the following cast are confirmed in canon roles from the Tomb Raider video games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is <strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend (many suspected this is who Bobb-Semple would be playing) </li>
<li>Jason Isaacs is <strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle</li>
<li>Bill Paterson is <strong>Winston</strong>, the long-standing Croft family butler</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following roles are new to the Tomb Raider universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is <strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot and snack collector</li>
<li>John Heffernan is <strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's unusual world</li>
<li>Celia Imrie is <strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne</li>
<li>Paterson Joseph is <strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess</li>
<li>Sasha Luss is <strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara's</li>
<li>Juliette Motamed is <strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the "proper" preservation of history</li>
<li>Sigourney Weaver is <strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents</li>
<li>August Wittgenstein is <strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these descriptions, I am going to say Lukas is a love interest in a similar vein to Daniel Craig's Alex West from the first Angelina Jolie-fronted Tomb Raider film.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Isaacs' Uncle Atlus will be like. The last time I remember hearing his name pop up was in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>: Blood Ties DLC, when he was trying to get Croft Manor from Lara. It didn't sound like he and Lara exactly saw eye to eye. Also, I hope we don't get too bogged down in any Daddy issues, as I am going to assume Lara is once again an orphan in the upcoming series.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider has always been defined by bold storytelling and unforgettable characters, and these new cast members bring incredible depth and gravitas to the series,"  <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner">said Peter Friedlander</a>, head of Amazon MGM Studios. "With talents like Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs joining the ensemble, we're elevating this world in exciting new ways, and can't wait for our global Prime Video audience to experience this next chapter of Tomb Raider."</p><p>Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>. Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming for Tomb Raider is expected to kick off later this month, on 19th January.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Crystal Dynamics</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst. Revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sends Lara to Northern India</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">takes place some time after series entry Underworld</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">Alix Wilton Regan will portray Lara in both Catalyst and next year's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, which is a remake of the first game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first batch of Xbox Game Pass games for 2026 <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/06/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-wave-1/">has been revealed</a>, with a strong lineup of seven games joining the service, including Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, and three titles already included in the service at the Ultimate tier now available at the second-rung, Premium tier.</p>



<p>One user on ResetEra called this batch a "<em>damn good month</em>," and it's no surprise considering how many big names are included in the first dump of Game Pass games to start off 2026. It even has at least one day-one release with MIO: Memories in Orbit, a new metroidvania from publisher Focus Entertainment and developer Douze Dixièmes.</p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest additions to the subscription service this month are the aforementioned Resident Evil Village and Star Wars: Outlaws, along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, the new remaster of the original Little Nightmares</a> that was released last year and included in any player's pre-order of Little Nightmares III.</p>

<p>Here's the full list of what's coming to Game Pass this month:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to get back into reading in 2026, or just read more? Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>I love my paperbacks, but over time, I have realized how much more convenient digital copies are for reading on the go. You also get more variety, instead of feeling stuck with that one book you grabbed in a hurry and aren’t really in the mood for anymore – coming from someone who often picks a classic when all that the brain needs is some Murakami.</p>
<p>If you’re not a fan of reading on your phone or tablet, a Kindle can be an excellent investment. There are multiple versions available, but right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">Amazon is offering a chance to pick the latest Kindle Colorsoft at a nice 20% discount, for just $200.</a> You’re saving a sweet $50 on a reading solution that makes it easy to have all your favorite titles accessible at all times, wherever you go. Note that this deal ends soon, so it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep All Your Favorite Titles Close</h2>
<p>For $200, you’re getting a modest 7-inch, high-contrast Colorsoft display that’s easy on the eyes. Unlike the Kindle Paperwhite display, which is optimized for black and white reading, this version brings all the colors to life. It’s great for stories that include illustrations and maps – think The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wheel of Time – plus comics where color really enhances the overall experience. You can even highlight your favorite scenes in yellow, orange, blue, or pink, and come back to revisit the moments later.</p>
<p>The brightness is adjustable. You can tweak the display from white to amber, depending on your environment. Switch to white light when you’re catching up on the latest Arundhati Roy book while soaking up some sun, and move to a warmer setting for bedtime reading. Even better, the Page Color feature inverts the black text and white background of pages of the books for an even more comfortable experience. It’s different from Dark Mode, and still offers colorful images and covers.</p>



<p>Kindle Colorsoft is also waterproof, which means you can take your favorite titles with you by the pool and to the beach, and even in the bathroom! The battery life is another strong selling point, as a single charge via USB-C gets you up to 8 weeks of reading – you read that right. That means you go up to two months without worrying about plugging the device in. This makes it great to take with you on your off-road adventures and long trips.</p>
<p>The Kindle Store lets you browse through more than 15 million titles from authors around the world, while the Kindle Unlimited subscription offers an all-you-can-read access to a wide catalog that includes best sellers. Prime members can read from a selection of eBooks, magazines, comics, manga, and audiobooks with their Prime membership. If you have young readers at home, you can even create a kid’s profile for unlimited access to a kid-friendly library with an Amazon Kids+ subscription.</p>
<p>All things considered, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5794/">we highly recommend the latest Kindle Colorsoft to anyone looking to read more in 2026, especially at its current price of $200.</a> This deal saves you a nice $50 on this device, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about, either. Grab the deal before the price goes back up to $250.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Troy Baker, one of the most well known actors working in video games, believes generative AI could have a positive effect overall on performing arts. Baker thinks it'll cause a reaction whereby people will seek out "authentic" experiences more - live shows, live theatre - and turn away from "gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror".</p>
<p>"AI can create content but it cannot create art," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we">Baker told The Game Business</a> in an interview. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p>
<p>"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'look what AI can do.' It's like, 'yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonise it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there'.</p>
<p>"For the last 2,500 years since we first set foot out onto a stage, humans have been doing this. So maybe we trust that. Maybe we trust that this will be part of the process."</p>
<p>The fear comes from looking at AI from a business point of view, he said. From that perspective, yes, AI is threatening. "There is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans," Baker said. "By far, it can crank it out no problem." But that's where the adverse reaction will come from.</p><p>"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic. And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater'. 'I want to read books'. 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror'.</p>
<p>"I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p>
<p>Troy Baker, whose performances in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> earned him award nominations, is no stranger to dabbling in controversial new tech. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-voice-actor-troy-baker-is-now-promoting-nfts">Baker partnered with an NFT company</a> that was making what it claimed were the world's first voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> - voices you'd own to create content with. Baker's provocative marketing resulted in a fierce backlash and he backed off a bit, but the idea itself doesn't sound far removed from <a href="https://artlist.io/voice-over?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=21312164614&amp;utm_content=181685845406&amp;utm_term=elevenlabs&amp;keyword=elevenlabs&amp;ad=774546804639&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21312164614&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACuwFJ3tEZLqB63gRxh9YtijrhqoX&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EoMuf-EoB1zrFJuepfrM3VN8tZh-XFA7o1IZyYg_5eyStbfw5zRM8kaAtihEALw_wcB">companies like Elevenlabs that are training gen-AIs on actors' voices</a> now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Troy Baker will also star in the vintage Disney noir shooter Mouse: PI for Hire, which is due this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>

            <p>No, I'm not busy. Ignore the very famous actor acting moody in the corner, he'll be quiet if you pay him no mind. Also, do like I am and just pretend my holo-phone doesn't have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/extending-cyberpunk-2077s-pre-heist-rise-through-the-ranks-would-risk-a-meandering-unfocused-experience-argues-cyberpunk-2-director">a million urgent messages</a> about some relic sitting in its inbox. Just sit here on the sofa, in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> flat, and watch as the big flying thing with Dogtown's military dictator's face on it floats between my futuristic kitchen and lounge, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who digs chilling in Cyberpunk, prolific modder Deceptious' latest creation is about the best late new year present I could have asked for. Dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/26674">Apartment Toys</a>', it takes a bunch of flying craft used by Night City's various factions - from Militch choppers to Arasaka AVs - and shrinks them down to serve as interactive models which can fly around a bunch of V's flats.</p>
<p>It grew out of the model Trauma Team AV the base game sticks in V's default flat for beating the Trauma Drama arcade game's high score and the modder's desire to have a <a href="https://x.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2002256774007521640">Christmas-themed SleighV</a> fly around each of the game's more specious abodes. Not one of those rare creations that'll turn your playthrough of a game upside down, but I think it's a neat little addition all the same.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Almost done... going all out, &amp; making sure to justify this as a whole new mod I publish tomorrow!🆕<br>Fixed the landing pad (it had some jank)<br>Added decals + lighting variants to match the chosen AV<br>Applied it all to the apartments (after testing in Corpo)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Modding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Modding</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyberpunk2077?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cyberpunk2077</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3HQ7OqSHR">pic.twitter.com/h3HQ7OqSHR</a></p>— Deceptious - Phil (@DeceptiousPhil) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeceptiousPhil/status/2008023548301058422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Specifically, I think the fact one of the 13 different craft options its currently boasts is the converted ship which flies around over Dogtown reminding you who's boss via some spotlights and an intimidating  passport snap of the person running the district. Or, as I prefer to call it, the Barghest blimp. Now, with a simple button press, it can patrol the unruly streets of your posh corporate plaza digs.</p><p>No more worries about the clutter you've amassed getting any bright ideas about overthrowing tyrants. Kurt's floaty face is on the case, gently jetting around to make sure everything's in order. Make sure you salute him every time he completes one of his laps. Or, delve into the mod's settings and toggle the looping flight option on. Then he'll patrol until the synthetic cows come home.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, you'll need a small pile of typical Cybermodding frameworks. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107">Cyber Engine Tweaks</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198?tab=description">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518?tab=description">Native Settings UI</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious Quest Core</a>. The Phantom Liberty DLC's also a must-have. Also, for more ways to waste time not thinking about your impending doom in Cyberpunk, another modder created the means for it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">serve you Night City lingo-heavy word puzzles</a> last year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-forerunner-165-hits-record-low-as-a-running-smartwatch-alternative-to-apple-watch-perfect-for-your-new-years-fitness-goals-2000656782</link>
            <guid>1398403</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="487">Data plays a crucial role in improving your performance as an athlete. To enhance your speed, boost your endurance, and maintain a consistent training routine, investing in a top-notch running watch is key. Whether you’re preparing for a marathon, gearing up for a local 5K, or simply running a couple times a week, having a reliable running watch is essential to measuring your efforts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Right now, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount on the Garmin Forerunner 165, slashing its price by $50—down to just $200.</a></p>
<p data-start="489" data-end="801">The Garmin Forerunner 165 is tailored for individuals leading active lifestyles and those focused on fitness. It boasts a 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen that offers crystal-clear visibility, whether you’re running in direct sunlight or during nighttime.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="803" data-end="830">Your Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="832" data-end="1301">The Garmin Forerunner 165’s built-in GPS lets you track your running routes and it provides accurate data on your distance, pace, and other essential metrics. The watch also includes wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it perfect for athletes who train according to specific heart rate zones. With over 25 pre-loaded activity profiles, it supports a broad range of sports, including running, HIIT, cycling, strength training, and more.</p>
<p data-start="1303" data-end="1670">In addition to its advanced tracking capabilities, the Garmin Forerunner 165 can serve as a personal fitness coach. Using the Garmin Connect app, you can access free adaptive training plans from expert coaches, which can be synced directly to your watch. This takes the guesswork out of your training, ensuring a more efficient approach to improving your performance.</p>
<p data-start="1672" data-end="2095">Beyond workouts, the Garmin Forerunner 165 continues to monitor your overall health throughout the rest of your day. It keeps track of your heart rate, both during physical activities and while at rest. A favorite of mine is the Body Battery score, which evaluates your energy levels based on factors like heart rate and activity. This helps you identify the optimal times to train or rest, ensuring you stay at your peak performance.</p>


<p data-start="2097" data-end="2447">Battery life is impressive on the Forerunner 165. With GPS active, the watch can last up to 19 hours, which is perfect for long runs. When GPS isn’t in use, the battery can last for up to 11 days. Someone who is running multiple times a week will likely find themselves only need to charge the watch once a week. This makes it far superior to other smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch, which typically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2449" data-end="2827">The Garmin Forerunner 165 also offers smart features similar to those found on more expensive smartwatches. When connected to a compatible smartphone, the watch allows you to receive notifications for emails, texts, and alerts directly on your wrist. This means you can keep your phone tucked away while staying connected and informed during your workouts or throughout the day.</p>
<p data-start="2829" data-end="3118" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">Typically priced at $250, it’s currently available for just $200 with a 20% discount</a>. You can select between two stylish band colors: black or white, depending on your preference.</p>

<p>Amazon has revealed a wave of new casting announcements for its upcoming live-action Tomb Raider series, expanding the roster around Sophie Turner, who was previously confirmed to play the iconic Lara Croft.</p>



<p>First launched in 1996, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a> has become one of gaming’s most recognisable franchises, spawning multiple film adaptations and animated projects over the years. Now, Amazon is preparing its own take on Lara Croft’s globe-trotting adventures, with casting details beginning to shed light on the shape of the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-sigourney-weaver-jason-isaacs-amp-more-cast-for-amazon-s-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, &amp; More Cast For Amazon’s Tomb Raider Series</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a star-studded cast. Image by Amazon.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It was exclusively revealed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1q5jcp0/reddit_exclusive_new_cast_and_characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tomb Raider subreddit</a> that eleven new cast members had joined the roster for Amazon’s upcoming Tomb Raider series. Not only have the actors been revealed, but so have who they will be playing. </p>



<p>Three cast members join as returning canon roles from the Tomb Raider video game franchise. These are:</p>

Other additions include museum curators, government officials, rival raiders, and Lara’s personal pilot, helping to flesh out the wider world around the adventurer. </p>



<p>The full list of actors and their associated characters is available in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Actor Name</th><th data-align="center">Character Name</th><th data-align="center">Character Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Jack Bannon</td><td data-align="center">Gerry</td><td data-align="center">Gerry is Lara’s personal pilot and snack collector.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">John Heffernan</td><td data-align="center">David</td><td data-align="center">David is an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara’s unusual world.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Celia Imrie</td><td data-align="center">Francine</td><td data-align="center">Francine is the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Paterson Joseph</td><td data-align="center">Thomas Warner</td><td data-align="center">Thomas Warner is a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sashu Luss</td><td data-align="center">Sasha</td><td data-align="center">Sasha is a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara’s.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Juliette Motamed</td><td data-align="center">Georgia</td><td data-align="center">Georgia is a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the ‘proper’ preservation of history.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sigourney Weaver</td><td data-align="center">Evelyn Wallis</td><td data-align="center">A mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara’s talents.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">August Wittgenstein</td><td data-align="center">Lukas</td><td data-align="center">Lukas is an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Turner described <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft</a> as a “fierce female role model,” while co-showrunner Phoebe Waller-Bridge praised the cast as a blend of fan favourites and exciting new additions. With production details still under wraps, the calibre of talent involved has only heightened anticipation for the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO revealed a brand new platform called SMART Play at CES 2026, which brings more life to each creation. </p>



<p>LEGO is known to provide sets for a variety of franchises, including gaming and other entertainment media. In recent times, we have seen the company unveil sets for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-game-boy-set-releasing-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Game Boy</a> as well as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a>. However, their latest reveal is not a new set, but a platform that will change the way all other sets work.</p>











<p>Revealed in a new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement?locale=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, LEGO SMART Play is a new platform that features “more than twenty patented world-firsts within its technology.” The centre’s focus is the LEGO SMART Brick, which features a custom-made chip that enables responsive physical play. The SMART Brick comes with technologies like sensors, accelerometers, light sensing, and a sound sensor, along with a miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser. It also features easy wireless charging. </p>



<p>The LEGO SMART Tags and LEGO SMART Minifigures, on the other hand, work in tandem with the SMART Bricks, and they respond to the players’ actions with appropriate sounds and behaviours. LEGO SMART Play will launch on March 1, 2026, and the first SMART Play-enabled sets will be LEGO Star Wars sets. </p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-lego-smart-play-star-wars-sets-revealed">LEGO Smart-Play Star Wars Sets Revealed</h2>



<p>Three ‘All-In-One’ LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;sets have been revealed, which feature a LEGO SMART Brick with charger and at least one LEGO SMART Minifigure and LEGO SMART tag.</p>



<ul>
<li>First is LEGO Star Wars SMART Play Luke’s Red Five X-Wing, which is a 584-piece set that includes two SMART Minifigures (Luke Skywalker, in his iconic pilot suit, and Princess Leia), as well as Luke’s trusty companion, R2-D2, and Rebel Crew and Stormtrooper Minifigures.

It’s a solution to the reality of modern gaming, where managing apps, info, and devices is just as critical as performance. This level of control has never existed in a single device before, and only CORSAIR could bring the future of input to market now.”</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other features include an aluminum frame with gasket mounting and six layers of internal sound dampening, cushioned palm rest, and an RGB “mood bar”.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness</link>
            <guid>1398385</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t always describe Goichi Suda and Grasshopper Manufacture’s games, but you know them when you see them. Examples like Let It Die and Lollipop Chainsaw might not resemble each other on paper, but spend any length of time with them and their specific high energy, off-the-wall style, brash tone, and script that's just wall-to-wall one-liners and you'll see that could really only ever come from one place. Just a few minutes with their latest slasher, Romeo Is a Dead Man, and yeah the boys are definitely back in town. But after playing the first two chapters, the latest mad science experiment of an action game helmed by Suda51, it clearly takes some big steps forward in art design and presentation that really raises the “Wow I didn’t see that coming” bar. Even the action, though not revolutionary, feels like a real commitment has been made to evolve the studio’s image from “crazy fun games to watch clips from” to “crazy fun games to spend countless hours with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of Grasshopper-style things that are to be expected in Romeo Is a Dead Man: relentless absurdist humor, gore galore, killing the past, etc. But the signature erratic tone set as far back as Killer7 feels turned up to 11 here. The breakneck pace at which exposition gets sort of vomited at you, scenes change from focused narration to chaotic combat, and more is pretty intense. It’s not necessarily hard to follow, but more than once in my two or so hours with the game did I have to take a minute or two to simply digest what the hell was going on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - January 2026 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as the titular Romeo, who does have himself a Juliet, but the only way this game showed any resemblance to your favorite play from high school is that both of them die. Romeo is a deputy sheriff who gets his face ripped off by an interdimensional zombie ghoul and is transformed into a sort of Space Sheriff Gavan-style superhero that keeps him in a state of undeath and is drafted in to a sort of space time division of the FBI to hunt the sort of monsters that tried to kill him. Juliet, who arrived in Romeo’s little Appalachian town through mysterious circumstances, is actually some kind of extradimensional being who seems to keep popping up in people’s dimensions and mucking up the place, and is one of Romeo’s first targets. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the simple version, completely glossing over things like the fact that the guy who saved Romeo is allegedly his time-traveling grandfather – who is also killed by face eaters but now just lives in a patch on Romeo’s jacket, for starters. Romeo Is a Dead Man’s story might be among the most ridiculous and far flung of Suda and Co.’s gameography, but it holds tightly to its fourth wall-breaking sense of humor and over the top characters that define the studio. It’s relatively easy to follow, and told in such a way to purposefully cast doubt on if what you’re attempting to decipher is even real. But it is engaging, if not always well-written or acted. And even then, it's told through a collage of mixed media that really kept me enthralled.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening sequence is a flyover of a tilt-shifted, handmade diorama. From there, we transition into a standard cutscene rendered in full 3D as one would expect, and the next scene might be a vividly detailed comic strip. Inside levels, small televisions appear with pixelated animations on them that serve as portals transporting you to spaces that look more like the Street Fighter training room with a stock jungle image in the background. When teleporting to your FBI HQ – a ship called The Last Night – you navigate it like a top-down 32-bit Sega Genesis-style RPG. When you die, the “game over” screen is an FMV of a human-like prosthetic face getting melted off. It’s all jarring, and frankly, pretty awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grasshopper games have a bit of a reputation for having stories and presentation given texture through tons of references to pop culture, classic literature, and raucous music, but not having the same sort of depth when it comes time to beat ass, the misunderstood Killer Is Dead excluded. Romeo Is a Dead Man isn’t Devil May Cry, but it has a lot of layered systems that create a combat experience that I really came to like quite a bit. You have basic light and heavy attacks with their own attack strings that can be stopped early but not canceled out with a dodge or something like that, so every swing is a commitment. When surrounded by enemies, even the simple cannon fodder basic zombies, it can be tough to make it out unscathed since these attacks don't stun enemies very reliably, meaning they're often free to slap as you slap them. I spent a lot of my time trying to stay outside of mobs, picking away at the edges with melee attacks or shots with guns at range and avoiding getting overwhelmed until I built enough of my blood meter through my attacks to use a special Bloody Summer attack for big damage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This pretty simple loop was a bit of a let down for me early on, as Chapter 1 lacked attack and enemy variety, or really any challenge or pushback at all. And if I would have stopped my time after slaying the pretty straightforward end-level boss, a towering giant spawned after a Juliet clone ripped off her own head and threw it into a campfire, I would have missed the metric ton of new stuff that drops right after that gives Romeo so many more toys to work with.  After flying back to HQ to report a job well done, I could buy more and different weapons – all which add their own sort of approach to regular combat – and could be swapped between in the field. I don’t think the melee weapons forced me to change my playstyle in the way a heavy greatsword, set of robot gauntlets, and spear that split into dual blades should, but the ranged weapons did. The pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, and machine gun all forced me to work around their strengths way differently, if I was going to choose to lean on them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo is a Dead Man’s weirdest and best feature, though, are bastards – zombies that you can grow like plants that have special abilities that you can equip to use in battle, like one that spits poison or one that blows itself up on enemies. This gives you so many more ways to control crowds and keep your offense effective against a cohort of bad guys that also grow more deadly. Basic foes with guns (at least on the 3 out of 4 difficulty I was playing on) provided a significant jump in danger when they repeatedly shot at me while being tucked behind hordes of zombies. Mix that with the spicier sort of mutants that ram you with their giant tomato heads or scorpion-shaped bomb lobbers that leave toxic trails, and any given scenario could become a death trap. Even the second boss, a giant mutant head you fight between two floors of a mall food court, is a huge step up in quality from the first.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Romeo Is a Dead Man - Reveal Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty old-school action game. There aren’t a lot of nuanced mechanics like dodges cancels. There's not even a parry or a block – at least in the beginning. But I enjoyed the relatively simple push and pull of each stage with the systems that exist quite a lot, even if the camera became a monster on its own. With everything properly in frame things still get very busy on screen very quickly, mostly due to the truly egregious levels of blood and particle effects that come off of enemies as you slash them up. Mix that with the text bubbles that pop up from characters trying to give you some unvoiced dialogue usually fight in the middle of combat and it can be hard to focus on the task at hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes despite itself, Romeo Is a Dead Man is shaping up to be a frantic action romp worthy of the Grasshopper Manufacture pedigree. Its somewhat traditional action mechanics don’t really test your reflexes and make an underwhelming first impression, but does pay off patience when rewarding good positioning and smart use of your bastard skills to get a leg up on the more eccentric enemies past the first chapter. It’s crazy throughout, using strong humor and marvelous art direction at a breakneck speed to make its truly bonkers space-traveling love story one worth patiently waiting until February 11 for.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-brings-gameplay-maturity-to-suda51s-signature-madness]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1398382</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The screen they play on may be small, but for competitors in the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship (PMGC), the tournament is anything but. Between 12-14 December, 16 teams from all around the world gathered in Thailand to give it their all on a giant stage in front of a legion of cheering fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This major global competition is the conclusion of more than a year of training and face-offs for these professional teams, all leading towards the prestigious event in the circuit. In qualifying for this ultimate trial, teams went head-to-head once more to take the 2025 PMGC title and the lion’s share of $3m — one of the largest prize pools in esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn’t all, the tournament expanded beyond the venue’s walls, with PUBG MOBILE activations popping up around Bangkok. IGN was on the ground to witness the grand finals, soak up the festival-like atmosphere, and learn more about how PUBG MOBILE Esports is growing in 2026.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/bambam-4-1767612303389.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Thai singer Bam Bam performed in the opening ceremony </figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>DROPPING INTO BANGKOK</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Grand Finals of 2025 PMGC may have taken place on the 5th floor of the luxurious Siam Paragon shopping mall, but the celebrations extended far and wide. Both inside and outside the venue, PUBG MOBILE pop-ups, collaborations, and installations brought a vibrant energy to proceedings, providing fans and players who travelled from across the globe with unique experiences, in addition to the spectacle of the Grand Finals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On our first day, after entering past the plane-themed check-in desk, we found ourselves in the PUBG United Fan Zone, an area seemingly filled with as many activities as there were attendees. This marked a pivotal moment for PUBG MOBILE, as it collaborated with PUBG for the first time ever to celebrate a long-standing history of competition and sportsmanship conveyed through the 2025 PMGC and PUBG Global Championship 2025 (PGC). This certainly showed, as lining the walls of the Fan Zone were interactive experiences ranging from a human claw machine, glambot, PUBG café, Frosty Barbershop (where I got a PUBG MOBILE-themed temporary tattoo), Metro Royale battle experience, and a World of Wonder Challenge area where players could get hands on with curated UGC experiences.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG United Fanzone</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the centre of the Fan Zone, the PUBG MOBILE Air Drop Stage hosted multiple performances from bands (Thai artists Paper Planes were a particular highlight, getting the crowd jumping and singing along with their pop-punk anthems), as well as several Muay Thai fights – truly ‘kicking’ things off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the opening ceremony and 2026 PUBG MOBILE Esports announcements (more on that later), we swung by the PDP Creative Zone, home to a colossal PUBG MOBILE helmet that had been decorated by selected PDP artists and designers during the event. As if that wasn’t enough, the approach to the stage also featured pop-ups collaborations with Porsche and Thai bakery brand famous for its adorable mascot character, Butterbear.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/butterbear-1-1767612397373.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Butterbear mascot on stage with James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that was just a selection of what was going on in the venue! Once the first matches of the Grand Finals were finished, it was time for Bangkok to show that PUBG United had arrived in the city. After a quick trip to the Chao Phraya River in a PUBG MOBILE branded Tuk Tuk, we witnessed the PUBG MOBILE drone light show featuring hundreds of drones lighting up the sky. These formed iconic PUBG MOBILE imagery, including ‘Winner Winner Chicken Dinner’, characters dropping into the map, and appropriately, Air Drop crates. Plus, if you kept an eye out on the Chao Phraya River, you could even see the PUBG MOBILE Giant Boat making a splash.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/06/drone-show-1767690333375.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Drone show lit up the sky by the Chao Phraya River</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>ONE WORLD, TWO CHAMPIONS</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned, for the first time ever, both the PUBG MOBILE and PUBG Global Championships came together for a unified global event – PUBG United – a celebration of both games and their communities. The sense of two giants coming together was felt, and illustrated, by the two giant back-to-back stages that hosted the Grand Finals, with gameplay and crucial team standings displayed on the wall-to-wall screens, giving attendees a great view of the action wherever they were sat.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/fmvp-1767612595763.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alpha Gaming player Top was crowned MVP for the PMGC 2025</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of giants, PUBG MOBILE’s collaboration with luxury brands took a big step up this year. Building on a successful collaboration campaign between Porsche and PUBG MOBILE, it was announced that Porsche would invigorate the PMGC stage with the prize of a Porsche Cayenne to the MVP player of the 2025 PMGC Grand Finals. For 2025 PMGC MVP ‘TOP’, from team Alpha Gaming, it's likely this softened the blow of coming third place overall.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PMGC Winners - Alpha 7 </h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the winners however, another collaboration offered up its own prize, as the collaboration between PUBG MOBILE and renowned luxury fashion house Balenciaga saw the two brands converge their unique identities again, this time with an exclusive designed jacket that only the Champions of the 2025 PUBG MOBILE Global Championship had the honour of wearing and owning. With this, in addition to the glory of being crowned 2025 PMGC Champions and lifting the trophy, team Alpha 7 esports were adorned with exclusive 2025 PMGC Champion jackets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>MOBILE GROWTH</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow. With more than 1 billion downloads around the world, and over 50 million daily active users, PUBG MOBILE is one of the most popular mobile games in the world – so it tracks that the game’s esports scene is also hugely popular, and continues to grow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This growth and success was exemplified by PUBG MOBILE being awarded Mobile Esports of the Year at the Esports Awards for the second time. It’s no surprise then that at this year’s PMGC, PUBG MOBILE recorded its highest peak viewership in five years, with more than 1.3 million concurrent viewers watching the Grand Finals across the globe. This peak was reached between matches 16-18, in the last few pivotal moments of the competition which saw Alpha 7, ULF Esports, and Alpha Gaming battle it out for the title which was well within reach of all three teams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things for PUBG MOBILE are only set to get even better, and as the new year approaches, a new season of PUBG MOBILE esports events begins, and as was announced by James Yang, Senior Director of Global esports at Level Infinite, the PUBG MOBILE Esports calendar is looking even busier in 2026…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>WHAT’S NEXT FOR PUBG MOBILE ESPORTS IN 2026</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building on 2025’s PUBG MOBILE’s esports experience, which featured over one-million players from over 180 countries and regions, Yang unveiled a series of updates regarding the future of PUBG MOBILE Esports, including a refreshed competitive structure and a doubling down on support for grassroots and amateur level esports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest shake up coming in 2026 is that instead of following the previous Super League structure, there will be two PMGO tournaments spread across two seasons, expanding qualification routes and increasing the number of opportunities for players of all levels to compete at the top. As usual, both these PMGOs will be open to amateur and professional teams, allowing more fans to compete at the top of their game and earn rewards.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/18/pubgm-2026-roadmap-3-1766076940753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The PUBG MOBILE esports official tournament roadmap</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first stage in this format will see more than 30 PUBG MOBILE National Championships taking place across eight regions globally. These will feed into regional qualifiers, determining which teams advance. The 2026 PMGO Season 1 will take place in South East Asia with a share of $500,000 USD on offer, while the second season will be held for the first time in Pakistan with the same prize pool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teams who accumulate the most points across the two seasons will earn their spot at the 2026 PMGC, which returns to Turkiye after its previous appearance there back in 2023, set to deliver the biggest PMGC tournament to date, with another hefty $3m prize pool up for grabs.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/18/pubgm-2026-roadmap-8-1766076788858.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PMGC 2026 returns to Türkiye</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Before that is the return of the PUBG MOBILE World Cup (PMWC) as part of the Esports World Cup for the third year running. Held in Riyadh, next year’s tournament looks to further the esports mobile game of the year’s global presence and growing audience, and solidify PUBG MOBILE’s position as an esports leader.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside these major changes to the annual format, players can also expect integration across the board that aims to fulfil many of the same goals of making esports more accessible for everyone, everywhere. Firstly, it will be easier than ever for organisers to create their own competitions, as the registration process for third-parties has been streamlined, and for competitors across the globe, the enhancement of the in-game participation system means they’ll be able to join an esports tournament with just a few clicks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GET INVOLVED</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Bangkok closed out the year with another successful PMGC. PUBG United celebrated everything fans love about the game, with activations and pop-ups sustaining buzz surrounding the main event of the Grand Finals. As players and fans gear up for 2026, new opportunities to compete present themselves, will you be taking part?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Download</em><em><strong> PUBG MOBILE</strong></em><em> for free via the </em><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pubg-mobile/id1330123889" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em>App Store</em></u></a><em> and </em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><em>Google Play Store</em></u></a><em>.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-pubg-mobile-esports-3m-global-championship-took-over-bangkok-and-whats-next-in-2026]]></content:encoded>

Grab the tiny hamster, point it towards approaching enemies, and watch MOCHI-O obliterate approaching enemy ships with its ever-evolving abilities in tower defense-style combat. </p><p>Outfit MOCHI-O with various weapons and abilities, and feast on bundles of seeds dropped by defeated foes to gain XP. Collect enough seeds to level up MOCHI-O’s base attributes, like firing rate, crit chance, attack range, and cooldown reductions to create a custom playstyle.</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>So, what of those games? Well, I know our Ian was very taken with Atomfall, and he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">celebrated being able to bop a chap over the head with a cricket bat as the poor blighter was having a wee against a wall</a>.</p>
<p>"If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">Eurogamer's Atomfall review</a>.</p>
<p>Another favourite, at least with me, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">our Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> was a bit hit and miss for many of us here at Eurogamer. I had a decent enough time with it, others not so much. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the requirements, the studio has announced a partnership with Nvidia for 007 First Light, saying the power of GeForce's latest RTX technologies will allow the team to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">007 First Light is set to arrive on 27th May</a>. As well as PC, the game will also be available across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">announced that rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in 007 First Light as black market dealer Bawma</a>.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>
