<p>Could a certain series make a return?</p>

<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e0ffb89a1c456/super-mario-galaxy-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of Mario's 40th anniversary this week, NBCUniversal has apparently registered multiple 'Super Mario Galaxy Movie' domain names.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Direct broadcast is obviously taking place later today, and <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">this recent discovery has now led to speculation</a> about the title and theme of the upcoming movie and even future Mario movies. It seems to have also reignited hopes for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> video game entries to make a return in some way or form.</p>
<p>At this stage, nothing has been officially announced, so there's no guarantee these newly discovered registrations will lead to any confirmations or reveals.</p>

<p>There are also some theories floating around about this potentially being an <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/next-mario-movie-may-actually-be-called-super-mario-galaxy/">attempt to "throw" fans off the trail</a>. In saying this, it's still generating plenty of buzz being so close to Super Mario's anniversary and the latest Direct presentation. Adding some fuel to the fire is a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1966261624622416067">rumoured 'Old Spice' product leak</a> from earlier this year, which featured character renders as well as a title logo for 'The Super Mario Galaxy Movie'.</p>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/super-mario-world-looks-to-be-the-official-name-of-the-next-mario-movie">finding in May on the official NBCUniversal website</a>, which suggested the next Mario Movie (due out in April 2026) would be titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>. However, the same web page removed the reference to this movie title not long after the news began circulating online.</p>
<p>When the follow up Mario Movie was originally announced in March 2024, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto mentioned at the time how it would be "based on the world of the Super Mario Bros. series".</p>

<p>It's been a busy year for Nintendo and to help with all of the announcements in March of this year it released its very own new-style mobile app.</p>
<p>Nintendo Today! has been updated multiple times since its release, but today's update is arguably the best one yet. It adds a new Kirby theme, additional language support and also some other handy features.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of the app's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-today/id6736725704">Apple Store page</a>:</p>
<h3>Version History</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>2.0</h4>
Sep 12, 2025
<p>- The Kirby™ theme has been added.</p>
<p>- Additional languages are supported: English (European), Spanish (European), Korean, and Traditional Chinese.</p>
<p>- The app is now available in South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lym5i3t32i2k">highlighted by OatmealDome on social media</a>, this update also includes some "special features" for the upcoming Nintendo Live 2025 Tokyo event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Special features were also added for Nintendo Live 2025 TOKYO attendees. Interestingly, the app verifies that you are physically present in the venue and locks the features if you are not. It does this by listening for an inaudible sound-wave signal that is broadcast inside."</p>

<p>Mojang has reconfirmed its next <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Live broadcast of 2025 will be returning later this month on 27th September.</p>
<p>This show will provide an update on vanilla Minecraft - including "fresh info" from the developers, the inside scoop on unannounced game drops, and much more. This will then be followed by a "Deep Dig After Show", where the team dives into the new features and content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Minecraft LIVE is our own super special show that gives you the inside info on everything happening in the world of Minecraft!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be able to watch this broadcast via minecraft.net, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p>This follows a broadcast earlier this year in March, which showcased the 'Spring To Life' update, shared an update about the Minecraft Movie, gave fans a look at the Vibrant Visuals update and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deahas-thed-star.1295406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up early this morning and, like most mornings, the first thing I did was check my phone for work messages, which mostly just means catching up on <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what fresh horrors have taken place in the United States while I've been asleep</a>. The second thing I did was open Facebook to answer some Marketplace questions, where I was greeted with something that made me wonder whether I'd actually woken up at all.<br></p><p>I don't read The Independent, and am on record as being <em>extremely </em>scared of Lego Adults, so I have no idea why I was served that story. But seeing that image turn up on the social media page of a large, established newspaper stopped me dead in my tracks.</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>The more I looked over the words (or word, since only one of them is actually a word), the more I wondered: what the fuck happened here? We live in an age where job cuts in the media industry have become so commonplace that copy editors, once the backbone of newspapers the world over, are now an endangered species. So this could just be a typo on the image that slipped through because some underpaid social media person was having a bad day, or because the story's author had also been responsible for "socialing" the post and got sloppy in the middle of all the admin that requires (relatable, since we all post our own stories on social media here as well!).</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>That doesn't feel like a regular typo though. It's not an autocorrect either. You can see where the words "Death Star" are <em>supposed </em>to be, but the way it all falls apart in the middle--even the double space between "thed" and "Star"--makes it seem unlikely it's just a slip of the keyboard. Like it's <em>so bad</em> that even the most cursory glance--like I managed at 6am in bed!--could have seen something was wrong, if not while typing it then at least once it had been published. Say it out loud and it doesn't even sound like modern English, it sounds more like:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Eowyn Sing At Theodred Funeral - LOTR The Two Towers (Extended Edition)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV-2sgxnF8c?start=46&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We also live in an age of AI slop, and an ownership class that is absolutely frothing at the mouth to automate as much of the media business as it can. Maybe this alphabetical casserole was instead a result of an AI-generated social media post shitting the bed in the middle of a sentence before recovering to nail the landing? But then is that really how it works? The tell-tale signs of AI writing are usually stuff like generic phrasing and a weird tone, not the structural collapse of a single word. And while The Independent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/service/how-and-why-we-use-ai-at-the-independent-b2685631.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed it uses AI as a publication (without specifying what <em>for</em>, exactly)</a>, it also says anything made by AI gets signed off by a human, and I refuse to believe anyone employed by a newspaper would miss something like “Deahas thed Star”.</p><p>So I'm at a loss. I, someone who has been writing, editing and being edited professionally for nearly two decades, have finally found a typo so bad it's making me question whether the word "typo" is even enough anymore. This isn't that. It's something else. Something beyond, that I think for any or all of the reasons above we could only see on Facebook, for a newspaper's social media post, in 2025.</p><p>I think the worst thing about it though, worse than the way "Deahas thed Star" will be stuck in my head like a thorn for the rest of the week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline/posts/the-mammoth-9000-piece-lego-death-star-features-38-minifigures-the-most-ambitiou/1293700442785946/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the fact that at time of writing this story the original Facebook post has been live for <em>15 hours</em> and hasn't been fixed</a>. Which suggests that there aren't just mistakes being made on The Independent's production line, but that there's nobody answering the phone or even looking things over at the other end, either. If I'd made a typo that bad I'd have been harassed in my DMs almost <em>instantly</em>, mostly by my peers but also by well-meaning readers. Yet this thing, this unshaped clay lump of a sentence, looks like it's going to sit there for a day or more, maybe forever, leading more and more commenters like poor Gordon here to have to ask:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy"><h3>OK, But You Do Know You’re Eulogizing Charlie Kirk, Right?</h3></a><p>Are we talking about the same guy, NYT, MSNBC, and Gavin Newsom?</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history"><h3>Signal Rolls Out Secure Backups Just After I Had To Nuke My Message History</h3></a><p>Signal is allowing users to opt-in to secure backups in their beta, one of their most requested features.

the 2025 edition makes one change to the design: Astro's eyes on the touchpad match his smiling face from the PS5 game. The original edition depicted Astro's eyes as circles. The updated design matches Astro's face on the game's cover art.</p><p>Outside of that small, but noticeable alteration, this is the same controller that launched in September 2024.</p><p>The white and blue color scheme simply looks fantastic, so it's not surprising this controller was popular enough to warrant a second edition. It's arguably the best-looking Limited Edition DualSense yet. It also helps that Astro Bot is one of the best 3D platformers ever made and has a strong argument for best overall PS5 game.</p><p>Note: The links below are search results where you can expect to find the controller once retailers create store pages.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday afternoon, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot during a stop on his “American Comeback” tour at Utah Valley University. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/death-charlie-kirk-lays-bare-deep-us-political-divisions-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died shortly after</a>. In the 24 hours that followed, liberal news networks, publications, and politicians have tripped over themselves to eulogize Kirk, with the New York Times’ Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming</a> that Kirk was “practicing politics the right way,” while California podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/governor.ca.gov/post/3lyjajnblcs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> "the best way to honor Charlie's memory is to continue his work: engage with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse.”&nbsp;</p><p>After MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd noted, quite reasonably, that "hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” the network <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired him</a>. The New York Yankees, neither a publication nor a politician, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2025/09/10/yankees-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/86085914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held a moment of silence</a> for Kirk.</p><p>These are just a handful of examples. Conspicuously, many such teary-eyed odes neglect to quote or substantially discuss the views of the man himself.

Kirk, who dropped out of community college in Chicago, responded by advocating for the "MRS degree." "We should bring back the celebration of MRS degrees," he said.

But Kirk knew how to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shooting/684173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy up to power</a> and work the algorithm – the only two skills you need to gain influence in a landscape where viewership, as opposed to expertise or a legitimate desire to better your community, is king. This is a system that makes monsters, encourages them to run rampant, and then scratches its head at the carnage they’ve caused. It is ill-equipped to grapple with the age-old adage “what goes around comes around,” because that would require accepting a measure of culpability.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-video-graphic-online-social-media-6cfd4dfde356b960aeea69c01ea3ec34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many saw images of gruesome violence</a> in their algorithmically generated feeds. Some expressed outrage, acting as though this was an anomaly, and perhaps it was. Perhaps they have not spent the past almost-two years opening Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram or whatever else and being greeted by images of charred Palestinian children. Maybe the endless stream of unspeakable darkness has made them numb. Or maybe, like many pundits and elected officials, they are aware of the horrors visited upon Gaza, but to them, those are acceptable losses – bodies, but not real people. State violence is the background hum of this country, after all. It does not count as the “<a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1965867418863235410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political violence</a>” so many politicians and pundits rushed to decry yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s death, like much of his life, took place on a stage. Despite the artificiality of such a setting, that makes him <em>more </em>real to some Americans – and clearly to those eulogizing him.

Some of the pundits fake-crying for Kirk probably found his views privately appalling. Again, networks made the deliberate <em>choice </em>to shy away from engaging with the substance of his debates. They were almost certainly aware, at least on some level, of the kinds of things he regularly said. But that didn’t matter. They had to put on a show. The show, after all, is what keeps the meat grinder that is America moving, and it must – at all costs – go on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">September Neowsletter</a>, Slay the Spire and Slay the Spire 2 developer Mega Crit has delayed the early access release date for Slay the Spire 2 outside of 2025<em> "to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>."</p>



<p>When Slay the Spire 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">first revealed in April 2024</a>, Mega Crit had set a 2025 release window for its early access launch. Today, at the top of the newsletter, the studio confirmed that "<em>after a lot of internal discussion</em>," the decision to delay the early access launch of Slay the Spire 2 was made.</p>



<p>"<em>We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!),</em>" Mega Crit continued. "<em>Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There's no single dramatic reason. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.</em>"</p>



<p>Following that opening statement, a FAQ from the studio's community manager answers a few potentially top-of-mind questions players might have after hearing the news, with the top item addressing any speculation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">Slay the Spire 2 is another game that decided to get out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a>. Which, according to the Mega Crit, was not the case.</p>



<p>The real answer is a mix of everything Mega Crit mentioned above. Adding new features, characters, general content, and then polishing it all so that it's ready for prime time.</p>



<p>At least in this case, Mega Crit's coy mention that it would be on a Thursday in March gives us a few options as to which one the specific date is. The real date will be revealed closer to release, but for now, you can cast lots between it being Thursday, March 5th, 12th, 19th, or 26th, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is out now on PC via Steam and the Epic Store. And the looter shooter sequel is already the biggest <em>Borderlands</em> launch on Steam, with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">200,000 concurrent</a> players just a few hours after its release. But reviews on Steam aren’t great, as many players are struggling to even play the co-op FPS.</p> <p>On September 11, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched on PC. The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">Gearbox’s<em> Borderlands 3</em></a> is a bigger, better, and wilder experience than the previous game, featuring a host of smart changes and additions to the classic looting-shooting formula. However, that’s only the case if you can actually play the game and enjoy it. And on PC, players are reporting lots of performance issues, even on hardware that Gearbox listed as meeting the needed specs.</p> <p>As of 4:30 pm EST on Steam, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Borderlands 4</a></em> has about 2,000 reviews that are perfectly divided between negative and positive, giving the game a 50 percent mixed status. That’s no good! Scrolling through reviews, the biggest complaints seem to be not about the content of the game, but about how poorly it performs on various hardware setups. Players are also complaining about stuttering and hitching, or being forced to use DLSS to play the game at a stable framerate. Others can’t even boot the game up, reporting crashes before they even get into the action.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are also plenty of reviews from people saying they had no issues at all and claiming that people complaining need to upgrade their PCs. This is the internet, so of course it devolved into a war with various sides and factions.</p> <p>In the reviews on Steam, the most popular culprits people are blaming for the bad performance include Unreal Engine 5 and DRM protection software Denuvo. Over the last year or so, Unreal Engine 5 has become a target online as players believe the engine isn’t well-suited to big games and is hard to optimize. The complaints have gotten so loud online that <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-remake-capcom-2000620968#:~:text=Epic%20boss%20says,can%20step%20in.%E2%80%9D">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a> even stepped in recently to defend the engine and lay the blame on devs who aren’t focused on optimization early enough in the cycle.</p>

 <h2>My experience playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC</h2> <p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC for the last week, and my experience has been up and down. When I first got the game, I was playing on an RTX 3070 and struggled to run it at 1080p at 60FPS. I upgraded my rig to an RTX 5070 (something I had been planning to do for a few months now), and <em>Borderlands 4</em> ran much better. However, I still found that I needed to run the game with DLSS on and frame gen to reach 120 FPS at 1080 with some settings kicked down to medium.&nbsp; Considering the specs in the machine, I was surprised by how power hungry the game is, and I’ll admit that I continue to be disappointed with Unreal Engine 5 games.</p> <p>That said, ever since I found some settings that worked and downloaded the latest drivers, which weren’t available when I first got access to the game, I’ve been having a great time playing the game on PC. It mostly locks to 120 with my current settings and setup, and it feels great. I should also point out, though, that there’s been some chatter indicating that the day-one patch for the game, which arrived shortly before launch, may have caused problems that weren’t present when critics and content creators were playing it pre-release. In my quick tests, I’ve found the most recent patch, the one people are playing with on Steam right now, seems to bring with it some issues that weren’t present before the day-one patch. But I need to play more to really see if things are broken.</p> <p>I hope Gearbox issues a patch on PC soon to help improve things a bit. Or at the very least, get rid of Denuvo ASAP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 is currently out on PC, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">IGN</a>, it's already become the biggest Borderlands game on Steam ever, an hour after it went live, with a concurrent player count that dwarfs the rest of its predecessors. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this writing, Borderlands 4 has 201,273 players in-game. The next closest concurrent player count for games in the Borderlands series goes to Borderlands 2, which has a max concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/49520/charts/">124,678 players</a>. Borderlands 3 only has a peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/">93,820</a>.</p>



<p>Players around the world who are intending to play the game on PC can jump onto Steam or the Epic Games Store and jump into Borderlands 4 right now, while console players will have to wait a few more hours, depending on where you live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As a reminder, Steam is not a full picture of any game's player base, since we never get to see console player concurrent numbers in the same way, and as it currently stands with Borderlands 4, the game isn't even available to some console players across the world.</p>



<p>That said, this is an undeniably strong start for Gearbox's latest entry in the franchise, which is making a return after what many regarded an abysmal previous release with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/borderlands-3/"> Borderlands 3</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you seen this guy on TikTok playing games in the most serene places imaginable? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer">The Scenic Gamer</a> travels all over playing games with iconic locations while he is set up in their real-life counterparts (or the closest thing he can find to it). He’s slaying <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>at the beach and&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em> in the center of Yellowstone National Park — all on an old Toshiba CRT. Dude’s living the dream. But how’s he managing to power that TV and Nintendo GameCube without an outlet for miles? If you want to follow in his footsteps, <strong>you’ll need portable power station such as the Anker 521</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">The mini generator is normally listed at $200, but for a limited time you can get it for 20% off.</a> That brings the price down by $40 so you only have to pay $160.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Anker 521 portable power station comes equipped with six different ports to supply you with all your power needs when out in the wild. Along the front of the unit, you’ll find two AC ports, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet. You can recharge or power up to six devices at once.</p>

<p>The power station is capable of fast, reliable charging. The Anker 521 can keep a 40W mini fridge running for over five hours. Keep a fan going for nearly six. Or recharge a 13Wh camera more than 15 times over. A 12Wh smartphone can be brought back from zero to 100% 16.5 times over. Power times can be extended further by using power-saving mode. Featured on the front of the power station is a LED display providing info on the power output and remaining battery life of the anker 521 itself.</p>



<h2>Optional Solar Panel</h2>
<p>Then when the power station itself needs a recharge, it can be brought back up to at least 80% in just two and a half hours when plugged into the adapter that’s packaged with it. If you’re taking the power station on an extended getaway in the outdoors, you can also recharge it via solar energy. As an optional add-on, you can bundle your Anker 521 with a 100W solar panel. It can be adjusted to four different angles so you can maximize the energy it’s able to take in based on the sun’s position overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Anker 521, grabbing it for just $160.</a> If you choose to bundle with the solar panel, it’s 30% off from $499 which brings it to just $350.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an upcoming Daggerheart charity stream. The aptly named Critical Role TGIT stream is a charity event, featuring both a live auction event and a Daggerheart one-shot set in the radical 1990s.</p>

<h2>The Critical Role TGIT Stream Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official blog post, the Critical Role TGIT stream will go live on Thursday, September 18 on eBay Live, Twitch, YouTube, and the Critical Role streaming platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beacon</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=3zS1whLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=is2cqowM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The details on the post are scarce, but illustrative. The event will include Matt Mercer as the Gamemaster, Critical Role Foundation President and voice-actor Ashley Johnson, Will Friedle (<em>Batman Beyond</em>, <em>Boy Meets World</em>), Danielle Fishel (<em>Wizards Beyond Waverly Place</em>, <em>Shifting Gears</em>), Rider Strong (<em>Cabin Fever</em>), Jodie Sweetin (<em>Full House</em>), and Christine Lakin (<em>Step By Step</em>).</p>

<p>Those players will play a one-shot adventure using the blockbuster TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> set in a 90s-themed campaign frame. So get ready for Y2K anxiety, jnco jeans, neon, Tamagotchis,&nbsp; grunge music, and more. Given the actors at this table, expect a lot of cheeky references and inside jokes on top of these aesthetic trappings.</p>

<p>But this nostalgic time at the table is one part of the Critical Role TGIT stream. While the game is happening in real time, various pieces of Critical Role merchandise will be auctioned off through eBay Live. A portion of the proceeds will go to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT).</p>

<p>The NCWIT provides 1,600 universities, companies, non-profits, and government organizations with resources for recruiting, retaining, and advancing women through industry and entrepreneurial careers in computers and technology nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, some proceeds will go to the Critical Role Foundation's emergency relief fund. The Critical Role Foundation is a non-profit organization that partners with like-minded organizations to create grants. Those partners include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tonight-critical-role-asks-how-do-you-want-to-do-this-stephen-colbert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Nose Day</a>, Shanti Bhavan, and the First Nations Development Institute.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie is out April 2026 and it still doesn’t have an official title. Unofficially, however, the titles has seemingly leaked thanks to recently registered domain names, and all signs point to a riff on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476">Per Wario64</a>, the domain name supermariogalaxy.movie was registered by NBCUniversal earlier this month, followed by&nbsp;supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com on September 10. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">redirect to Universal’s homepage</a> and match up with the conventions used for the domains for the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EHknBYD082">https://t.co/EHknBYD082</a> (Super Mario Galaxy film) domain also registered by NBC Universal on Sept 3rd.</p> <p>For the first movie, Universal used <a href="https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS">https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS</a> for the movie's website (now points to VOD/Disc links since it's been out for years) <a href="https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI">https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/2uvjPnIwJQ">pic.twitter.com/2uvjPnIwJQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This backs up a leak from months ago when a photo of labels featuring the title <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> on Old Spice deodorant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/">started making the rounds online</a>. It wasn’t clear at the time if it was an elaborate fake or not, though the renders showing Yoshi and Luigi looked authentic. The latest information about the domain names suggests it was legit.</p>

 <p>“Can’t believe that the <em>Mario</em> movie sequence was leaked by an Old Spice merch, of all things,” the YouTube account NintendoFan <a href="https://x.com/NFan_Official/status/1966200638213337371">posted on X</a>. “What a crazy timeline! I loved Yoshi’s look on that little can. Now it’s just a matter of waiting to see it in 4K.”</p> <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ended with Bowser defeated and Mario and Luigi returning to their lives in Brooklyn while a post-credits sequent revealed a hatching Yoshi egg somewhere in the sewers. There weren’t any other strong leads on where the second movie would take things, but the apparent title suggests at the very least the gang is headed into space. Maybe to try and find a home for Yoshi?</p>

   <p>2007’s <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for the Wii sees the plumber hopping from planet to planet in order to free magical stars for Rosalina’s ship, called the Comet Observatory, which got messed up by Bowser. The game features a star character, Lumalee, who already appeared in the first movie. At the same time, <em>The Super </em><em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a reimagining of the series lore more than a remix of it, so <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will likely have its own twist on the elements of the game, if it borrows directly from them at all.</p> <p>One last thing worth noting is that the Old Spice art showed a Tostarenan from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> hanging behind Luigi. So whatever Nintendo and Minions studio Illumination Entertainment are planning, it’s likely much bigger than any one <em>Mario</em> game. The second movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 is out now on PC, and a number of issues have cropped up as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/" data-ref-id="1100-6534670">the game sets records on Steam</a>. On the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/44493923901971-Borderlands-4-PC-Troubleshooting-and-Optimization-Guide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands Support site</a>, Gearbox lays out some of the known issues so far and has provided workarounds for some issues.</p><h2>Compiling shaders</h2><p>To begin with, Gearbox reminded people that it's a good idea to ensure your drivers are updated, since doing that alone can fix some issues. For issues compiling shaders, Gearbox said they should take about 10 minutes to compile, and if it's taking longer, you can try rebooting the game and your system.</p><p>If that doesn't sort out the issue, you can clear the shader cache. Here's how:</p><ul><li>For Nvidia:  <ul><li>Open up the RunCommand (press WinKey+R),</li><li>Paste or type the following: %LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\DXCache and select "OK."  <ul><li>This will open a File Explorer window to that file path.</li></ul></li><li>Highlight all the files in the folder and select "Delete."</li><li>Some files cannot be deleted, so another window will appear to warn you.</li><li>Enable the "Do this for all current items" check box and then select "Skip." the files that cannot be deleted.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>For AMD:  <ul><li>Open AMD Adrenalin app</li><li>Select Gaming &gt; Graphics</li><li>Scroll down to bottom and select the Reset Shader Cache option</li><li>Note: This will wipe shaders for all programs</li></ul></li></ul><p>If you're running a 13th or 14th generation processor from Intel, that might be causing issues in your Borderlands 4 experience. Gearbox pointed out how Intel has acknowledged some instability issues, which can cause your PC to slow down, crash, overheat, or see large spikes of CPU usage. You can <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Mobile-and-Desktop-Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow Intel's instructions</a> to try to sort the issues out if you're experiencing them.</p><h2><strong>Troubleshooting tips</strong></h2><p>Gearbox also provided a rundown of general troubleshooting tips to help you on your way. These can be seen below, as written by the developer:</p><h3><strong>Verify Game Files - Corrupted or missing files can stop the game from launching</strong></h3><p><strong>Steam</strong></p><ol><li>Right-click Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Go to 'Properties' &gt; 'Installed Files'</li><li>Click 'Verify integrity of game files'</li></ol><p><strong>Epic</strong></p><ol><li>Find Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Click the three dots next to the game title</li><li>Choose ‘Manage’ and select 'Verify'</li></ol><h3>Disable Overlays - Game overlays can cause performance issues or crashes.</h3><ul><li>Disable Steam Overlay: Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game &gt; Uncheck "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game"</li><li>Turn off other overlays (e.g., Discord, GeForce Experience, MSI Afterburner)</li></ul><h3>Run as Administrator</h3><ol><li>Right-click the game’s shortcut or .exe file</li><li>Click "Run as administrator"</li></ol><p>Also, try running the game in "compatibility mode" for Windows 10 if you're using Windows</p><h3>Check Antivirus/Firewall - Some security software can block game files.</h3><ul><li>Add the game folder as an exception to your antivirus.</li><li>Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall to test if it’s the issue (be careful doing this).</li></ul><p>A <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/43238641357075-Borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">complete rundown of Borderlands 4's known issues on PC can be seen on the support website</a>. If you've exhausted Gearbox's list of troubleshooting techniques, you can <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">submit a support ticket</a>.</p><h2><strong>Missing Super Deluxe Edition DLC</strong></h2><p>The console edition of Borderlands 4, which doesn't unlock until later today, September 11, is encountering some problems already as well. Gearbox said Xbox Series X|S users who bought a physical copy of the Super Deluxe Edition are not going to see their promised DLC at launch. The developer said it's aware of the issue and is "working on getting players their bonus content."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a> scored the game a 7/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann has seemingly revealed that The Last of Us Part III is, at the very least, an idea that's been floated at the studio. In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>, Druckmann says Naughty Dog debated going straight into Part III after completing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">Part II</a>, but that ultimately, the team decided to move forward on what we now know as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While a Part III to The Last of Us seems like a no-brainer, considering how well this franchise does for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, Druckmann has given mixed signals over the years. When <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> dropped last year, it eventually included <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/grounded-ii-the-making-of-documentary-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-be-released"><em>Grounded II</em>, a documentary about the making of the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Near the end of it, Druckmann said, "For years now, I haven't been able to find that concept [for Part III], but recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have a conept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."&nbsp;</p><p>But then, in a March 2025 <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/"><em>Variety</em></a><em> </em>interview, Druckmann, when asked about a potential Part III, said, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't be on there being more of The Last of Us. This could be it."&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <em>Variety</em>, Druckmann has seemingly revealed that Naughty Dog, at one point, had plans regarding a Part III game in its Last of Us franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about potential Intergalactic sequels, Druckmann said, "We don't tend to plan too much in the future, because we find – and this is something I inherited, it's just the Naughty Dog culture – that we do our best work when it's something we're really excited about, really passionate about.</p><p>"Just to give you an example, when we finished The Last of Us Part II, and that was highly successful for us, we were debating whether we should just go straight into The Last of Us 3, and we had a really long period where we looked at ideas for maybe what could be in that game."&nbsp;</p><p>The team looked at Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, and its "sci-fi thing," though, and Druckmann said what is now Intergalactic is where the team's passion led it.&nbsp;</p><p>So for now, it sounds like a third Last of Us game is on the theoretical or potential table as Naughty Dog continues work on Intergalactic.&nbsp;</p>
