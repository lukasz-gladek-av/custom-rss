I’d typically avoid a decrease to damage, but the improved attack speed is worth it. </li><li>With the <strong>Viper’s Sting</strong> major Perk, hitting two consecutive scoped shots on a target will deal an extra 25 damage and reload two ammo. Keep your aim true and you’ll just keep getting your ammo back.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7800"><a id="bastion"></a>Bastion</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The biggest drawback to Bastion’s ultimate is that he’s left to be a sitting duck during it. <strong>Armored Artillery</strong> provides some flexibility by giving 300 temporary overhealth.</li><li><strong>Self-Repair</strong> brings back the identically-named ability from the original Overwatch, only now without a resource meter.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7801"><a id="cassidy"></a>Cassidy</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Quick Draw</strong> changes Cassidy’s Fan the Hammer ability from an automatic technique to a manually controlled one that can now land critical hits. This is the preferred Perk simply for being less situational than the other choice.</li><li>The <strong>Gun Slingin’</strong> major Perk reduces Combat Roll’s cooldown by three seconds for every critical hit you land with your primary fire. Reducing the cooldown by a minimum of half is a fantastic reward for landing a headshot.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7802"><a id="echo"></a>Echo</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Both of Echo’s minor Perks buff her ultimate, but <strong>Enhanced Duplication</strong> takes the cake by extending Duplicate’s duration by three seconds for the first clone ultimate you use.</li><li><strong>Full Salvo</strong> upgrades Sticky Bombs with 50-percent more projectiles at the cost of 15-percent less damage. It’s an overall damage increase and is arguably more useful than the other Perk.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7803"><a id="genji"></a>Genji</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon’s Thirst</strong> adds a 30-percent lifesteal ability to Genji’s ultimate, which greatly boosts your chances of survival.</li><li><strong>Meditation</strong> is another Perk that increases Genji’s sustainability. It regenerates 25 health per second while using Deflect.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7804"><a id="hanzo"></a>Hanzo</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Scatter Arrows</strong> enhances Hanzo’s Storm Arrows so that when they ricochet, they split into three new projectiles with two extra bounces each. This melds his original Scatter Arrow ability with Storm Arrows, and it’s awesome.</li><li>With <strong>Dragon Fury</strong>, hitting an enemy with your primary fire will increase your attack speed by 25-percent for one second. Keep getting hits and you can keep shooting fast.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7805"><a id="junkrat"></a>Junkrat</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Nitro Boost</strong> adds an optional boost ability for Junkrat’s RIP-Tire ultimate, albeit at the cost of 50-percent damage when used. Aside from reaching enemies faster, it’s much more useful than his other minor Perk.</li><li><strong>Frag Cannon</strong> is another handy Perk centered around speed, increasing Frag Launcher’s attack speed by 40-percent in exchange for one less ammo. Mid-range and closer fights are much easier when you don’t need to lead enemies as much.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7806"><a id="mei"></a>Mei</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Chilling Reach</strong> increases Mei’s primary fire range by 30-percent, but more importantly, it has more impact than the Permafrost Perk.</li><li>Nothing is worse than being surrounded while using the Cryo-Freeze ability. With the <strong>Cryo-Storm</strong> Perk, nearby enemies will be slowed and take a whopping 70 damage per second. Adding an offensive element to a healing ability that leaves you invulnerable is a must-pick.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7807"><a id="pharah"></a>Pharah</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Nothing encapsulates my time playing Pharah more than getting killed midway through her ultimate. <strong>Drift Thrusters</strong> immensely improve her ultimate with the simple addition of being able to move.</li><li><strong>Fuel Stores</strong> modifies Jet Dash to grant 50-percent fuel and increase maximum overfuel by 100-percent. This provides another handy choice for keeping your fuel reserves up.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7808"><a id="reaper"></a>Reaper</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Soul Reaving</strong> is another powerful Perk that brings back an older character mechanic. More specifically, eliminated enemies drop Soul Globes that restore 50 health.</li><li><strong>Dire Triggers</strong> gives Reaper a long-range option for his shotguns, letting you contribute from a distance or finish off any fleeing enemies.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7809"><a id="sojourn"></a>Sojourn</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Sojourn’s ammo cap adds 15 more bullets with the <strong>Extended Mag</strong> Perk. Having a full second more of shooting is great for your damage.</li><li>Dissruptor Shot can inflict 320 total damage if an enemy stays within its area-of-effect (AoE). <strong>Adhesive Siphon</strong> practically guarantees that damage by letting it stick to enemies and generating Railgun energy too.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7810"><a id="76"></a>Soldier: 76</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Field Emergency</strong> is perfect for intense moments as it doubles Biotic Field’s healing for critical health allies. Yes, that includes yourself as well.</li><li><strong>Agility Training</strong> is the ideal Perk if repositioning and diving into firefights is your game. It increases Sprint’s speed by 20-percent and also lets you reload while sprinting.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7811"><a id="sombra"></a>Sombra</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Translocator is often used when your health is low during a dicey fight. <strong>CTRL ALT ESC</strong> is ideal for those moments, initiating health regeneration when teleporting at critical health.</li><li><strong>White Hat</strong> lets you hack allies to restore 100 health over two seconds. This is a great use of Hack during non-combative moments or if you notice someone in dire need of healing.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7812"><a id="symmetra"></a>Symmetra</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Sentry Capacity</strong> gives Symmetra an extra Sentry Turret to place. It’s not as bad as the six-sentry “car wash” from many years ago, but the enemy team certainly won’t be happy. </li><li><strong>Perfect Alignment</strong> increases the primary fire range by 15-percent with each charge level, making it easy to finish off fleeing targets.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7813"><a id="torbjorn"></a>Torbjorn</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Fully Loaded</strong> maxes out your ammo upon activating Overload, so you’re always ready to dish out damage. This has much more consistent use than the other Perk.</li><li><strong>Anchor Bolts</strong> lets you deploy your turret 50-percent farther and, more importantly, attach it to walls and ceilings. The creative opportunities alone make this the better choice.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7814"><a id="tracer"></a>Tracer</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Zipping around the map for healing can be a common Tracer occurrence. With <strong>Blink Packs</strong>, you’ll gain a Blink charge from health packs for your troubles.</li><li>Keeping up with the Blink-related Perks to help you stay alive and elusive, the <strong>Flashback</strong> Perk upgrades Recall to restore all three Blink charges.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7815"><a id="venture"></a>Venture</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Excavation Exhilaration</strong> makes it so that your ability cooldowns are three times quicker while using Venture’s ultimate.</li><li><strong>SMART-R Excavator</strong> buffs the range of Venture’s primary fire by 25-percent, allowing for longer shots to be made.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="h7816"><a id="widowmaker"></a>Widowmaker</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>With the <strong>Scoped Efficiency</strong> Perk, a scoped shot only costs three ammo instead of five. Needing to reload less is a major help.</li><li><strong>Deadly Deux</strong> increases Venom Mine damage by 50-percent and lets you throw out two of them. An enemy triggering both at once would take the same amount of damage, but this lets you cover multiple exits and be generally more aggressive with the mines.</li></ul><hr><p>While these are the most consistently helpful choices, the alternatives are plenty viable for the right situations. Try being familiar with all of them so you’re ready to adapt for the team.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Other retailers indicate a date of April 30. Meanwhile, it seems controllers and other accessories will be available to pre-order on April 30 across the board. </p><p>My assumption is that the April 21 date is old and no longer the plan. The fact that hardware will reportedly be available to pre-order on the 30th and that some retailers are supposedly going to offer console pre-orders on that same day seems to point to April 30, about two weeks from now, being the day when people in the U.S. will be able to start pre-ordering the Switch 2 console and controllers. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if these dates are real. I assume Nintendo will be sharing official details later this week if we really are getting pre-orders on April 23 in Canada.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Devolver Digital has released its latest annual investor report, and included in the document is some commentary surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://investors.devolverdigital.com/files/downloads-and-publications/DEVO-FY24-Investor-Presentation.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devolver said</a> the original Switch is the company's most popular console platform, with more than 9 million units sold of its various games (<a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/47478-devolver-digital-s-games-are-most-successful-on-switch-selling-over-9-million-copies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GoNintendo</a>). Given that, Devolver said it sees an "opportunity" with the Switch 2. The company also called out how the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Direct</a> event featured three Devolver games: Starseeker, Human Fall Flat 2, and Enter the Gungeon 2.</p><p>Some of Devolver's games that have come to Switch over the years have included Hotline Miami, Always Sometimes Monsters, The Talos Principle, Reigns: Three Kingdoms, and The Plucky Squire.</p><p>The Switch 2 is set for release on June 5. Many are wondering if Nintendo will raise the price of the console due to Trump's controversial tariffs, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Switch 2 preorders were supposed to open on April 9, but Nintendo delayed them due to the tariffs. The company has yet to confirm a new start-date for preorders in the US, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">it could be soon. </a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">GameSpot's hands-on preview of the Switch 2</a> and its marquee launch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Over a year after its August 2023 launch date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is still being updated, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-massive-patch-8-update-is-coming-april-15-with-12-new-subclasses/1100-6530820/">its latest (and last major) patch</a> is one of its biggest--and arguably best--updates yet. Patch 8 is live now on all platforms, and introduces several long-awaited features to the game, including cross-platform play, photo mode, and a total of 12 new subclasses to give players more room to tinker with their Tav's build.</p><p dir="ltr">The excitement around photo mode is pretty self-explanatory--with a game as visually stunning as Baldur's Gate 3, it seemed almost criminal to launch the game with no photo mode. But the days of awkwardly trying to snap a good shot mid-cutscene are over. Now, players can take a photo at any time, even during combat. Larian even celebrated the patch's release with an animated (and fully voiced) short featuring all of the game's companion characters, along with an animated version of Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To activate photo mode, press F9 (PC) or press L3 + R3 at the same time (console). This will pause the game and bring up the photo mode menu, where players can change which characters are visible, choose from a number of facial expressions and body poses, add filters and frames, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">As for cross-play, players can now start up a multiplayer campaign with other players, regardless of what platform they're playing on. Players intending to use mods in a cross-play multiplayer campaign will want to make sure all players in the party have the same mods installed, but otherwise, there are no restrictions. (Though it's worth keeping in mind that some mods may be temporarily broken after the update, and will need to be deactivated until their creators update them to be compatible with Patch 8.)</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the game's 12 new subclasses, there's truly something for everyone, as each major class now has one additional subclass to choose from. Players that have already chosen a subclass can always hit up Withers to respec and choose a new one. The new subclasses are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barbarian:</strong> Path of Giants</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bard:</strong> College of Glamour</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cleric:</strong> Death Domain</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Druid:</strong> Circle of Stars</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fighter:</strong> Arcane Archer</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Monk:</strong> Drunken Master</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Paladin:</strong> Oath of the Crown</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ranger:</strong> Swarmkeeper</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rogue:</strong> Swashbuckler</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Shadow Magic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warlock:</strong> Hexblade</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wizard:</strong> Bladesinger</li></ul><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138" rel="nofollow ">Larian's blog post</a> detailing the patch's contents, Patch 8 will be the last major update to Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p dir="ltr">"Outside of minor bug fixing, Patch 8 will be the last game patch to introduce new content," the post reads. "That means we won't be adding any new narrative content or significant changes to storylines, Origin characters, or companions. We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we’re continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the start, your feedback has been incredibly important to us, and will continue to shape our future projects. As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project.</p><p dir="ltr">"From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-baldurs-gate-3-patch-improves-kissing/1100-6520967/">new ways to make out</a> with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes/2900-5753/">your most evil runs</a>, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the game's final update are listed in full below.</p><h2>Patch #8 Notes:</h2><p>Along with the new additions, Patch 8 also tackles a range of bugs, like fixing Shadowheart’s penchant for hair dye while skinny dipping, Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region, and we’ve resolved an issue with the moving platform in the Gauntlet of Shar that has accidentally proven harder to survive than, well, the actual Gauntlet of Shar.</p><p><em><strong>SPOILERS - Please bear in mind some of the entries below might contain spoilers, proceed at your own risk</strong></em></p><h2>HIGHLIGHTS</h2><ul><li>Photo Mode</li><li>12 brand new subclasses – one for each class, including: Path of the Giant Barbarian, College of Glamour Bard, Death Domain Cleric, Circle of Stars Druid, Arcane Archer Fighter, Way of the Drunken Master Monk, Oath of the Crown Paladin, Swarmkeeper Ranger, Swashbuckler Rogue, Shadow Magic Sorcerer, Hexblade Warlock, and Bladesinging Wizard</li><li>Cross-play</li><li>Xbox Series S split screen</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.</li><li>Fixed an issue where picking up items from the ground in multiplayer could then block movement via the controller stick.</li><li>Fixed the Wild Shape: Panther's Prowl action and Prowling condition not working correctly.</li><li>When you succeed a Perception check, the spotted item will now ping on the minimap and be listed in the combat log.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the special abilities of some of your allies weren't properly provided at the end of the dialogue with them at High Hall.</li><li>Scrolls and potions inside unlocked containers in your party inventory can now be used when rolling in dialogues.</li><li>Neutral and friendly NPCs will no longer become hostile when, outside of combat, they walk into surfaces created during combat that trigger passives (like electrified surfaces triggering Thunderbolt Strike).

This fix prevents the bug from happening in new playthroughs.</li><li>Fixed a bug where if you killed Gekh, then used Glut's Animating Spores to resurrect him, then dismissed Glut, both Spore Servant Gekh and Glut could become hostile towards you. It would also cause Gekh to try to stop you from using the raft to cross the lake.</li><li>Fixed multiple Oath of Vengeance dialogue options not appearing in Act I dialogues.</li><li>Fixed a bug allowing Glut to travel outside the Underdark if you used a waypoint from within the camp.

		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that the Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 hardcore mode is now available, with this mode adding new features to the game along with upping the difficulty. In the first game, things like the compass were removed to make navigation more immersive but in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s hardcore mode Warhorse Studios has gone further.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ynJN-HejlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We only kept a couple of the first game’s perks, and then we made new ones to provide a completely new challenge. It’s not just about making the game harder either, it’s about making it more immersive too. “</em><em>In the first game’s Hardcore Mode, we did things like disabling your map position and removing the compass, but we’ve gone further this time. We’ve added the option to ask different NPCs about your location in the world, which is something more immersive. You can run into travellers on the road and ask for directions,”&nbsp;</em>said Karel Kolmann, the senior game designer at Warhorse Studios.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will have to select at least three permanent negative traits at the start of the game, with some of those including Bad Back, Somnambulant, and Hangry Henry. Bad Back reduces the amount of weight you can carry, Somnanbulant makes you sleep walk and wake up in random locations, and Hangry Henry makes you want more food than usual.</p>


<p>In our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, Gareth said, <em>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 continues to fulfil the uncompromising vision of the first game. It weaves together a world of lords, knights, peasants and bandits in medieval Europe, with poor Henry of Skalitz caught somewhere in the middle just trying to cope. It’s grand in scale whilst being full of fine details and it sometimes gets in its own way a little bit, but if this is your kind of game it’ll be one that you don’t want to end because there’s nothing else quite like it.”</em></p>

Rarely do these sets start from the extreme basics for players or a group of players who are entirely new to the roleplaying experience, and this is where Steamforged Games and Kobold Press have stepped up and produced the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set. In this article, we'll have a look at who this set is for, what it contains, and what it's like.</p>

<p>While this is our first foray into Kobold Press' <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> system, we've been covering Steamforged Games' roleplaying boxed sets for a while, from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/epic-encounters-preview" rel="nofollow">very first Epic Encounters boxed sets</a>, up to the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories" rel="nofollow">Local Legends</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow">Palace of the Drow Queen</a>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set takes you from zero understanding of rolepalying games, up to and through your first few adventures, building up your confidence as a player, or Games Master (depending on which role you see yourself playing), along with introducing you to the <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> system and setting.</p>

<p>This introductory journey takes place across 4 books that delightfully draw you in and explain step by step how to play. Most beginner roleplayers usually start their journey by joining a group with an experienced GM, who guides them through their first few adventures, but it's easy to forget how daunting it can be for a new player joining an established group, or take for granted with the abundance of digitals tool there are for running games now that it's not always possible or appealing for new players. But this boxed set allows a group of entirely new players to take the journey together, with the GM working through the books first before the players join in (this is also good practice for the person taking on the GM role, as they will always have to do preparation before running the adventure).</p>

<p>The first book in the box, Welcome to Roleplaying Games, is a primer for roleplaying games in general, taking players through the basics of terms, giving an example of a roleplaying game, and some great tips on how to be a good player and GM. Players then move on to the second book, Introductory Adventures, which takes a solo gamer through their first adventure, allowing the GM to play through an adventure, familiarise themselves with the introductory rules, and the flow of a game, before moving on to the 2 adventures they'll run for players.</p>

<p>While working through the Introductory Adventures, GMs have access to the Rules Reference Book, which acts like a mini Players Guide (a book you can pick up later to expand your games) and builds upon the details in clear terms, those introduced in the adventures, so if something comes up that players want to do, you can easily find the rule that covers it and continue the flow of the game. Finally, the Advanced Adventures book contains 2 further adventures that add extra elements the GM will need to manage and more advanced rules for the players.</p>

<p>The books in the starter set are just part of the experience. The <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set also includes other components to make your first games much easier. The set includes 4 pre-generated character sheets (5 if you include the one used for the solo adventure), with all the stats required to play them, and level them up after each of the adventures. 3 of these characters are actually available for free on the <a href="https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/the-valiant-six-pregen-character-sheets-pdf/" rel="nofollow">Kobold Press site</a> (along with 3 others) and Cannit Cragwalker, the Beastkin, is brand new for this set.</p>

<p>These 4 characters offer a great introduction for first-time players and include a fighter, barbarian, wizard, and warlock, a nice balance of magic and combat prowess. For those who might have some experience with roleplaying, it's noticeably lacking a healer or a rogue, but this seems like a conscious choice because of the complexity of those types of characters (in play-style and motivations).</p>

<p>Each of the characters also has a miniature to use on the included game maps, of which there are 2 double-sided maps (1 for each adventure), a set of dice, and tokens for the monsters. It's all kept in a tidy, compact box that makes transporting it convenient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rules system that <em>Tales of the Valinant</em> uses is the <a href="https://koboldpress.com/black-flag-roleplaying/" rel="nofollow">Black Flag Roleplaying</a> system, which works seamlessly with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition</a> system. The starter set works as the perfect jumping on point for any roleplay system (although you may have to learn some new rules and mechanics for a different system), and I think it speaks volumes that SFG and Kobold Press haven't used this to push their own system. There's a leaflet for the 3 <em>Tales of the Valiant </em>books (Player's Guide, Game Master's Guide and Monster Vault) to show you where you can go next, but nothing is pushed on players. The adventure isn't left on a hook (although some continuation ideas are provided), but it feels like a standalone box, and a powerful one at that.</p>

<p>I really hope that this box is a huge success, and following SFG's <em>Epic Encounters</em> style boxes, we get adds ons for it with new characters and new adventures.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Tales Of The Valiant Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The T<em>ales of the Valiant</em> Starter Set is the perfect combination of roleplaying introduction, great adventure (which we didn't go into too much detail on to avoid spoilers), and solid components, all in an awesome compact box. The set works extremely well for players who are brand new to roleplaying or those who want to try being a Game Master for the first time. If everyone in your group is super experienced, then it's still a nice set to play through, but the adventure might not be challenging for experienced players. I really hope SFG picks this up as part of their <em>Epic Encounters</em> style boxes and expands further.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/g-rebels-is-a-sci-fi-flight-combat-game-where-you-feel-like-youre-flying-a-nissan-versa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been patrolling the skies and shooting down hostile aircraft in flight sims since the 1980s, all the way back to blazing away at single green pixels in the original Sublogic Flight Simulator for Apple II. Since then, I’ve whipped the Kilrathi aboard the Tiger Claw, crushed the Rebellion in TIE Fighter, gunned down the Red Baron in, well, The Red Baron, and buzzed my own apartment in Microsoft Flight Simulator. So I was pretty tickled by the opportunity to spend several hours with G-Rebels, an in-development game that combines several things I dearly love: aviation, Blade Runner, and open-ended approaches to gameplay. This amalgam of design influences produces something that is curious, ambitious, and dripping with potential, but which I’m not sure has yet been tuned enough to find its footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels is set after a climate disaster wipes out most of the world. You’re now a member of one of many factions piloting armed aircraft called Skyblades between the skyscrapers of what appears to be off-brand Blade Runner LA. You search the air for enemies, traffickers, and rogue replicants. Yes, they’re actually called replicants... I’m no expert on copyright law so don’t ask me how. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">G-Rebels Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, vehicle-oriented games have to fulfill a very specific requirement to succeed: the vehicle has to be fun to pilot through the environments provided. And that’s where the problems begin for G-Rebels: flying around is more often a chore than a thrill. Sometimes, it’s even a bore.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels refers to your Skyblade as a glider, but that description isn’t really accurate. Its closest real-world analog is a helicopter, as you have the ability to hover in place practically anywhere. But unlike a real chopper, there’s no constant dance of hands and feet necessary on the part of the pilot to keep things stable most of the time. Only cornering or changing altitude rapidly puts much strain on the pilot. Instead, your Skyblade effortlessly hovers, scoots, and strafes up, down, and side to side like some flying first-person shooter avatar. If you’ve ever played the ancient FPS Descent, things will feel eerily familiar.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your Skyblade has the handling characteristics of a sci-fi Nissan Versa.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet it takes a long time to get a real hang of the X-Type Skyblade, weirdly because it is such a forgiving vehicle. Compared to a flight sim or even an arcade shooter like Star Wars Squadrons, there’s very little sense of momentum or gravity at work. You can stop and shift your velocity from forward to straight upward in a second, but everything feels weirdly underpowered. Your Skyblade has the handling characteristics of a sci-fi Nissan Versa: slow, reliable, predictable, anemic, and utterly boring. I already drive a Nissan Versa in real life, and I don’t need to carry its steady, value-conscious banality into my fantasy worlds. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upgrades help somewhat, especially in regard to the punch of your guns and your straight line speed, though I still felt like I was merely updating my flying sedan into a flying minivan. In the end, the problem with G-Rebels is that while the vehicle style fits the Blade Runner aesthetic, the controls and capabilities are a bad match for the near-constant canyon flying. More consideration needs to be given to proximity warnings and spatial awareness, a problem compounded by the mission design. The campaign is quite simply front-loaded with escort duties and timed waypoint challenges, anachronistic designs that sap much of the richness from the environment.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels takes place above a flooded world where skyscrapers rise from synthetic islands and inhabit the narrow space between thundering waves and near-persistent clouds. Within that space hover other Skyblades – some benign, others piloted by nefarious foes. Mission design is pretty straightforward: go to waypoints, look around, find targets, and blow them up without dying yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a story, a plot, characters and such, but not a lot that I cared about. Voice acting was hammily scripted and badly delivered, and the tones of other pilots had a soulless ring to them that led me to believe they were likely AI generated... which a look at the Steam page appeared to confirm. That’s deeply disappointing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I shouldn’t go much further talking about G-Rebels without pointing out its greatest sin: the presence of tightly-timed waypoint-to-waypoint-to-waypoint dashes. I thought that we as a species had collectively agreed to discontinue these terrible sections in games after Superman 64, but apparently G-Rebels’s developers disagreed. Why anyone thinks sprinting to five waypoints over and over in a fairly graceless vehicle that I’m just learning to fly is a good gameplay experience is beyond me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What doesn’t disappoint is the gunplay, which feels like one of the most-realized aspects of G-Rebels. Fans of flight sims and arcade flight shooters are going to be pretty familiar with the base modes available: a short range gun mode useful for dogfighting, and a much longer range guided missile system capable of hitting targets from vast distances with an electronic lock-on. Both are thoughtfully designed. I found that following my brain’s now near-instinctual flight-sim programming worked very well. Slightly leading turning targets at close range usually ended in solid hits. and adjusting my lead at distance worked just as it should. The missiles were potent, but the guns were so much fun I largely stuck to them, poking in and out from behind the megalithic buildings to snipe. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your control panels and HUD are a triumph of form over function. Dashboard screens can make the relative positions and altitudes confusing, and seem to alternate between providing too little or too much information. Instrumentation feels like it was designed more to create pretty preview captures than to quickly provide the info a pilot might need when flying an antigravity tank between tall buildings in a thunderstorm. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What doesn’t disappoint is the gunplay, which feels like one of the most-realized aspects of G-Rebels. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't get a lot of the conventional dogtails and energy tactics you’d expect from a flight game set inside a planetary atmosphere. Gravity really isn’t much of a factor, so dogfights are less chases and jousts than shootouts between flying tanks. There are strategies to learn and employ, but most of what you’ve learnt in other flying games doesn’t really apply here. Usually, shooting first and fastest is the best guarantee of victory.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The city itself has potential, but in its present form largely fails to deliver anything especially characteristic. The buildings are decently-rendered enough, but very little of what you see really feels distinct, much less lived-in or real. It feels more like a set or a stage made for a video game than any real living, breathing world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">G-Rebels might become something really entertaining, but right now it's still very much a work in progress. It’s cool, but it’s not yet consistently fun. Missions and aircraft handling design have a long way to go before it hits that. You can see the potential for something enjoyable, but the parts haven’t quite come together yet into a compelling formula. I haven’t yet seen an official release date for G-Rebels, but I’m hoping it’s far enough out that the team has time to refine its ambitions and create the carefully-tuned flight combat experience they’re so obviously lovingly laboring to realize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty is a former IGN editor who likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

Among the negative effects are Sweaty, which makes Henry smell worse when he goes without showering, Bashful, which removes the ability to ask villagers for directions, and Somnambulant, which turns Henry into a sleepwalker--whenever he lays down to rest, he can wake up in a completely different place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477030" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477030"></a><figcaption>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4477030-kcd-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.4.2 also adds multiple fixes and rebalances to the non-Hardcore experience as well, including rebalanced prices on herbs, a new hairstyle for Henry, and fixed save-file issues for Xbox players specifically. The full Patch 1.4.2 notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launched February 4 to critical acclaim, as it currently <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">averages an 88 overall</a> on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/">GameSpot's 9/10 review</a> called it "utterly enticing," and described it as "a rich and sprawling adventure that effortlessly oscillates between medieval drama and slice-of-life hijinks in a world that feels distinctly alive."</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Patch 1.4.2 notes</h2><h3 dir="ltr">New</h3><h4 dir="ltr">Hardcore Mode</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Introduced the option to start a new playthrough in hardcore mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-squad-no-more-room-in-hell-2-and-exfil-now-support-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Along with the unveiling of NVIDIA's GeForce <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16-gb-429-8-gb-379-20-percent-faster-4060-ti-2x-dlss-4/">RTX 5060Ti</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-8-gb-sweet-spot-gaming-299-over-100-fps-games-1080p/">RTX 5060</a>, we also got the announcement of the next four games that have added support for DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Offworld Industries' <a href="https://wccftech.com/squad-44-is-post-scriptums-new-name-update-adds-greek-faction-new-map-and-weapons/">SQUAD</a>, Misultin Studios and MicroProse Software's EXFIL and Torn Banner Studios' <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-update-in-2025-for-no-more-room-in-hell-2-released-adding-firefighter-zombies/">No More Room In Hell 2</a> join the ranks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-available-in-warhammer-40k-darktide-enlisted-and-karma-the-dark-world/">games</a> like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/">Control</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a> in supporting DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-black-myth-wukong/">blog post</a> from NVIDIA, each game enjoys a performance boost, but the biggest headway seems to be made in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>
<p>Players pushing 4K, with everything maxed out, while utilizing an RTX 50 series GPU "<em>can multiply performance up to 10X thanks to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution,</em>" NVIDIA claims.</p>
<p>"<em>At 4K, with full ray tracing enabled and every other setting maxed out, DLSS Multi Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution multiply frame rates by an average of 10X. This massive performance boost enables GeForce RTX 5070 gamers to play at over 110 FPS, GeForce RTX 5070 Ti users to play at over 130 FPS, GeForce RTX 5080 owners to play at over 150 FPS, and GeForce RTX 5090 buyers to play at over 240 FPS, maxing out the capabilities of the latest 4K OLED G-SYNC compatible DisplayPort 2.1 displays.</em>"</p>
<p>Of course, the performance boost you're able to see will always depend on the hardware you have in your system, but even considering that, it's still an impressive bump for what many players find challenging to run.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was one of the biggest titles in 2024, winning its fair share of awards, including the game of the year for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Golden Joysticks</a>. It's also one of the sleekest-looking games in recent years if you've got the hardware for it. Now that it supports DLSS 4 Multi-Frame generation, more players will be able to enjoy its wonderful visuals without losing frames as they would have before.</p>

Dear reader, allow me, if you will, a moment of honesty. I truly, wholly did not know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> was still going. Not only is it still going, but yesterday <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> shared a look at the game's impending second year of updates, so I really missed the boat on this one - pun intended, of course. The first season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">pirate</a> game's second year has already kicked off, introducing a few new features.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters there's new world tiers, which are basically just optional difficult levels you can choose for certain challenges. Pick a higher tier, get better rewards, simple! There's item ascension now too, which lets you improve your gear with things like randomized buffs and "modifiable slots." Season 1 will be getting a mid-season update too that'll bring in a new PvP feature called Death Tides, essentially a capture and control kind of mode.

Season 2, which will arrive sometime this summer, will be bringing in playable large ships, but more notably, there'll be factions to choose from each of which have their own boons. Other factions will be hostile to you though, so take that into consideration. After that there's season 3 in the fall, with its biggest addition being land combat. Feels like something you'd think would be there from day one, but we all know how rocky a development period Skull and Bones has had.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, there's season 4, which is quite literally adding in a kraken. It's a pirate game! Of course you have to have a kraken. Outside of that there's the addition of the Hunters Guild, you won't be surprised to hear that it focuses on hunting sea creatures, and there'll be a new large ship to be acquired too.
</p>
<p>
If the fact that Skull and Bones is continuing to receive updates has convinced you to give it a go, perhaps hold off on buying it, as the game is getting a free weekend this week, from April 17th-21st. Can't say I saw this game lasting longer than a year, so kudos to the devs for keeping things ship shape - pun intended, of course.
