            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-capsule-review-microphone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been using the NZXT Capsule for a few weeks and have finally pulled together enough experience with it to assemble a full review. I picked it up from NZXT with open expectations after moving across from the HyperX Quadcast, which had been a capable microphone for me for four years.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if the low price point was representative of the quality of the NZXT Capsule, but now I believe that the company isn’t charging enough for his stellar peripheral. </p>



<p>Read on to check out this full NZXT Capsule review before you buy the microphone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seriously-heavy-stuff">Seriously Heavy Stuff</h2>



<p>The NZXT Capsule is a cardioid-based USB microphone designed to stand upright on a desk or attach to a boom arm – which NZXT also sells. At just $59.99, the NZXT Capsule is one of the most affordable microphones on the market, coming in at less than half the price of the HyperX Quadcast S.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the NZXT Capsule looks <strong>very </strong>attractive. It’s available in either solid white or solid black, and everything from the build of the base unit itself to the uncompromising, shock-resistant desk stand feels premium. It has a nice braided cable in the box and a few adapters, just in case you want to mount it to a boom arm.</p>



<p>One of the things that surprised me the most was the weight of the microphone with the desk stand attached – it’s <strong>heavy</strong>. That translates nicely into a more ‘expensive feel’ for the unit, which is made of tough, resilient plastic and aluminium. On the face of the microphone sits two dials, one to control the voice volume and another to control the volume of a headset.</p>



<p>That second dial is important, as it leans into another feature – you can run a headset <strong>through </strong>the NZXT Capsule.</p>



<p>With a quick-release implementation, solid cardioid microphone pattern, and crystal-clear audio capabilities, the NZXT Capsule could be the Quadcast killer we’ve been waiting for. On stream, my viewers noted that it sounds much better than the Quadcast, and the built-in shielding does a stronger job of masking background noise.</p>



<p>I can’t find much of a fault with <a href="https://nzxt.com/en-GB/product/capsule#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the NZXT Capsule</a>. I was going to suggest that it’s perhaps <strong>too big</strong>, but there’s a Mini version available if you’re limited on space. I can wholeheartedly recommend giving the NZXT Capsule a shot if you’re a streamer looking for a solid microphone.</p>



<p>You’d hardly believe it has been on the market since September 2021 – it’s brilliant.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zotac Gaming Zone Handheld Available to Preorder Now]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-available-to-preorder-now.956463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zotac Gaming is the latest hardware manufacturer to break into the handheld gaming market. It has just been revealed that the ‘Zotac Gaming Zone’ is available to preorder. Zotac unveiled the Zone at Computex 2024 in June, announcing its intention to enter the growing handheld gaming race.</p>



<p>This means that the Zotac Gaming Zone will start to compete with the likes of the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, Steam Deck, and MSI Claw.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation">Next Generation</h2>



<p>The Zotac Gaming Zone is a fine contender compared to the current market leaders. It boasts an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U with RDNA 3 graphics and Zen 4 architecture for maximum gaming power. It enters the running with 16 GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM, which means it’s half as capable in that respect as the ROG Ally X released just weeks ago.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the Zotac Gaming Zone features a full HD AMOLED display, which is the best screen currently available in the realm of handhelds. It will be capable of putting out a 120Hz refresh rate and is rated at 800nits of brightness, which edges out the ROG Ally X and the new MSI Claw.</p>



<p>It’s perhaps restricted slightly by the 512 GB NVMe SSD, but it does have a UHS-II microSD card reader for expansions.</p>



<p>Perhaps where the Zotac Gaming Zone shines the brightest is in the overall build of the unit and the controls. It features a few innovations that are sure to make it stand out among the competition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drift-resistant analog sticks</li>



<li>Hall-effect triggers with two-stage adjustment</li>



<li>Radial dials around the sticks for on-the-fly tweaking</li>



<li>Dual trackpads (like the Steam Deck)</li>



<li>Dual USB ports rated for rapid charging</li>



<li>Front-facing camera and onboard microphone</li>
</ul>



<p>All that and it also has a touch of RGB to really impress the gamer in you.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed how much the Zotac Gaming Zone will cost, but it’s expected to retail for around $800. It was recently announced that the Zone will be playable at Gamescom, so we’ll be hands-on with the device later this week.</p>

They have a secret—in this school, there is a war that only they’re able to fight in. It is called the “Suuransen (Number War).” Since the olden days, this periodically-fought war has been determining the rankings of the Suuke, as well as selecting a “Soyogi” who leads and controls the Suuke. This war was thought to never take place again after one number broke away. However, since the sudden re-emergence of “the number that should not exist,” the conditions for the Suuransen to be held have now been met… “When the time comes in which the ten numbers assemble, The carved seal shall guide you to the field of battle.” Her name is Reisaki Hiroka. She is the one who signals the beginning and the end.

<p>EA FC 24 closed up its Esports World Cup tournament with an incredible performance by Luna Galaxy’s Jafonso, who managed to take home first place when competing against Tuzzy Esports’ Young.</p>



<p>With only one week left in the Esports World Cup, EA FC gave many fans the action they deserved. Some of the best players in the world joined the competition, pushing forward EA FC’s competitive esports future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-jafonso-takes-home-first-place-in-the-ea-fc-esports-world-cup">Jafonso Takes Home First Place In The EA FC Esports World Cup</h2>



<p>With Week 7 coming to an end, many games saw their Grandfinals take place. Among those was EA FC 2024’s. The popular soccer game had teams such as Cloud9, Team Liquid, Tuzzy Esports, Luna Galaxy and more competing. </p>



<p>Competitors from all over the globe had a chance to take a stab at qualifying for Grandfinals, but only two were able to make that happen.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a feverish battle, Jafonso managed to come in first during his semi-final match against Phzin. The competitor advanced to Grandfinals by only one point when the match ended 7-6.</p>



<p>On the other side of the competition, Young was able to secure his Grandfinals spot by beating Team Falcon’s Abumakkah, 7-2. Both matches had a time limit, which was the same for Grandfinals, where Jafonso and Young faced off against each other.</p>

<p>Both competitors brought their A-game to the Grandfinals, but only one was able to finish off victorious. Jafonso, the Portuguese player for Luna Galaxy, was able to secure first place with a 6-2 win.  </p>



<p>The Luna Galaxy player has had a handful of first-place titles, with the Esports World Cup 2024 being his biggest prize pool. Jafonso walked out of the tournament with $300,000 of prize winnings. Young, who claimed second, won $150,000. </p>

<p>Team Vitality has lifted the IEM Cologne trophy in the Cathedral of Counter-Strike, netting a $400,000 grand prize and earning qualification to both IEM Katowice <strong>and </strong>the BLAST Premier World Final. It’s a monumental moment for the team, as no player on the squad has won this trophy previously, despite some having made it to the grand finals before.</p>



<p>Vitality handed the final loss to Natus Vincere, who as recently as yesterday was speaking honestly and openly about the need to sharpen up if it was ever going to beat a dominant Vitality side.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-cathedral">In The Cathedral</h2>



<p>IEM Cologne is one of the most important and legendary events in the Counter-Strike esports calendar. This massive victory marks the first major win for Team Vitality in 2024, and it was achieved in a historic fashion. As Vitality carved through the group stage, it effortlessly powered past FURIA, FaZe, and MOUZ to qualify for the playoffs.</p>



<p>From there, the squad eliminated SAW from the tournament and then pulled off a 3-1 win over Natus Vincere, typically one of the most stalwart teams in the CS2 scene.</p>



<p>HLTV has mentioned that this is a competitor for the game of the year, with both teams putting on quite a show for the thousands of fans in attendance in Cologne. There was a special commendation handed to Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut, who clutched up for Vitality in numerous spots and managed to secure more than 100 kills throughout the series, earning him his 20th MVP award.</p>



<p>As the sun sets on IEM Cologne, esports fans can now look forward to IEM Rio 2024, which is the next event under this banner that’ll take place in October in Brazil. Elsewhere, we’ve still got the ESL Pro League Season 20, BLAST Premier Fall Final, Thunderpick World Championship, BLAST Premier: World Final, <strong>and </strong>Perfect World Shanghai to play out before the year wraps up.</p>

                <p>Video games have a rich and intriguing history in Japan, with many of the best games from the first four console generations hailing from Japanese studios such as Nintendo, Sega, and Capcom.

<p>This weekend, the best Call of Duty teams in the world descended upon Saudi Arabia to take part in the Esports World Cup. Over a four-day window, 16 squads took to a grand stage in Riyadh, with $1.8 million on the line, but following a dominating streak, it was Atlanta FaZe that secured the $600,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>It was a relatively surprising event all around. From Toronto Ultra being ejected from the playoffs by 100 Thieves to Cloud9 crumbling <strong>again </strong>against OpTic, this weekend proved to be just as exciting as one of the biggest events in the Call of Duty League calendar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-monumental-performance">Monumental Performance</h2>



<p>It wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but there’s no denying that the Esports World Cup has been exciting of late. This weekend, Modern Warfare 3 entered the limelight, with a range of CDL and Challengers-grade teams competing for a massive cash prize. As the group stage unravelled, eight teams fell at the first post:</p>



<ul>
<li>OMiT Brooklyn</li>



<li>Vegas Legion</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Stallions</li>



<li>Team Heretics</li>



<li>Lore Gaming</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>When the tournament progressed into the playoffs, <strong>only </strong>the CDL teams remained in the running, which made it feel like COD Champs all over again. Many thought OpTic Gaming would snatch the top spot after steamrolling over OMiT, Carolina Royal Ravens, and Cloud9, but Atlanta FaZe proved to be too powerful for the reigning world champions to overcome.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the grand final took place between Atlanta FaZe and 100 Thieves, represented by the LA Thieves squad. These teams hadn’t met at this point in a tournament for years, and the hype train was in full flow as the grand final kicked off. To get there, 100 Thieves had to eliminate Toronto Ultra and Vancouver Surge, and the squad entered the GF with immense momentum.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Atlanta FaZe’s respawn game was just too clean, with the team securing the first and second rounds of Hardpoint. Two huge map wins were landed by 100 Thieves in the first rounds of Control and Search, but yet another win from FaZe in the second Search seemed to all but seal the deal.</p>



<p>Going into the second round of Control, Atlanta FaZe maintained the pressure with a scoreline of 3 – 2 (in a best-of-seven), 100 Thieves put up one hell of a fight, but with FaZe dominating the round on Invasion with ease, it wasn’t long before the squad of Cellium, aBeZy, Simp, and Drazah was lifting the tournament trophy and celebrating a $600,000 win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-ps5-remake-is-expected-to-retail-at-60-consumers-will-have-to-pay-the-sony-tax/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming "remaster" version of Until Dawn will be released with a "pricey" tag, as a leak by Dealabs suggests that the title could be off to retail at $60.</p>
<p>For those unaware, a new PS5 version of Until Dawn is expected to hit stores in the upcoming months. The title won't have many changes in terms of the storyline, but the key differences would lie in the transition to the next-gen platform, ultimately enhancing the overall graphics and cinematics of the title. The developers have recreated the game in Unreal Engine 5 with the aim of giving players access to a more intimate experience throughout the unfolding horrific events.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credits: PlayStation</figcaption></figure>
<p>With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4/">recent emergence of the release date of the title</a> (on both PS5 and PC, where the game will make its debut), we now have an idea of the price point at which Until Dawn is expected to retail, credited to a leak by the famous whistleblower Billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-combien-coutera-la-version-amelioree-de-until-dawn-sur-ps5-et-pc-58568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dealabs</a>. Interestingly, a dedicated physical disk for the new title will also be released alongside, and in terms of pricing, here is how they will look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$59.99 for US Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>€69.99 For European Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>109.95 AUD For Australian Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>79.99 CAD For Canadian Markets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some PlayStation fans consider the pricing outrageous, given that other remaster counterparts, such as The Last of Us Part II, initially retailed at €49.99 on PS5, and the original version of the title is much cheaper nowadays. The pricing move will certainly raise questions about whether the newer Until Dawn will do any good for Sony in the markets. Despite the hype around the title, such high prices will certainly lower consumer enthusiasm, which can reflect poor sales.</p>
<p>Let us know your thoughts on Until Dawn's price model. Is it adequate, given the graphical improvements we are receiving?</p>

            <p>A new "modern camera" mod is now available for Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill 4: The Room on PC.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZealotTormunds">ZealotTormunds</a> has developed a mod that gives Silent Hill players both a first-person perspective and a more contemporary over-the-shoulder camera.</p>

<p>Both Silent Hill 3 and 4 typically use fixed camera angles. By freeing up these locked perspectives, Zealot provides players with the chance to get a closer look at the game's textures, enemies, and environments.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, getting the original Silent Hill 2, 3, and 4 on PC is neither easy nor cheap, but for those lucky enough to have them, this mod enables players to experience the horror in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>No, not all fans are <a href="https://x.com/denshirenji04/status/1823145054908600726">happy</a>, with some criticising the mod for stripping away the game's original intent. However, as Zealot said on X/Twitter, yes, "a huge part of Silent Hill's identity is its camera, but this is just a mod that lets you play differently".</p>
<p>"This is just a mod that lets you play differently, see the scenarios from a little closer and appreciate the art of the game," they added. "The original SH3 is still there, and you can play it as intended.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/alien-romulus-movie-review-timeline-reddit-4dx-1851625237<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good or bad taste is difficult to define, but easy to point out, and <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, from Uruguayan director Fede Álvarez (who famously delivered a fantastic <em>Evil Dead</em> flick over a decade ago), offers a bizarre mix of both. It’s clear that Álvarez wants to hearken back to the analog, tactile sci-fi vibes of the original <em>Alien</em> flicks, with plenty of satisfyingly twisty knobs and low-fi computer screens that will delight any old-school fan. And with a great, young cast that includes <em>Civil War</em>’s Cailee Spaeny and <em>The Last of Us’ </em>Isabela Merced, <em>Romulus</em> feels like it’s courting both the original <em>Alien</em> lovers and a younger, fresher group of potential fans. And it’s fast, too—the two-hour run-time flies by without any filler, and a perfectly paced build-up results in a third act that will have your heart pumping almost the entire time. </p><p>But the massive weak point in <em>Romulus</em>’ hull is its reliance on winks, nods, and nostalgia—including one poor-taste cameo that made me cringe every time the character was on-screen. Though I think any casual <em>Alien</em> fan will enjoy the film and miss many of the Easter eggs, there are some egregious references throughout that had my eyes rolling around in my head. Nostalgia is a helluva drug.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h157783"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Alien: Romulus</em> looks damn good</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1816995156798636209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1816995156798636209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Álvarez reportedly told</a></span> the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con crowd that seeing <em>Romulus</em> didn’t require prior knowledge of other <em>Alien</em> films, and that “member berries cannot be the full meal” (a reference to a<em> South Park</em> joke about nostalgia), but I’m not so sure that’s true. From the moment <em>Romulus</em> opens, there are references aplenty—the opening shot shows the wreckage of the Nostromo, the ship from the first film, floating in the empty vacuum of space, for Engineer’s sake.<br></p><p>Though after that, Álvarez swiftly (and smartly) turns the attention to <em>Alien: Romulus</em>’ cast of young adults, who live and work in a dreary, depressing mining colony called Jackson’s Star where it’s always raining and everyone is always sick. Rain Carradine (Spaeny) and her “brother” Andy (David Jonsson), a damaged Weyland-Yutani synthetic reprogrammed by Rain’s late father to protect her at all costs, live a life of indentured servitude—Rain is forced to work in the hopes that she’ll earn enough hours to leave Jackson’s Star and head to Yvaga II, a terraformed planet that’s less miserable.<br></p><p>After a Weyland-Yutani employee denies Rain’s request to go off-planet, she jumps at the chance to change her fate: A ragtag bunch of teenagers (and her friends) discover a “Weyu” ship drifting in the planet’s atmosphere, and they want to fly up and steal its crypods so they can venture out to Yvaga themselves. The problem? They need Andy, who can access all of the ship’s systems, even though his strange gait and stammer indicate that he isn’t in perfect working condition.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7bfaa1dd49cd0d757cdb63b3b50b1ef9" data-recommend-id="image://7bfaa1dd49cd0d757cdb63b3b50b1ef9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The alien sneers.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Andy and Rain’s relationship is the beating heart of <em>Romulus</em>, played to perfection by Spaeny and Jonsson—from the moment his big, sad eyes appear on screen, I know Andy is going to break my heart. Andy’s affinity for puns, which he struggles to get out due to his stammer, endears you to him within moments, and Rain’s good-natured annoyance at his bad jokes further defines their lovely relationship. <em>Romulus</em> tries to fill out the rest of its character tropes like previous <em>Alien</em> films, with a crass and rude British guy, his grim, no-nonsense partner, a kind-hearted heartthrob, and a sweet (and newly pregnant) best friend, and the young actors all play them well, even if their characters aren’t fully fleshed out. But Rain and Andy? I’d die for them.<br></p><p>Visually, <em>Romulus</em> is as close to perfect as a sci-fi horror flick can get. When the shuttle carrying the teens up to the derelict Weyu ship (which is actually a decommissioned outpost, and, as you might suspect, full of facehuggers) soars upward into the planet’s upper atmosphere, the visual effects dazzle: rain pelts the hull, lightning flashes all around it, and strange, red-orange veins of light run through the clouds. When it bursts through the cloud cover, Rain sees the planet’s sun for the first time ever, and I feel a similar stirring of awe in my gut.<br></p><p><em>Romulus</em> truly is beautiful, from the cinematography to the set design to the way the iconic xenomorphs look. Álvarez impressively and effectively plays with color, light, and texture (wispy gray smoke, white-hot steam, tar-black blood), and the pitch-perfect mix of practical and digital effects blends iconic <em>Alien</em> iconography with impressive, modern tech. And then there’s the digitally recreated elephant in the room.</p><h2 id="h157784"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Romulus </em>and references</strong></h2><p>As I mentioned, there are <em>a lot</em> of Easter eggs in <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. The decommissioned outpost (split into two massive sections called Remus and Romulus) is powered by a computer called MU/TH/UR 9000, a newer version of the one running the Nostromo in 1979’s <em>Alien</em>. When one of the motley crew members bullies and denigrates Andy, he stammers back a quote from <em>Aliens</em>, saying he prefers the term “artificial human” just like Bishop told Ripley back then. The outpost’s door mechanisms are the same ones from 2014 survival horror game <em>Alien: Isolation</em>. Hell, even the original xenomorph, the one Ripley blows out of the Nostromo airlock, haunts <em>Romulus</em>—its corpse is suspended from the ceiling in the derelict ship, its acid blood having burnt through several floors and destroyed the place.<br></p><p>But the most egregious Easter egg is a rotten one: a digitally recreated Ian Holm, who played a secret synthetic in the original film that was placed on the Nostromo by Weyland-Yutani to help further the company’s attempts to secure humanity’s fate in the stars by any means necessary. The digital avatar of Holm, who passed away in 2020, looks bad and uncanny almost every time it’s on screen, and the fact that the damaged robot (who goes by Rook in <em>Romulus</em>) is just a torso perpetually leaking the synthetic’s iconic white diagnostic fluid makes it even worse. His appearance is so bizarre and unnecessary (and so prevalent, as Rook has a ton of screen time), that it sours so much of what makes <em>Romulus</em> enjoyable. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-recommend-id="image://81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-recommend-id="image://81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From the moment Rook is introduced, I watch the rest of <em>Romulus</em> with my eyes narrowed suspiciously, waiting for another Easter egg to (perhaps unintentionally, perhaps not) puncture the fourth wall and boop me on the nose with a “see what I did there?” Thankfully, the cast’s incredible acting and the film’s perfectly paced action effectively distract me from my fear of another reference lurking down a dark corridor. There are several truly gruesome scenes—acid burning off fingers, a facehugger artificially pumping someone’s lungs while attached to them, the gnarly cracking of ribs and spines, and a few brand-new takes on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3T883Iqt8Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3T883Iqt8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic chest bursting scene</a></span>—that will delight body horror fans. And all of this action is propelled forward by Spaeny and Jonsson, the latter of whom does such an impressive 180 with his character that it leaves me speechless. <em>Romulus</em> also adds a bit more lore to the franchise, specifically around a certain stage in the xenomorph’s evolution, that gives Álvarez an excuse to put a giant, wet, undulating vagina in the film, just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537">H.R. Giger intended</a></span>.<br></p><p>But just when I’ve forgotten about the torso of Holm lurking in a dimly lit corner, when I’ve just been delighted by a zero-G action sequence that involves floating, spiraling acid blood Rain and Andy must avoid while suspended in mid-air, when I realize that Álvarez almost perfectly times the outpost’s countdown timer until it will collide with the planet’s icy ring to the runtime of the film, <em>Romulus</em> comes back around to the references. The proto pulse rifles from <em>Aliens</em>, Rook spouting an exact quote Holm uttered in <em>Alien</em>, Spaeny in her cryo-undies wielding a gun just like Ripley, Andy stammering “get away from her you bitch,” a human/xeno hybrid that makes your skin crawl, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/46459157/Alien-3-Hydra&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/46459157/Alien-3-Hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face-to-face moment just like the meme</a></span>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, <em>Romulus</em> ends strong, with an emotionally powerful, deliciously disgusting final scene with a jump-scare that almost made me pee myself. I just wish that it had the confidence to stand on its own a bit more, rather than deliver nods and recycled lines on a silver platter with a wry smile. Though, whether you’re a fan of the franchise or not, I believe <em>Alien: Romulus </em>is worth a watch—maybe some fans will adore the references, and those who know nothing about Ridley Scott’s legendary sci-fi universe can remain blissfully unaware and just enjoy a well-paced, well-shot, well-acted romp. It’s a win-win in that regard. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That means everyone can jump in and give the space sim a chance, as well as try out all "top 16 ships", "granting both green and grizzled pilots the ability to try out eligible ships before choosing which one to vote for" at this year's Ship Showdown event.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks, the community has been <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community-hub/events/ship-showdown-2954-7aT64SGx9K8ZL?selection=all">voting</a> for their favourite ships and ground vehicles with their own "original creations", including videos, songs, photos, paintings, and more.</p>
<p>Now the final 16 ships are battling it out "across eight diverse categories", with the final eight selected on 23rd August.</p>
<p>"Ship Showdown sees the Star Citizen community voting for their favourite vehicles, and this year a shortlist of sixteen ships will be battling it out across different categories," developer Cloud Imperium Games explains.</p>
<p>"As part of the celebration, every player will gain free access to all sixteen ships for a limited time, so they can try them out before voting."</p>
<p>After the top four ships are determined later in August, "all current players that possess the top four ships in-game will receive a limited-edition ship paint and corresponding manufacturer’s poster to show off their ship’s popularity". The final winning vehicle will get the "ultimate prize", the first official event banner, "which can be placed as a decoration in player’s hangars".</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing for yourself why Star Citizen has raised an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">astonishing $700m in crowdfunding</a>, <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen">sign up now</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-ordered-to-pay-27k-to-disabled-worker-in-return-to-office-discrimination-claim">Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) was ordered to pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee</a> who brought a discrimination claim against the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega's Eternal Champions is the next video game franchise to get a silver-screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Whilst it's hardly surprising that filmmakers are still rooting through video game catalogues for ideas, I can't say I had Sega's 1993 fighting game on my bingo card for the next series to be getting an adaptation.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sega-eternal-champions-movie-skydance-1235975970/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, that's exactly what's happening, with Jurassic World trilogy writer Derek Connolly set to write the live-action screenplay.</p>

<p>Connolly also boasts co-writing credits on Detective Pikachu.</p>
<p>David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger will produce for Skydance, with Sega producer Toru Nakahara overseeing the adaptation as he did for the Sonic the Hedgehog movies.</p>
<p>Eternal Champions was released on the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. It went on to spawn a sequel as well as a couple of spin-off games, cementing itself in the annals of fighting game history.</p>
<p>Eternal Champions is just one of several adaptations in production right now, including Amazon Prime's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-show-drops-a-new-teaser-trailer">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> TV series, which is set to premiere on 24th October.</p>
<p>On the subject of video game movies… Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick would like you to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">give the new Borderlands movie "a chance"</a> because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during an earnings call earlier this month, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick said its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p></div>

            <p>15 minutes of Astro Bot has once again leaked online, giving us a premature peek at what to expect when the game releases on 6th September.</p>
<p>In news unlikely to surprise you, the video has already been removed from YouTube (although you can still find copies of it if you're prepared to go looking), but eagle-eyed fans nonetheless managed to get a peek at the main hub, as well as a sneaky glimpse at some of the bots we can expect.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd prefer to keep everything a surprise, head back to the </strong><a href="http://eurogamer.net/"><strong>main page</strong></a><strong> now. For those excited and happy for a little head's up, read on…</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/15_minutes_of_astro_bot_gameplay_has_leaked_on/">u/brolt0001</a>, there wasn't much gameplay on display, but "where you see the different worlds is nice", and there's a "main hub", where "all the bots are gathered in one place doing their own thing".</p>
<p>Fans who managed to watch the video before it was pulled mentioned special bot appearances from Trico, Machine, Leon Kennedy, Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter and Raiden, Gray Fox, and Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/comment/liip8ob/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Others</a> spotted Gravity Rush's Kat and Raven, Octodad, Sly Cooper, Dante, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, Persona 5's Joker, Infamous' Cole, Spyro, Pyramid Head, and the cat from Stray.</p>
<p>The leak comes just weeks after another video - this time an eight-minute snippet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-eight-minutes-of-astro-bot">leaked from ChinaJoy</a>.</p>
<p>Did you see the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-unveils-adorable-astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-complete-with-playful-pair-of-eyes">DualSense controller inspired by Astro Bot</a>? The controller itself boasts all the features you would expect from a DualSense, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. These will all come into play when Astro Bot releases next month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
