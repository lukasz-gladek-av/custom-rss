                <p>Season 17 of Rare's online pirate title Sea of Thieves was announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it'll add a mischievous new faction to the game's sandbox called The Smuggler's League. The upcoming season, titled Smugglers' Tide, begins in August and includes new Voyages and some of the most powerful explosives in the game.</p><p>Judging from the trailer, The Smuggler's League is all about, well, smuggling loot, salvaging treasure and other goodies from sunken ships or stealing them from other players. Some of the new loot showcased in the trailer includes crates filled with golden bottles and black gunpowder barrels, which will most certainly explode if mishandled, but players can weaponize their explosive capabilities.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalWScU3-dU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GalWScU3-dU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer showcases characters using harpoon guns to snag loot and employing stealth tactics to make off with explosive barrels. While the trailer doesn't go into detail about faction-specific rewards, expect to earn several exclusive cosmetics for completing Smuggler's Voyages and commendations.</p><p>The current season of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/" data-ref-id="1100-6531724" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/">one-of-a-kind Sea of Thieves</a>, titled Reapers Rule, began on May 22, adding new content for The Reaper's Bones faction. The season also added a new Voyage, the ability to summon NPC skeletons to assist your crew, and a portable cannon called the Cannon of Rage.</p><p>Rare is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/" data-ref-id="1100-6529543" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/">developing a title called Everwild</a>, but the game was a no-show at this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

                <p>Keeper, the newest game from acclaimed adventure-game developers Double Fine and veteran designer Lee Petty, was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. As the name implies, the game involves a moving lighthouse--though whether you're playing and the lighthouse or a being managing it (a "keeper") isn't quite clear. A green bird appears frequently alongside the lighthouse, seeming to aid and guide the lighthouse as it travels through a variety of colorful environments including gemstone-adorned caves, treacherous cliffsides, ancient ruins, and a desolate plain. The bird also seems to be important for solving puzzles, as the trailer demonstrates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAwVgTsFfk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also get a brief look at some very large beings that could either be mechanical monstrosities or organic giants. How the lighthouse will deal with these obstacles, or if they're even threats at all, remains unclear. Keeper will release on Xbox Series X and PC on October 17, 2025.</p>

The game is fully 3D and looks every bit as challenging as the games that preceded it. It also features the ghosts of previous attempts, which is a staple for the series.</p><p>The game is apparently being developed by Sluggerfly (Hell Pie), Headup Games (Casual Loop), and Team Meat.</p><p>The game is coming coming Xbox Platforms early next year.</p>

<h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>
<p>A final reveal for the show comes in the form of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, taking what looks to be a major departure from the realistic approach we've seen all these years. Mason is back, which means T.V static and mind-bending narrative twists. No release date nor window as of yet.</p>

            <p>
Game Freak, the developer of the Pokémon series, has revealed its new game Beast of Reincarnation at today's Xbox Games Showcase.
</p>
<p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">previously known as Project Bloom and was announced back in 2023</a> as the developer signed a deal with Private Division.
</p>
<p>
Now we finally got a look at gameplay with a new trailer ahead of its release next year across Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5. It'll also be out on Game Pass on Xbox and PC.
</p>

<p>
Beast of Reincarnation takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan as players take the role of Emma the Sealer confronting the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.
</p>
<p>
The trailer for the action-adventure game showed plenty of third-person combat against giant beasts, as well as exploration and platforming. It certainly has a very unique and intriguing world mixing traditional and sci-fi aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
The game will be published by Fictions, a new game publisher founded by a collection of game developers.
</p>
<p>
"It's incredible to be working with game director Furushima-san and the renowned development team at Game Freak. We greatly value their continued collaboration and trust," said Mika Kurasawa, executive producer at Fictions. "We are so excited to show players a glimpse into the stunning world and intense combat of Beast of Reincarnation."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/double-fines-new-living-lighthouse-game-is-keeper/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Coming from Lee Petty and Double Fine, Keeper is a wonderful looking narrative adventure where you play as a lighthouse come to life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Keeper is a story told without words”, Double Fine writes in the trailer blurb, “in which a long-forgotten lighthouse is awakened and, joined by a spirited seabird, embarks upon a heartening tale of unlikely companionship and an unexpected journey into realms beyond understanding.”</p>
<p>It honestly looks delightful with all the charm that you would expect from Double Fine. The Lighthouse reassembles itself after falling over in a storm, forming legs for itself and then scrambling crab-like across the land. The rickety structure is full of personality, and can look and shine light from its top. It also makes friends with a seabird who wants to come along for the ride.</p>
<p>Keeper is in development for Xbox Series X|S, PC and will on Xbox Game Pass on day one, the game launching on 17th October.</p>

<p>This is the first game from Double Fine since Psychonauts 2, which I handed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">a fantastic 9/10 back in 2021</a>. Is said, “A decade and a half on from the original, Psychonauts 2 is a worthy successor to Double Fine’s cult classic. The platforming and combat gameplay is tighter, the world design is as varied and inventive as ever, and while the story is full of twists, turns and comedic moment, there’s also a wonderful sense of empathy and tenderness throughout. Simply put, Psychonauts 2 has been worth the wait.”</p>

<p>All we got was a teaser trailer and the reveal that this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2025-to-feature-six-fully-fledged-round-based-zombies-maps-rumor/">Call of Duty</a> is once again a new Black Ops title, but one notable fact missing in the teaser is that Call of Duty is, for at least another year, still launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of course, it'll also launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 is also the latest Call of Duty to add some celebrity star-power to its cast, with Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason, the game's protagonist. While the teaser doesn't show any gameplay or reveal any hints as to what's changing in this year's Call of Duty game, it does make it clear that the campaign will lean more into the fantastical, similar to what players saw in Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>"<em>Our official teaser sets the tone for players to embrace the madness that's incoming with Black Ops 7's story,</em>" Activision's head of publishing and marketing, Tyler Bahl, told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/call-duty-black-ops-7-reveal">Windows Central</a> in an interview.</p>
<p>"<em>Delivering consecutive Black Ops games also allows our teams the tremendous opportunity to tap not only into our own creativity but also embrace the shift from a '90s setting to the new 2035 future setting within our marketing</em>."</p>
<p>One interesting bit revealed in an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/xbox-games-showcase-2025-recap-everything-announced/"> Xbox Wire</a> post following the showcase is that the campaign will be playable entirely in co-op, and that it's once again Raven Software behind the campaign mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Raven Software is leading up the campaign, the game's development is primarily being led by Treyarch. Though, as is the case with all Call of Duty games, several of the studios under Activision will be working on Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>This teaser was just the beginning of what will surely be a massive marketing campaign for Black Ops 7, with more to come later this summer. "<em>The full reveal of Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, so the community should be on the lookout for teases, clues, and the surprises that the Black Ops series is known for,</em>" Bahl said in the same aforementioned interview. "<em>It's an exciting time as we prepare for a new Call of Duty reveal, and the next great experience to come</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Xbox held its annual Xbox Games Showcase, and it contained glimpses of what lies in store for Xbox fans around the world. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>release date revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fxeDrWTh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=KLBxjrb1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>arrives this October.</figcaption></figure><p>The show kicked off with a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, as well as a new look at the setting of Obsidian's new action RPG. It all looks very wacky and very satirical, just like the first game. This one's launching on October 29th.</p>

<h2><em>High on Life 2&nbsp;</em>has more crazy talking weapons and colorful action</h2>

<p>Next up, Squanch Games announced&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em>, a sequel to the 2022 shooter that looks to offer much of the same colorful, fast-paced action (and plenty of talking weapons, of course). It's coming this winter, and you'll be able to play it on day one with Game Pass.</p>

<h2><em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy&nbsp;</em>looks very odd indeed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PBK85eCz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=wh23j_R9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe it or not, this is a&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>From Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</em>, which is presumably some kind of&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>spinoff. We didn't get too much on this one; just a cinematic trailer, a 2026 release window, and a lot of questions. Day one on Game Pass again!</p>

<h2>A special Xbox ROG Ally is coming this holiday season</h2>

<p>Oh, Xbox, you cheeky monkeys. Next up is an announcement for a special ROG Xbox Ally handheld, with an X variant also available with superior specs. Both consoles prominently show&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>being played on them, because of course.</p>

<h2><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>gets a spooky new trailer</h2>

<p>Next, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco showed off&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, their upcoming vampiric action RPG. We got to see some suitably dark combat and traversal gameplay, but we didn't get a release date; just a 2026 release window.</p>

<h2>Meat Boy returns in a 3D platforming extravaganza</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PSxQlTFx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=It14mbQ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Meat Boy 3D&nbsp;</em>is pretty self-explanatory.</figcaption></figure><p>Iconic platforming blob Meat Boy made a return in the next trailer, which eschews his usual hyper-masocore 2D trappings in favor of a 3D environment. It is, as you might expect, called&nbsp;<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em>, and it's coming early next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>gets a release date and an ultra-fast-paced trailer</h2>




<p>If you were worried&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>wouldn't offer the same ridiculously fast-paced action for which the series is known, today's trailer should have put your fears to rest. It's coming on October 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is getting story DLC</h2>

<p>A brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is on its way, and I for one am glad, because I can't get enough of that Troy Baker voice.&nbsp;<em>The Order of Giants&nbsp;</em>arrives on September 4th.</p>

<h2>Game Freak reveals&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em></h2>

<p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>studio Game Freak making a&nbsp;<em>Nier Automata</em>-style action RPG wasn't on my bingo card, but there it is.&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>is another intriguing-looking action RPG</h2>




<p>Next, inXile showed off its upcoming steampunk action RPG&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, which looks like it'll combine the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>, and Obsidian's own&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds</em>. You can play this one "in due time", so no release date, unfortunately.</p>

<h2>Obsidian announces&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em></h2>

<p>Miniaturized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, Obsidian revealed during today's show. It's a very vibrant-looking survival game that's coming to Game Preview on July 29th, which ain't too far off at all.</p>

<h2>Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>scares up a storm this fall</h2>

<p>If, like anyone else with taste, you were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">disappointed by&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>(sorry, fans), then&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>might be the antidote you've been waiting for. This Bloober Team survival horror game launches in fall.</p>

<h2><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>is a cinematic-looking adventure game from Don't Nod</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=d5uaPz5R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=1x9_VOZB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>almost feels like a throwback to games like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Our next reveal was&nbsp;<em>Aphelion</em>, an adventure game from Don't Nod that looks like it owes more than a small debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>and the newer&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It's being made in collaboration with the European Space Agency, and it launches next year.</p>

<h2><em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly lying to you</h2>




<p>Next, it's a frankly bizarre-looking game (and I say that as a compliment) that appears to be one part renovation sim to one part spooky horror game and another part...er, reggae musical? It's definitely not a no from me.&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>launches next year as a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<h2><em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>is getting Japanese gods in fall</h2>

<p>More gods are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Heavenly Spear&nbsp;</em>DLC, which brings the ancient Japanese pantheon in fall. We got a glimpse of some iconic Japanese gods, like Yamata-no-Orochi, in the trailer.</p>

<h2><em>Mudang: Two Hearts&nbsp;</em>tackles a twisty-turny Korean story</h2>




<p>Next up, we got a look at a brand new game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Mudang: Two Hearts</em>, and it looks like a pretty original prospect. Gameplay looks to be split between open-ended stealthy shooting and setpieces, but we'll get to find out when it launches in 2026.</p>

<h2>Thunderful announces&nbsp;<em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</em></h2>

<p><em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf&nbsp;</em>is a followup to the 2023 cinematic platformer, and it'll return to the story of Lana and Mui, utilizing a very similar-looking visual and gameplay style to the original. It's coming next year, because of course it is.</p>

<h2><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>brings the anime to life this year (and next)</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see some suitably anime-looking gameplay for the action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which comes to PC this year and to Xbox next year. It adapts the popular anime, so if you're a fan, it's safe to start getting excited.</p>

<h2><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>vibes, but without the guns</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=CunMeAA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=27gE1gsL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>feels like a more peaceful&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was perhaps a touch too edgy for your tastes (as I did), then&nbsp;<em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>looks like it might be the game for you. It's got similar open-world&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-style vibes, but without the guns and forced labor. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus announces&nbsp;<em>Fate's End</em></h2>

<p><em>Fate's End&nbsp;</em>is a brand new sidescroller from&nbsp;<em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus, and it looks to marry that developer's love of hand-drawn art and storytelling with a more hands-on style reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Jotunn</em>. This one launches...yup, you guessed it. Next year.</p>

<h2><em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>is absolutely getting that remake we all knew about</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=UDzywbYe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=EfyUAK5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, that&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake is real. Surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, all that remained for Atlus was to make its&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-domain-registration" rel="nofollow">remake</a> official given comments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" rel="nofollow">made by certain voice actors</a>, and the studio did exactly that in this show. It's called&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, but we don't have a release date yet.</p>

<h2><em>Invincible VS&nbsp;</em>is a three-on-three tag fighter based on the comics</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to see Skybound Games and Quarter Up's&nbsp;<em>Invincible VS</em>, a fighting game based on the comics (and the popular animated show) coming next year. It looks exactly as bloodily brutal as you'd expect.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>are coming to Xbox</h2>

<p>Square Enix revealed that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>will make their way to Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>VII Remake&nbsp;</em>coming this winter and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>coming...well, today! You can pick the latter up right now. I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">not surprised the studio has made this decision</a>.</p>

<h2>Double Fine's next game lets you, er, play as a lighthouse</h2>




<p>Well, I can't say it's ever been done before, at any rate. Double Fine announced its next game during the show, and you get to play as a rather adorable combination of a lighthouse and a scraggly-looking bird.&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on October 17th.</p>

<h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is coming, and it looks trippy as heck</h2>




<p>The final announcement during today's show was, of course,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and it concludes with a confrontation between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2&nbsp;</em>protagonist David Mason and Raul Menendez, with plenty of trippy-looking architecture and futuristic trappings to boot.</p>

<hr><p>That's all for today! Make sure to check out our recaps for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">main Summer Game Fest show</a> and the PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">State of Play presentation</a> that aired earlier this week if you want to catch up on this summer showcase period's news.</p>

            <p>'Weird' is one of those words I try to avoid because it usually just means "I'm not going to even attempt to understand or unpack the specific thing this is going for", but supernatural hotel renovator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</a> really stood out to me this evening for a tone that felt pretty singular in a weekend weighed down by soulslikes and shooters. Broadly, it looks like your Powerwash Sims and House Flippers, but with the added wrinkle that neither of the games feature dapper old gents crooning ska ditties at you. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>So, yeah: I'm into more or less everything here. The secrets and puzzles to solve between renovations. The ghostbustery multitool. The We Have The Specials At The Hotel soundtrack. The Wicker Man reference. The spiders stealing fire extinguishers and washing machines. It looks like a game with ideas, basically. And even if some those ideas are distinctly 'like that other thing', I dig the way they've been implemented. Also, one of those ideas is 'go for a motorbike ride with a cat'. Information's a bit scant on this one so far, but it's due for a release sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Double Fine's next game is called Keeper and it's about steering a four-legged lighthouse through a lush 3D world, with some puzzle-solving along the way. Its creation is being led by Lee Petty, who was previously project lead on Double Fine's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rad">RAD</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/headlander">Headlander</a>. There's a trailer below, which also brings news that it won't be long before it releases.

<p>Cor, it certainly looks nice, doesn't it? 
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/keeper-double-fine-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire post</a> doesn't contain too much more information about what you do in the game beyond what's shown in the trailer. It does mention that the initial inspiration lay in the pandemic, the isolation of lockdowns and the escape offered by walks in nature near where director Lee Petty lived. 
</p>
<p>Double Fine are most closely associated with company founder Tim Schafer, the creative lead behind their point-and-click adventures and more recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>. There are plenty of other creative leads at the studio though, and Alec and Sin previously enjoyed both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/headlander-review">Headlander</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rad-review">RAD</a> in their respective reviews.
</p>
<p>I don't need to know more. If it's fairly straightforward cinematic platforming in a world that looks like that, I think I'd be happy enough. And the release date - October 17th - doesn't leave much time left to wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn't get to see much of the game, but the environments we got a brief look at appeared to be significantly visually improved from the original.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the announcement, developer P-Studio director Kazuhisa Wada shared the following messages:</p><blockquote>We are very pleased to announce the release of Persona 4 Revival. We look forward to sharing even more information in due time.</blockquote><blockquote>Persona 4 has spawned numerous spin-off works, including TV anime, Persona 4 Arena, Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, and Persona 4: Dancing All Night, and is a special title that has been a part of Atlus for many years and holds a personal place in my heart. We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love. We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans and we look forward to sharing it with you all.</blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, we are actively preparing for the future development of the Persona series as a studio. We are working hard to meet the expectations of fans around the world and our work is progressing well. Please stay tuned for more updates.</blockquote><blockquote>We look forward to your continued support of the Persona series.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have been gossiping about a proper Persona 4 remake for a while now, fueled by recent registered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-a-new-domain-discovery-is-getting-persona-4-fans-excited-for-a-possible-remake">domain names</a>, industry insiders, and more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-4-remake-is-apparently-happening-as-voice-actor-confirms-hes-not-coming-back-for-it">multiple of the original voice actors</a> saying they would not be returning for the then-unannounced remake, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-more-persona-4-actors-have-said-theyre-not-returning-for-an-unannounced-persona-4-remake">sparking conspiracy theories</a> about their posts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/12/10/shin-megami-tensei-persona-4-review">gave the original Persona 4 a 9/10</a> back in the day, saying, "A significant improvement over the previous Persona games in many ways, Persona 4 provides a deeper dungeon crawling/social link experience that makes it engaging to play."

It's exactly what it sounds like: a 3D Super Meat Boy game, and it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in early 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's trailer sure does look like exactly what is says on the tin: it's fast, gory gameplay through short, sharp obstacle courses full of machines that can tear a little meat guy apart. Meat Boy bounces his way through them, leaving a trailer of, uh, meat juice, wherever he lands, with slidey physics down walls and tight jumping windows. But of course, it's all in a 3D world instead of a 2D space, which will likely dramatically change how the platforming works, where you can go, and the sorts of challenges placed before you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meat Boy began as a 2008 Flash game created by Edmund McMillen and Jonathan McEntee that has since grown into a sensation with the subsequent release of Super Meat Boy a few years later. Super Meat Boy is an ultra-hard platformer beloved for its tight, precise platforming and fast respawns on short maps that allow players to try again and again and again with almost no downtime. The games are notoriously gorey, given that the main character is essentially made of meat and keeps slamming into meat grinders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A sequel to Super Meat Boy, Super Meat Boy Forever, was released in 2020 without the involvement of McMillen. It's unclear if McMillen is involved in this 3D rendition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weirdly, there was a green Mario warp pipe shown at the start of the trailer, despite Super Meat Boy 3D not being announced for a Nintendo console at the moment, and this being an Xbox showcase. No explanation for that at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">today's Xbox Games Showcase right here</a>, and keep up on the bevy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-reveals-from-ign-live-2025">new announcements all weekend at IGN Live here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Like last year's Persona 3 Reloaded, this new version of Persona 4 is a brand-new edition of the classic 2008 RPG by Atlus.</p><p>The announcement teaser is light on information, aside from confirming that it takes place in the quiet countryside town of Inaba away from the bustling metropolis of the other entries, with a few shots of its high school classrooms and the town's streets, with just a few seconds of the protagonist running through them. It of course won't be too long before he goes head-first into a strange mystery storyline, as he joins his friends to investigate seemingly unsolvable murders while harnessing the power of Personas to crack the case.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Persona 4 Revival - Teaser Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>A remake of Persona 4 became the worst-kept secret in gaming, as prior to its announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-voice-actor-says-he-wasnt-invited-back-for-a-still-unannounced-remake/1100-6531861/">voice actor Yuri Lowenthal confirmed that he would not be reprising his role</a> as Yosuke Hanamura for the game. "For those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal said in a since-deleted post on BlueSky. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p>Other actors linked to the original game also mentioned that they wouldn't be back, and a domain registration linked to the game added more fuel to the fire. It is worth noting that an enhanced version of the original game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/">Persona 4 Golden</a>, is available right now in case you don't want to wait for the remake. First released for the PS Vita handheld in 2012, it was later ported to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Didn't we just get a new Black Ops game in 2024? We did, and this will be the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is being developed by Treyarch and Raven Software--the same lead co-developers as Black Ops 6--and takes place in the year 2035. That's more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6 and 10 years after the events of Black Ops 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUo5gnaYB_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uUo5gnaYB_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Activision said the story in Black Ops 7 will be the "most mind-bending" ever, and that's saying something for a series known for its twists and turns.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 7, "the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." David Mason and his team return to fight a "manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else." The game will allow players to use "cutting-edge technology."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has a campaign mode that supports solo and co-op, along with multiplayer, of course. Black Ops 7 also brings back round-based Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, Activision has only released the cinematic teaser seen above, but the company said it will have more announcements to share in the weeks and months ahead. Activision Publishing boss Tyler Bahl said, "We're excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968" data-ratio="0.55820476858345" data-width="713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 is coming this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The "full reveal" for Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, but Activision didn't say when that might happen. Activision also didn't reveal a release date but confirmed the game is coming this year to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Xbox PC app, Steam, and Battle.net). Being a first-party title, Black Ops 7 is also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass at launch. There was no mention of Black Ops 7 for Nintendo Switch 2, which is curious considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/">Microsoft and Nintendo have a decade-long Call of Duty deal.</a></p>

                <p>A pair of Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox, and one of them is coming <em>extremely</em> soon. As announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming this winter. And the most recent numbered series entry, Final Fantasy XVI, is coming to Xbox today.</p><p>A brief trailer showed off both games back to back. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/final-fantasy-16-xbox-games-showcase/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">associated blog entry</a> noted that every mainline, single-player Final Fantasy game is coming to Xbox platforms, so that will surely include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth as well. No release date has been given for that second part of the Remake trilogy.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the full version of Remake, including the Yuffie-centered DLC that leads the story right into Rebirth. Final Fantasy XVI, meanwhile, is its own story following Clive Rosfield as he navigates global politics in a world where kingdoms have access to massive destructive summoned creatures called Eikons as their ultimate power.</p>

She's searching for Thomas, a fellow astronaut who got separated from her at the start of the game. The duo are surveying the plant to see whether it's habitable after humans mucked up Earth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZs_IthEb2s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZs_IthEb2s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of gameplay, not much is shown in the trailer. Presumably, the game will have a focus on story and choices like past Don't Nod titles, but the trailer suggests platforming (and falling) will be a regular part of the experience as well. The ending of the trailer teases some sort of alien or otherworldly element, likely one that's dangerous to both Ariane and Thomas--the description beneath the trailer describes "shifting realities."</p><p>Aphelion is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in 2026.</p>
