An influx of speculators during the pandemic years and a volatile secondhand market built around min-maxing profits from reselling the most valuable cards in between reprints has also hurt morale around the game for some. </p><p> Rosewater told <em>IGN</em> these bad vibes aren’t necessarily born out in the data that Wizards gets from market research and customer responses in the aggregate. “People just wanna attribute–I don’t know, it’s the nature of the internet of, like, ‘they’re up to no good,’ or, ‘they don’t have our our issues in mind,’” he said, citing the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> set from last year as it’s most “successful” ever. “We very much care what players think. We do surveys and everything, we do market research. We don’t wanna just make something, we wanna make something we honestly believe that the players to their core will enjoy, and that drives our decisions.”</p><p>The interview was published this week but conducted prior to the latest controversy to hit <em>MTG</em>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-commander-banned-cards-wizards-1851661288?_gl=1*bi4a5f*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4NDUzNi4xMjQuMS4xNzI3OTg2MTY4LjUuMC4w">the banning of several powerful cards in its popular Commander format</a></span>. Following an online harassment campaign targeting some members of the volunteer-staffed Rules Committee which issued the bans, Wizards of the Coast announced the group would be dissolved and the decisions would be taken back in-house to shield people from abuse. It’s still not clear how that will all ultimately play out. </p><p>In the meantime, however, two Universes Beyond sets that might end up among the most popular yet are due out next year:<em>&nbsp;</em>cards based around both the<em> Final Fantasy </em>games and on <em>Marvel</em> comic book heroes. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Vice President of the Rainbow 6 franchise, Cameron Lee, has left the franchise and Ubisoft.</p>



<p>Cameron Lee joined the Rainbow 6 brand in April 2022 after working as Vice President of Production at Activision but had previously had over 20 years of experience as a producer, manager, and VP at companies including EA, Bungie, and BioWare, and has worked on such franchises as Tony Hawk, Call of Duty, and Dragon Age.</p>



<p>Following the announcement to join the Rainbow 6 franchise, Ubisoft said that Lee “will be responsible for creating the long-term brand strategy for the Rainbow Six franchise and aligning and collaborating with all internal partners.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear why Lee decided to leave the franchise and the company, but an internal email sent to staff reads, “For the time being, the role of VP and Executive Producer for the Rainbow Six brand will not be replaced.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Ubisoft for comment on Lee’s departure but has not received a comment.</p>

<p>Motorsport Games, the studio behind Le Mans Ultimate and other racing video games, has had another round of layoffs. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming first learned of the layoffs earlier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikestrawmedia.com/post/3l5mr2bpput25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Thursday</a> across the studio’s social media and marketing departments, but couldn’t confirm the number of employees that were impacted. <a href="https://traxion.gg/le-mans-ultimate-hangs-in-the-balance-as-studio-hit-by-further-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Traxion</a>, which was formerly owned by Motorsport Games, reports that 10 employees were let go in the latest round. Insider Gaming has since been able to corroborate that the number is “around there”, per sources.</p>



<p>After talks of layoffs began, a brand and marketing manager for the company took to social media to confirm that he had been “made redundant from Studio 397 and Motorsport Games due to further reductions in the workforce.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-more-layoffs-at-motorsport-games">Why More Layoffs At Motorsport Games?</h2>



<p>As far as why the layoffs are taking place, Insider Gaming understands that the studio has continued to struggle to find investors to help fund the company. Multiple sources have said that the company has continued to look for various funding opportunities, but nothing substantial has been achieved yet.</p>



<p>“They’re trying, but they need more than what they’re getting,” said one source. “The goal remains to release Le Mans Ultimate on console in the future.”</p>



<p>Motorsport Games is scheduled to hole a  “Special Meeting of Stockholders” on October 25 in Miami, Florida. As part of the meeting, they will hold a vote to approve a purchase of up to 949,310 shares of Motorsport Games Class A Common Stock. Should that deal be approved and the company sell all of the aforementioned shares, it could bring in roughly $1.5 million in funding based on the current market price of Motorsport Games shares.</p>



<p>In October 2023, Motorsport Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-announces-new-console-game-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold the license to NASCAR</a> to iRacing. Not long after, the company also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-terminates-agreement-with-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost the license</a> to the Indy Car game that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-indycar-game-status-up-in-the-air-at-motorsport-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had been in development</a>. </p>



<p>Motorsport Games has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment from Insider Gaming on the layoffs and status of the company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A beloved RPG series celebrated its 30th anniversary.</h2></div><section><p>Bandai Namco recently announced Tales of Graces f Remastered as the first title in the Tales Remastered Project, celebrating the Tales of 30th anniversary. We both got to go hands-on with Tales of Graces f Remastered and speak with the game’s producer, Yuki Ishikawa, who talked to us about the series’ future and the possibility of a Tales of Abyss Remake. </p><p>First, we asked why Tales of Graces f Remastered was chosen as the first title in the Tales of Remastered Program. One, Graces f is one of the more beloved titles of Tales of, Ishikawa said. It’s especially heralded for its battle system. Two, it was just “good timing to make this a remastered title.” </p><p>What Ishikawa means by “good timing” in this moment is related to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-arise-review">Tales of Arise’s wide, positive reception</a> not just within Japan, but with the overseas audience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When the team is thinking of what comes next for us, if they were to bring up something that is like a 2D pixel kind of game that was only on a Famitsu console the last time, there would be a huge gap between people who have liked Tales of Arise and then with that kind of content,” Ishikawa explained.</p><p>And three, the original version of Tales of Graces f had only four languages, so with a remaster, the Tales team is able to bring Tales of Graces f to a wider audience with more language options. This is especially true considering Graces f has been “stuck” on the PS3, at least over in the West, since its initial release here in 2012. Tales of Graces f Remastered is being released on pretty much all platforms–Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, <em>and</em> PC.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards</p></div><p>“In the past there were certain titles that were platform exclusive, but as of this moment and in terms of the current direction of the Tales of team, they're not looking to have the title or any upcoming titles to be platform exclusive,” Ishikawa explained. “We want to bring Tales Of to a wider audience. So we think one of the ways is by having it available on as many platforms as possible.” </p><p>Of course, there’s more to come after Tales of Graces f Remastered. </p><p>Personally, Ishikawa is a fan of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/11/tales-of-the-abyss-review">Tales of the Abyss</a>, and quoted it as one of the reasons why he entered the company [Bandai Namco]. “If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Tales of Graces f Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“The goal for the Tales of IP in general is to make the IP grow,” Ishikawa explained. “So it’s not to say that the Tales of series is going to end with Tales of Arise…So whether there is an entirely new title, whether it’s a remaster, whether it’s a remake, we can’t say for sure, but we definitely want to keep moving forward.” </p><p>For more on Tales, don’t miss our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-hands-on-a-tasteful-modernization-of-a-classic-rpg">Tales of Graces f Remastered Hands-on preview</a>.</p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Guides Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's a great price for a 10,000mAh power bank with USB-C output that can fast charge a Nintendo Switch at its maximum rate. Baseus hasn't been long around enough to develop the same reputation as Anker, but its power banks have been steadily racking up favorable reviews and recommendations. They are also less expensive than an equivalent Anker model.</p><h2>Baseus 10,000mAh USB Type-C Power Bank for $11.99</h2><div id="187616" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Baseus 10,000mAh 20W Portable Charger</h3></p></div><p>If you're looking for a good power bank to complement your Nintendo Switch, then a 10,000mAh power bank is the perfect balance between size and battery capacity. This Baseus power bank measures 6" long and 2.7" wide, about the same size as an iPhone 14 Pro, and weighs in at only 7 ounces. With a 10,000mAh capacity, this power bank can completely charge a Nintendo Switch or Switch OLED around 1.5 to 2 times, even if you factor in approximately 80% power efficiency.</p><p>The Baseus power bank has three ports. The USB-C port serves as both output and input, the USB Type-A port is output only, and the Micro USB port is input only. The USB-C port features up to 18W of Power Delivery. Coincidentally, the Nintendo Switch and Switch OLED accept a maximum charging rate of 18W, so this power bank can charge your Switch as fast as the OEM wall charger. Not only does that shorten the time it takes to charge your Switch, you'll also be able to play games while charging without draining the battery. The Baseus power bank is UL certified and comes with built-in safety protections you'd expect from a decent quality power bank. There's no digital display, but it does feature an LED battery indicator that you can check with a press of a button.</p><h2>TSA-Approved</h2><p>Note that the TSA requires all power banks to be brought in carry-on bags; <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/power-banks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power banks are not allowed in check-in</a> regardless of capacity. The Baseus power bank's 10,000mAh capacity is well below TSA's 27,000mAh carry-on limit, so it can be brought onto planes. It's also low-profile enough that no one will take notice in the first place. If a TSA official actually does take the initiative to test the wattage on your power bank, you're well in the clear.</p><p>For more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">best power banks of 2024</a>.

You'll meet new characters, take on fresh quests, and explore a hand-crafted planet. Whether you're thinking about buying (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-shattered-space-save-30-on-the-dlc-and-get-bonus-in-game-content/1100-6526803/" data-ref-id="1100-6526803">at a discount</a>) or playing Shattered Space or you want to know how far along you are in your current playthrough, knowing how long it takes to beat the DLC is worthwhile knowledge.</p><p>Below, you can see a rough estimate of how long it takes to beat Shattered Space as well as a full quest list.</p><h2>How long to beat Starfield Shattered Space</h2><p>As with any game or expansion, the time it ultimately takes you to get through Shattered Space is reliant on a few different factors. First and foremost, your time to beat the DLC mainly depends on how much exploring you do on Va'ruun'kai, the new planet where the entirety of the expansion takes place. If you simply blow through the main story without taking part in side content or outside exploration, you'll have a much shorter overall playtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png" data-ref-id="1300-4378512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png" data-ref-id="1300-4378512"></a><figcaption>Shattered Space takes place on a new planet with fresh characters and items. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4378512-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.10.02-16.15.23.28.png"></figure><p>That said, the entire main story in Shattered Space takes roughly <strong>eight hours</strong> to get through. This assumes you're not dying repeatedly, make one choice per quest and stick with it, and run from quest to quest without doing anything else. If you're on a higher difficulty level or reload saves to see the outcomes of different choices in certain quests, <strong>your overall playtime can be bumped to close to 10 hours</strong>.</p><p>In addition to the main story, there are 11 total side quests available to complete on Va'ruun'kai in Shattered Space. Some of these quests are shorter, but others are longer, so completing all of them will take around <strong>seven hours</strong>. Once again, this assumes you're not reloading too many saves or dying frequently. Your playtime could also be bumped up trying to locate and start all seven side quests, as some of them require you to visit different locations on Va'ruun'kai outside of Dazra.</p><p>All in all, if you complete the main story, find and finish all seven side quests, and do some exploration on Va'ruun'kai, you can expect to put in anywhere from <strong>15-20 hours</strong> in Shattered Space.</p><h2>Starfield Shattered Space full mission list</h2><p>Below, you can see all of the main story missions and side quests that are available in Shattered Space.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dedicated-fan-compiles-over-1000-pages-of-dungeons-dragons-lost-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A trove of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> lost content has been compiled. Thanks to one dedicated fan of the world's most popular TTRPG, hundreds of pages of supplements believed lost forever to the internet have been restored in a single convenient compendium.</p>
<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lost Content Compendium</h2>
<p>According to a news report from <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/3.5e-web-compendium">Wargamer</a>, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content compendium is the work of Reddit user u/Yawgmothlives. The user has been collecting free support material published by Wizards of the Coast for 3.5 edition of the fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=E5pUPVSK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-lost-content-the-orchard-screenshot.jpg?itok=7hM-o8hU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This material has been either made inaccessible, either intentionally removed or no longer supported by the official <em>D&amp;D</em> website in July 2014. This material includes extra abilities for certain classes, new monster statblocks, dozens of new spells, adventure locations, and additional content for previously published <em>D&amp;D</em> books.</p>
<p>This collection of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lost content has been called The Web Compendium. It contains 1,281 pages in total and is available for all players and TTRPG historians to enjoy via a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yt5r79daqnky372lo9lcf/The-Web-Compendium.pdf?rlkey=h2u2vsh4lovdgxbgfnkjds1kf&amp;e=2&amp;st=f9tdxb9w&amp;dl=0">dropbox link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Yawgmothlives' endeavor is a noble one in terms of media preservation. <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 3.5 edition was the second-most popular edition of the game, and still has a special place in the hearts of many players. Its the ruleset that <em>D&amp;D's</em> biggest competitor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, used as its foundation.</p>

                <p>It's the start of a new month, and Fanatical is kicking things off with the October 2024 edition of its Platinum Collection bundle deal. Like other Fanatical build-your-own bundle promotions, customers select from a list of games to create their own batch of discounted PC games. This month's bundle has 18 games to pick from, with various genres represented, including first-person shooters, RPGs, 3D platformers, horror games, and more. Every game is available for super cheap, and the more games you add to your bundle, the better the deal gets. Pricing starts at three games for $10 ($3.33 per key), but if you pick at least five games, the price drops to just $3 per key, and at seven or more games, you'll pay just $2.86 per game. There's no limit to how many games you can grab, meaning you could add all 18 games to your bundle and pay just $51.48 total.</p><p>There are some pretty good games to choose from here, including several hidden gems you might have missed, including the open-world first-person shooter <strong>Rage 2</strong>. Developed by Avalanche Studios as a sequel to id Software's 2011 shooter, Rage 2 is a bloody post-apocalyptic game featuring over-the-top sci-fi weapons and a vast ruined landscape to explore in giant vehicles.</p><p>Another great game to add to your bundle is <strong>No Straight Roads</strong>. This one has a great aesthetic and killer tracks to tap your feet to as you explore the world of Vinyl City, a musical metropolis under the control of an oppressive EDM empire. This is also the Encore Edition of the game that throws in a ton of extra content and gameplay tweaks.

            <p>I miss the height of Wordle mania not because of the game itself, which I still play on occasion, but because of the torrent of delightful, experimental browser-based puzzle games that followed in its wake. Worldle, Octordle, Moviedle, Waffle, Who Are Ya?, Cloudle and many, many more were a gold rush of bandwagon jumpers I was fully onboard with.
</p>
<p>Scrambled Maps takes me back to those good old days. It bears little relation to Wordle, but it is a browser-based puzzle game that offers one new challenge each day, and it is just as delightful a distraction.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The challenge is simple: a map of a part of the world has been sliced into 18 squares of equal size, and scrambled. You must reconstruct them, piecing together a jigsaw of roads and rivers, train lines and place names.
</p>
<p>This is more difficult than it may first seem. Maps have no edges, no corners, no blue sky, no easy footholds familiar to dedicated dissectologist. Instead you match coloured roads, building complexes and green fields, then look closer at road shapes and writing.
</p><p>In completing my first puzzle, I found tile after tile that linked together, but found it more difficult to position those tiles within the broader image. Did two tiles, which clearly fit together, go in the top right, the bottom left, the middle, or...? It was only after 25 minutes when I realised that I had constructed the map perfectly, but in two reversed halves: the nine tiles on the left belonged on the right, and vice versa. 
</p>
<p>As I fixed that issue, placing each tile in its correct position, a green border appeared around each one. Ah. The game confirms correct answers as you play. Useful.
</p>
<p>Like Wordle, no Scrambled Map seems truly difficult, only more or less time consuming. Like Wordle, it would be easy to cheat with a visit to OpenStreetMap (the source of the map data) or Google Maps. In any case, like Wordle, I'm hooked, and eagerly awaiting each new day's puzzle.

            <p>The Football Manager series has been around for decades, each of its yearly entries gradually building upon its core systems until it became the mixture of deep simulation and banal press conference screens it is today. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> is different: a fresh start for the series, built upon a new engine, which Sports Interactive are at pains to say will not immediately be as rich or robust as its predecessor.
</p>
<p>It now has a release date: November 26th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"FM25 is not a continuation of FM24. FM 25 is: 'This is the next generation of Football Manager' - and this is the first chapter in the new book of Football Manager, and will get expanded on," studio head Miles Jacobson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fm25-is-not-a-continuation-of-fm24-the-big-football-manager-interview">told Eurogamer last month</a>. Jacobson's comments mirror what was announced back in 2023, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">Football Manager 2024 was described as "the last of its kind"</a>.
</p>
<p>The biggest change is under the hood: Sports Interactive have traded their own proprietary engine for Unity, with the aim of upgrading the quality of 3D match engine, but also to speed up development of new features in a series that sometimes felt stagnant. 
</p><p>The implication is that Football Manager 2025 is a reset, or a short-term step backwards, to pave the way for greater and faster steps forward in future. In practical terms, it means Football Manager 2025 doesn't have some features players might be used to from recent iterations. No international management, no data chalkboard, no Create-a-Club, Challenge mode, Versus mode or Fantasy Draft. 
</p>
<p>What the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217490/Football_Manager_25/">Football Manager 2025 Steam page</a> says it will have is the Premier League license for the first time, women's football for the first time, more playable leagues and nations than ever, a brand new UI, and the "biggest technical and visual advancement for a generation." 
</p>
<p>I'm genuinely fascinated to see how FM2025's release plays out. On a yearly update cycle, it's inevitable that there are certain big new features or upgrades that are going to be out of reach because they don't fit within the schedule. Eventually that catches up to a series. I've occasionally been frustrated by Football Manager's slow progress and the nature of its new features, too, where it sometimes seems to introduce cruft more than real innovation. A reset might not be a bad thing, but it's a risk. 
</p>
<p>Or players could just keep playing FM2024. Someone will make a database update, I'm sure. We'll find out which way things go come November 26th.

                <p>It's officially spooky season, and Microsoft is getting in the swing of things by offering a pair of scary movies to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.

            <p>
Mario + Rabbids director Davide Soliani has teamed up with Red Dead Redemption lead designer and writer Christian Cantamessa to found a new studio, Day 4 Night.
</p>
<p>
Day 4 Night's first project, a new IP co-directed by Soliani and Cantamessa, is described by Xbox co-founder Ed Fries - whose 1Up Ventures is financing the studio alongside publisher Krafton - as "easily the most creative thing we have seen in quite some time".
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, details of the team's first game are limited, although Soliani calls the studio's work "a reflection of everything I've ever wanted to experience as a player - joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends."
</p>

<p>
"It's a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry," he continued, "to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It's a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together."
</p>
<p>
More broadly, Day 4 Night - which will operate across offices in Los Angeles and Milan - <a href="http://www.d4nstudios.com/">says</a> it's "focused on delivering deeply heartfelt and original games that innovate in storytelling and design.". Other members of the team include Luca Breda, Gian Marco Zanna, and Cristina Nava, who all worked on Mario + Rabbids at Ubisoft Milan, and whose credits at Ubisoft span the likes of Ghost Recon, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
Soliani, whose 25-year stint at Ubisoft included 11 years on both Mario + Rabbids games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">announced his departure</a> from the publisher back in July, teasing a "new adventure" to come.

Some of the negativity seems to be general dogpiling by players still upset over the base game, but there are a fair number of more reasonable people explaining why the DLC may be coming up short. Many hinge on the fact that aside from the story quest,<em> Shattered Space</em> is very light on other additional content, including more ship parts, weapons, armor, and other new features.<br></p><p>It’s clear <em>Shattered Space </em>is also burdened by the bar set by other massive single-player RPGs.

Long-time Bethesda fans are also comparing <em>Shattered Space</em> to <em>Fallout 4</em>'s <em>Far Harbor</em> DLC , another expansion that offered sprawling new areas to explore and some peak storytelling moments. </p><p> I’ve been playing <em>Shattered Space</em> all week and have a lot of thoughts but will hold them until my review is published. TL;DR: it’s complicated. And you can go on the <em>Starfield </em>subreddit and find plenty of fans who enjoyed the base game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1ft6t46/already_6_hours_in_and_so_far_i_feel_like_this_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are having a terrific time with the DLC</a></span>.

While there are certainly both good and bad things about <em>Shattered Space</em> worth highlighting, it’s clear the polarized reactions are in part a response to poor expectation-setting and hopes around the expansion not just adding to the game but also feeling fundamentally different from the familiar Bethesda RPG formula that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-rpg-fallout-starfield-skyrim-elder-scrolls-1850809428">creaked and strained under the weight of<em> Starfield</em>’s ambition</a></span>.</p><p>This is far from the end of the road for the Xbox console exclusive though.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Game Pass Day One Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This is in keeping with tradition for Activision and Nvidia, as 2023's Modern Warfare III also streamed through GeForce Now, as did the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta earlier this year. Call of Duty: Warzone is also available to stream through GeForce Now.</p><p>When Microsoft was in the process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, one of the sticking points was cloud-gaming rights. To appease regulators, Microsoft worked out a deal with Nvidia (and others) to bring future titles like Black Ops 6 to streaming services beyond Microsoft's own Xbox cloud gaming. Speaking of which, Microsoft is yet to confirm if Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox cloud gaming.</p><h2><strong>What is GeForce Now?</strong></h2><p>GeForce Now is Nvidia's game-streaming service, and it's available throughout North America and Europe. Instead of needing a beefy rig or game console to play games locally, GeForce Now streams games from a powerful PC at Nvidia's server farm, running on GeForce RTX 4080 SuperPODs. Nvidia says those who subscribe to the highest, most expensive tier ($20/month) will get the best frame rates and visual fidelity, including ray-tracing. According to Nvidia, the experience is indistinguishable from playing locally--but of course that depends on the quality and consistency of your internet connection.</p><h2><strong>How to play Black Ops 6 on GeForce Now</strong></h2><p>First, you must own a copy of Black Ops 6 on Steam or Battle.net. Then, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a GeForce Now plan</a> and link your account. The cheapest plan is free, but it limits you to one hour of game time per day, has ads, and streams your game from a basic rig. The <strong>Priority </strong>membership ($10/month) gets you a premium rig with RTX on, priority access to servers, six hours of game time per day, up to 1080p/60fps, and no ads. Then there is the <strong>Ultimate </strong>package ($20/month) that streams from a RTX 4080 rig with exclusive access to 4080 servers, eight hours of daily game time, up to 4K/240fps, and no ads.</p><p>There are also Priority and Ultimate day passes available for $4 and $8, respectively.</p><h2><strong>Is Nvidia GeForce Now actually a good experience?</strong></h2><p>Given game-streaming technologies are relatively new, many might be wondering if GeForce Now is actually a good way to play Black Ops 6 or any of the other 1,500+ supported games. Reviews from sites like <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Mag</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-now-review-2023-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC World</a> are very positive about the service. Of course, though, your mileage may vary. You can see the hardware and internet speed requirements below, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/system-reqs/#windows-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Nvidia.</a></p><h3>Hardware Requirements</h3><ul><li>A 64-bit version of Windows 7 or later (32-bit versions of Windows are not supported)</li><li>Dual core x86 or x64 CPU at 2.0GHz or faster</li><li>4GB of system memory</li><li>GPU that supports DirectX 11 or later</li></ul><h3>Internet Requirements</h3><ul><li>15 Mbps for HD resolutions at up to 60 FPS (e.g. 1280x720)</li><li>25 Mbps for FHD resolutions at 60 FPS (e.g. 1920x1080)</li><li>35 Mbps for UW QHD &amp; QHD resolutions at 120 FPS (e.g. 3840x1440 or 2560x1440)</li><li>45 Mbps for 4K resolutions at 120 FPS (e.g. 3840x2160)</li></ul><p>Nvidia said it recommends a hardwired Ethernet connection or a router with a 5 GHz WiFi connection for the best results. Also worth noting is that GeForce Now will only work for you if there is less than 80ms of network latency between you and a Nvidia data center. Here's <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5224" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to test your network for GeForce Now.</a></p><p>On the control side, Nvidia said it recommends a USB gaming mouse for the best experience. GeForce Now also supports Xbox and PlayStation controllers, along with a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/recommended/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">range of other gamepads.</a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about Black Ops 6. </a></p>

            <p>"Turn-based" games are, as we know, all derived from Turn, the strategy game about a dog digging for coins released for the BBC Micro in 1987. Prior to this, all actions in games simply took place simultaenously, as fast as the player or players could make them. 
</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and many games are now "turn-based", from Tactics Ogre Reborn to Age Of Wonders 4 to chess. In celebration of their orderliness, Steam is currently running a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">turn-based RPG fest</a> featuring discounts and demos for "turn-based games where you grow stronger with every battle".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is 40% reduced, Age Of Wonders 4 is 35% discounted, the recently released Tactical Breach Wizards is 10% off, Octopath Traveller 2 has been slashed by 40%, and XCOM2 is an absurd 95% taken-offed. I'll stop there because I'm obviously out of synonyms for "on sale".
</p>
<p>These genre specific Fests tend to attract fewer pre-release demos than other Steam events, particularly this close to the more demo-centric Next Fest, which happens in a couple of weeks. The most downloaded demos of the fest so far are recent releases such as Multiverse Loot Hunter and Backpack Battles, and recent-ish staples like Dragon Quest 11 S and the aforementioned Octopath Traveller 2.
</p><p>Still, browsing the menu did introduce me to Silence Of The Siren, which released in Early Access just a few days ago. It's from the developers of Project Hospital and it's a sci-fi strategy game in the vein of Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic. Looks neat! You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/">grab the demo from its store page</a>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/turnbased_rpg">Turn-Based Fest</a> runs from now until October 7th. Turn developer Stephen "Turn" Turner would be proud.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But who can blame them when you have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04537975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04537975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exclusive skateboard decks from Amiami</a></span> that are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04537974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=GOODS-04537974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as gorgeous as these two</a></span>?</p><p>Both decks feature artistic representations of Sora and Roxas—the franchise’s two main characters throughout the years—with story-specific keywords coming together to create their hair and clothing. They’re unique and eye-catching on both sides, with the top of the Sora board featuring intricate emblems and symbols reminiscent of tribal artwork, and grim bone art on Roxas’.</p><p>These two boards, made of Canadian Maple, are meant for something other than riding. They’re showpieces designed to hang on your wall or sit on a shelf. But you’d still be the best person ever if you decided to screw that, and slap on some trucks and wheels.</p><p>There’s a catch with these two unique skateboard decks, however. They’re limited and exclusive, meaning you can only buy one of each deck per household, and they’re relatively expensive at nearly $200 when converted from Japanese Yen to USD—that’s significantly more than, say, Santa Cruz’s recent collab with <em>Pokémon</em>, although perhaps there’s slightly less chance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-santa-cruz-skateboards-deck-blind-bag-gold-1850874741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-santa-cruz-skateboards-deck-blind-bag-gold-1850874741">their resale value hitting the highs of $20,000</a></span>.</p><p>Furthermore, it’s important to note that these are currently pre-orders. The official release date for each skateboard deck is listed as sometime in January 2025, though the retailer—Amiami—does not provide a more specific date. Lastly, the store does warn that shipping costs may increase due to the size and weight of the package. Given it’s coming from Japan, international shipping costs must be considered. You’re looking at far more than $200 per deck, but then perhaps you’d consider that a price worth paying for a unique board based on your favorite game series?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
