But sandwiched between the game’s four quarters was a spectacular performance by rapper Kendrick Lamar. Lamar’s performance transcended sports circles and was the talk of the internet last night. For most, it was a final nail in the coffin of the rapper’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972">highly-publicized beef with Canadian rapper Drake</a></span>, but it also had a lot of commentary on the state of America, with President Donald Trump in the audience.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s get the collective cultural catharsis out of the way first. The viral moment of the show was Lamar performing his now five-time Grammy-winning song “Not Like Us.” The song is one of many Lamar released during a public feud with Drake back in 2024, and has become a cultural phenomenon. With over a billion streams and multiple clips of entire crowds performing it (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including the Grammy’s audience</a></span>), millions of people are celebrating a song that accuses Drake of being a culture vulture pedophile in reference to years of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of grooming young women</a></span> in the entertainment industry. The song is a scathing diss on its own, but when it goes on to become a record-breaking, award-winning hit, that’s when you know you’ve lost the rap battle.</p><p>Lamar’s performance of “Not Like Us” was a big moment for the show in a few ways. At the midpoint of the show, Lamar had a brief intermission with some of the show’s dancers, during which he said he wanted to “perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” while the instrumental “No Like Us” briefly played. This was seemingly a reference to Drake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple lawsuits regarding the song</a></span>, and at first, it seemed to imply that Lamar was barred from playing it at the show. He then transitioned into a medley of “Luther” and “All the Stars” featuring the immaculate R&amp;B singer SZA, my queen, and it seemed like that was it. Lamar would omit his biggest hit seemingly to avoid further controversy…until about three minutes later, when he went to chat with his dancers one more time, said this was “bigger than the music,” and that someone “tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Again, this was seemingly about Drake’s lawsuit trying to muzzle the song’s cultural impact.</p><p>Then he starts rapping and the crowd goes wild. In Super Bowl halftime shows, artists have to trim down their songs to maybe a minute or two, and the section of “Not Like Us” Lamar chose to perform is the most explicitly aimed at Drake, even calling him out by name. One popular meme is the point when Lamar looks into the camera with a devilish, shit-eating grin and says, “Hey Drake, I hear you like ‘em young.” The word “pedophile” was left out of the song, replaced by a wordless shout in the live show, but he still had the entire Caesars Superdome crowd singing along to, “Trying to strike a chord and it’s probably A Minor.” Fatality.</p><p>Lamar’s cocky strut while he smiles into the camera became an instant meme, but the entire show was a victory lap in a year-long campaign to bury Drake.</p><p>Hopefully not lost in the sauce is that this was also a commentary on the state of the United States and its attempts to silence Black voices. Samuel L. Jackson made multiple appearances during the show as the U.S. propaganda character Uncle Sam. He starts off emphasizing that the Super Bowl is “The Great American Game,” followed by Lamar rapping the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GNX </em>teaser</a></span> that was released before his latest album, but has yet to be put on streaming services. However, he included a new lyric: “The revolution about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This was seemingly a dig at fear-mongering President Donald Trump, who was in the audience but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left during the second half</a></span>.</p><p>Uncle Sam returns after Lamar performs “Squabble Up,” one of his more rap-heavy tracks, and calls it “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto.” Then Lamar’s dancers, dressed in red, white and blue, arrange themselves to look like the American flag while he raps. Uncle Sam shows up a few more times to berate Lamar for not playing up what America believes the Super Bowl to be about. After the SZA medley, Sam appears one more time to say that “nice and calm” melodic songs are “what America wants.” He then proceeds to drag Drake across an entire football field. . As incredible as it was to see Drake get bodied on the biggest stage possible, this was a critique of the current state of America and the country’s history of policing Black art and voices. A lot of fans are hoping the overarching message of the show isn’t lost.</p><p>Lamar has had an incredible year and isn’t slowing down. Both he and SZA are preparing to embark on a co-headlining tour starting in April, and after seeing this show I might be about to buy tickets. Stream <em>GNX</em> and also SZA’s <em>Lana</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New updates for Phasmophobia aren’t ending anytime soon as developer Kinetic Games has released its planned roadmap for 2025.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Kinetic went into details on what Phasmophobia players can expect throughout the year. That includes two major updates, new maps and reworks, and seasonal events.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first major update is called Chronicle. This update is a revamp to how evidence is recorded during your hunt such as replacing the Photos tab with a Media tab that captures photos, videos, and sound.</p>



<p>“Chronicle will also bring with it a few extra bits aside from what we’ve mentioned, but we’re keeping those a secret until we’re closer to launch,” they said while pointing to a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prior development diary</a> with more information.</p>



<p>Regarding player characters, the studio is “refreshing character models, improving animations and adjusting the overall experience when it comes to your Phasmophobia character.” A planned full character customization feature is being pushed to 2026 to allow focus on the Horror 2.0 update. </p>



<h2 id="h-more-map-changes-are-coming">More Map Changes Are Coming</h2>



<p>Moving on to the map changes coming this year, Kinetic Games is reworking 6 Tanglewood Drive, Bleasdale Farmhouse and Grafton Farmhouse. Bleasdale will be released first in March with the other two reworks coming later this year.</p>



<p>“These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them,” the developers said. “So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however.”</p>



<p>There will also be a new small map added to the game.  The studio says that all future maps will be “relatively small”  in order to push out new maps more frequently.</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-2025">Beyond 2025</h2>



<p>Despite the latest updates being about 2025, Kinetic Games is also focused on the future of Phasmobia, including what’s to come in 2026. The studio is working on its major Horror 2.0 update for the year that includes more new maps and reworks. Details on all of that will come later on, though no timeframe was given.</p>



<p>What do you think of the 2025 roadmap for Phasmophobia? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Might Be Cracking Down on ‘Shovelware’ Spam Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-might-be-cracking-down-on-%E2%80%98shovelware%E2%80%99-spam-games.1105041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In recent months, digital storefronts across all gaming platforms have seemingly become inundated with AI-generated games, ‘shovelware’, and rip-off titles. Many games that make it to these storefronts are questionable at best, boasting copy-and-paste assets, paltry mechanics, and rinse-and-repeat content.</p>



<p>IGN carried out a recent investigation into the state of the quality assurance processes protecting these storefronts, focusing most specifically on PlayStation and Nintendo stores. It was noticed in the last couple of days that some of these ‘spam games’ have been silently stripped from the PS5 store.</p>



<p>Are we about to witness a mass exodus of shovelware games from our digital stores?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-churn-them-out">Churn Them Out</h2>



<p>PlayStation users were complaining about a shovelware epidemic on the platform’s digital storefronts <strong>years ago</strong>. It’s a problem that has been brewing for a while, but it peaked recently with an investigation that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carried out by IGN</a>. It seems that QA processes are slacking, encouraging ‘developers’ to push dozens of asset-flip, AI-generated games to storefronts.</p>



<p>PS4 and PS5 users have noticed the vast amounts of shovelware winding up in their search results – and some developers are standing out as the key culprits.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RandomSpin Games</a>, which releases multiple ‘games’ a month, all of which are low-effort, mostly pointless creations. <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/breakthrough-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breakthrough Gaming</a> is another name. This developer was releasing two or three ‘RPG’ games a month at its peak. How about <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/zakym" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zakym</a>, which in the last five or six weeks has released around a <strong>dozen games</strong> – you can likely imagine how bad they all are.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> noticed today that stacks of titles from RandomSpin Games, one of the biggest offenders on PlayStation, have been removed on the DL. It hasn’t been highlighted <strong>why </strong>they’ve been removed, but it <strong>could be </strong>a knock-on impact from IGN’s investigation, and PlayStation’s store operators are getting wiser about these deceptive practices.</p>



<p>Now, what will they do about the ‘scam’ copies that pop up, like the fake Black Myth game or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/">rip-off version of The Last of Us</a> on Nintendo Switch? </p>

                <p>Valve has seemingly introduced new rules that ban games that require users to watch paid ads (or rely on other such ad-based revenue models) from Steam. However, some sources report that these rules may have already existed, and that Valve has merely created <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="nofollow">a dedicated page</a> on Steamworks to clarify this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">The page explains that Steam does not contain paid advertising, and that advertising-based revenue models are not allowed on the platform. It further states that developers are also prohibited from using advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players an in-game reward for watching or engaging with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rule reads in part. "If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam."</p><p dir="ltr">This apparent change in Valve policy was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" rel="nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="nofollow">SteamDB</a> posted screencaps on BlueSky that seem to show that this policy has been in effect for at least five years on a different page, and that this new page is a dedicated space for it that states it in a different way. Regardless, Valve did recently introduce a significant change to its storefront: warnings that note if a game in Early Access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iibeow/steam_now_warns_about_early_access_that_have_not/" rel="nofollow">hasn't been updated</a> in more than a year. These alerts are ostensibly intended to inform users that the development timeline described on a game's page might not have come to fruition, or if the game has been outright abandoned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>

Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>

It’s an interesting read, though there’s no news.</p><p>📺 Earlier this month, the company added the ability for developers to <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/video-uploads-beta-add-short-form-video-to-your-experience/2630621">include short videos into their experiences</a>. I worry this feature could be used for bad, but the company says videos must adhere to its community standards.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NDg3NzM=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921001/roblox-employees-return-to-office-metaverse-isnt-good-enough">Roblox says employees must return to office because the metaverse still isn’t good enough</a></h2><div><p>Roblox — a company that builds a hugely popular virtual experiences platform, recently introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864026/roblox-connect-video-chat">its own spin on video chat</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827740/roblox-virtual-career-center-job-interviews">even created an in-<em>Roblox</em> career center</a> — is “transitioning away” from remote work and will be asking “a number of our remote employees to begin working from our headquarters in San Mateo by next summer,” CEO David Baszucki wrote in an email to staff <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2023/10/future-work-together-roblox/">shared publicly on Tuesday</a>.</p><p>Like many other companies, Roblox will be shifting to a model where employees are expected to work three days in the office (Tuesday through Thursday). Staffers will have until January 16th, 2024, to decide if they want to stay on at the company under the new rules. If an employee chooses to stay at Roblox and relocate, the company will help with relocation costs and expects them to report into the company’s San Mateo, California, offices by July 15th, 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921001/roblox-employees-return-to-office-metaverse-isnt-good-enough">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Roblox is now available on PlayStation.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>The CEO of Bumble says that the metaverse is “kind of contrary to everything I believe in in terms of getting humans to look each other in the eye.”</p><p>Roblox CEO David Baszucki thinks people <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/8/23864858/roblox-ceo-prediction-adults-dating-experiences-rdc-2023">will be dating in Roblox</a>, but at Code 2023, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd doesn’t sound like a fan of that idea. “Maybe that is how people will originally connect,” she said, but noted that “I will be much more sad for humanity than myself if people just stop really meeting in real life.”</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I asked David Baszucki about the potential of interoperability between different virtual worlds platforms.</p><p>The short answer seems to be no. But in his response, he talked a lot about file formats and how they might differ for things like a pair of virtual shoes and wheels that fall off a virtual car. That might make any interchangeability would be a tricky problem to solve; companies like Roblox, Meta, and Epic Games would have to agree on file formats that could sync across systems. My sense is they might be reticent to do that right now.</p></div></li></ul><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23864790/roblox-news-announcements-updates/archives/2"><span>More Stories</span></a></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Major reworks, new ghost-hunting tools, seasonal events, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Kinetic Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> has announced the 2025 roadmap for four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [230 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> psychological <a title="Genres > Horror [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Phasmophobia [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a></em>, including major reworks, new ghost-hunting tools, seasonal events, and a new map. The Early Access version of the game has also sold over two million units across <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,803 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [227 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, 104 days after its console launch. <span id="more-942984"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the upcoming updates, via Kinetic Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>First Major Update: “Chronicle”</strong></p><p>The first major update, “Chronicle,” will bring changes to the journal and rework the way in which Ghost Hunters can capture evidence. The Photos tab will be replaced with a Media tab featuring three new sections—Photos, Videos, and Sound Recordings—with any photographic, audio, or visual evidence logged in the corresponding pages. </p><p>The game’s media quality system is being replaced too, with a players’ first “capture” of any media type labelled as “Unique.” These will reward lots of cash and XP at the end of a contract, while “duplicates” will reward much less.</p><p>Chronicle will also introduce the Sound Recorder, a brand new piece of equipment designed to record unique paranormal sounds. Players brave enough to do so will be able to listen back to their recordings in the updated journal, letting them discover helpful clues that may previously have been drowned out by terrified screams.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Players will be able to explore a garden just outside the main living room, complete with ghost rooms, as well as revamped areas to explore. Grafton Farmhouse will also receive an update later this year.</p><p><strong>More to Come</strong></p><p>There’s even more to come, with a player character overhaul, new small map, and updates for the Easter, Halloween and Holiday seasons set to arrive in 2025. Plans for 2026 are already underway too, with house map reworks, even more new maps, and Horror 2.0 in the works.</p></blockquote><p>“We’re beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to <em>Phasmophobia</em> this year,” said Kinetic Games director and <em>Phasmophobia</em> lead developer Daniel Knight in a press release. “Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we’re making are a direct reflection of the feedback we’re seeing. We’re really proud of the direction <em>Phasmophobia</em> is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can’t wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025.”</p><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, Xbox Series, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the weekend, the game reached its current record of 256,206 concurrent players before settling back down to 188,000 players today. Regardless, the upwards trajectory of this title is impressive and it appears to still have room to grow. The game is also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, so the Steam numbers may only represent a small part of the overall picture.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has also been highly rated on GameSpot's sister site, Metacritic, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 88</a>.

<p>The Photos tab will be replaced with a media tab that encapsulates not just polaroid images, but also videos and sound recordings, too, with your first "capture" of any media deemed "Unique".</p>
<p>Also on the cards is a complete rework of Bleasdale Farmhouse (good; I <em>always</em> die there) with "visual enhancements and a complete redesign of the layout, including new locations for ghosts to haunt".</p>

<p>Interestingly, this map will also encompass a new outdoor space just beyond the living room.</p>
<p>The game's other terrifying farmhouse, Grafton, is also getting updated later this year.</p>
<p>"We're beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to Phasmophobia this year," said Daniel "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we're making are a direct reflection of the feedback we're seeing.</p>
<p>"We're really proud of the direction Phasmophobia is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can't wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-is-getting-more-expensive-later-today">Phasmophobia's price was bumped from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) last September</a>, with the team saying the price hike was due to "the amount of content and playtime added to the game since Early Access started almost four years ago".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-at-the-end-of-the-world.1104993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article contains some spoilers for the ending of </em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</p><p>Over the past few months, I’ve picked up a nasty habit that I swore I’d kicked for good: I wake up in the morning, immediately pick up my glowing rectangle, and scroll social media to see what fresh horrors await.</p><p>It’s a terrible compulsion that <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve repeatedly condemned</a>, and the hypocrisy is not lost on me. The shame of not practicing what I preach is outweighed only by the quotidian psychic damage this habit inflicts, keeping me in a state of fearful paralysis. Sadness and rage make my body limp, and I end up exactly where our oppressors want us: caught in a loop of irreverent posting and passive info consumption, instead of organizing against them.</p><p>Everything about the current media environment is engineered to keep us stuck on this hamster wheel, but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier to log off. It’s hard to disconnect completely knowing climate change-fueled wildfires have burned down Los Angeles, or that<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the richest dweeb on Earth is sending Nazi children</a> to dismantle every branch of the US government except the parts that kill and imprison people. Even so, if we don’t learn to step away from all this nonsense, we’ll never be able to imagine anything better or do the hard work to make it a reality.</p><p>One of my few sources of respite during all this has been playing <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, a game that feels uncannily suited to our current moment in history. It’s a timely reminder that we need fantasy, daydreaming, and time away from the noxious doomcloud of discourse if we want anything to change. If we’re truly witnessing the twilight of American empire, fantasy can show us a new world that lies beyond it—but only if we’re willing to log off and put in the work.</p><hr><p>There are two real-world events that will always define my 100+ hours playing Atlus’<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metaphor-refantazio-is-the-future-of-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> much-praised JRPG</a>: the passing of legendary filmmaker David Lynch, and the re-election of Donald Trump as the most powerful psychopath on Earth. This feels weird to type out, given that <em>Metaphor</em> is a fantasy roleplaying game and Trump and Lynch are two real people who exist on opposite poles of the same unreality. One is the ultimate id, a craven narcissist who uses untruth and delusion as weapons to divide and rule; the other taps the realms of fantasy and the subconscious as a guide, his works reminding us to trust our intuition and discover truths hidden deep within the self.</p><p>I felt the long shadows of both men as I played through <em>Metaphor</em>’s six story arcs, along with a lingering feeling that the game’s creators bit off more than they could chew. For the most part, the game drives home its timely themes thanks to a vividly imagined world and some relatable and deeply-written characters. But for a story about “the power of fantasy,” <em>Metaphor</em>’s final thesis still left me feeling a bit empty.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em>’s director Katsura Hashino<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/anxiety-is-the-ultimate-monsters-says-metaphor-refantazio-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has said that the game is about anxiety</a>, a theme he couldn’t have picked a better time in modern history to explore, given the state of everything. More specifically, it’s about how anxiety can turn us into monsters, and the existential question of how we as individuals and a society should deal with it. After all, anxiety is the price we pay for our existence as a sentient species, and all that <em>agita</em> has gotta go somewhere.</p><figure></figure><p>The game’s bleak world shows us how this dilemma can lead down some very dark paths. The most powerful people in <em>Metaphor</em>’s world all offer different solutions to the problem of anxiety, all of which lead to chaos, stagnation, and/or ruin. The late King, whose murder spurs the events of the game, believed the power of government authority could ease everyone’s burdens, using a mystical sceptre that lets him <em>quite literally</em> absorb the people’s anxiety in the form of magic. But in doing so he becomes frail and crestfallen, a puppet-like figurehead of a dying nation who has long since given up on his ideals.</p><p>Exploiting this power vacuum are the game’s two main antagonists. Sanctifex Forden, the leader of the powerful Sanctist Church, would have the people pour their anxieties into a corrupt, racist, and highly-stratified state religion, promising salvation in exchange for their blind faith and obedience. Louis, the smooth-talking bishounen Big Bad, takes the Nietszchean position: Under his Reddit libertarian-esque new world order, these corrupt institutions would be destroyed and “true equality” achieved by forcing people to harness their own anxieties and seize<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the will to power</a>—the ultimate survival-of-the-fittest where the strong survive and the weak die.</p><p>Our heroes, meanwhile, seek another path, forged by unlocking one’s inner power and using it to help and protect others. Just like the <em>Persona</em> games that preceded it, <em>Metaphor</em> borrows these concepts from the work of psychologist Carl Jung, who was all about confronting the deepest parts of the self as a way to achieve personal and societal enlightenment. But to me, the game even more strongly evokes the late David Lynch.</p><hr><p>In Hollywood, Lynch was as rare as they come. The celebrated creator of surrealist mysteries like <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <em>Blue Velvet</em>, and <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, he’s one the few artists whose work always seems to be a true and honest reflection of himself and what he believes in. His films are the kind that can only come from a person who is constantly in deep dialogue with their inner self—scouring the depths of their subconscious for hidden truths, rather than waiting for someone or something external to give the answers. In this sense, <em>Metaphor</em> is definitively Lynchian.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, I’m a bit of a Lynch fangirl—and whatever the opposite of that is for Trump. If Trump’s brand of fascism represents the darkest pits of depravity that fear and anxiety can drive us to, Lynch’s works point to the dual nature of these forces. His films show how mystery—the sublime beauty of the unknown—can evoke a positive kind of anxiety based in curiosity, intuition, and a desire for personal and collective growth.&nbsp;</p><p>This idea of anxiety having the potential to create change for good or ill is the core of <em>Metaphor</em>’s story. Like previous Atlus games, it takes these philosophical concepts and embeds them into the story and gameplay mechanics. When characters awaken to their anxiety-fueled powers, they do so by ripping out their own heart and screaming a declaration of their will into it like a microphone. The powers themselves are “Archetypes,” a term coined by Jung to describe the characteristic patterns that repeat in different people throughout history. Anxiety is also a status effect in <em>Metaphor</em>, notably the only one that can be triggered by things beyond status-inflicting attacks in combat, like being surprised by the enemy or taking too much damage before your first press turn.</p><p>In Lynch’s work,&nbsp; the good things in life glow bright because of the dark, and remind us how easily darkness can consume everything if we don’t find and confront it within ourselves while pursuing the light. He embraces ambiguity and often avoids neatly-wrapped conclusions, showing us how the search for truth can bring us together in shared purpose, even when life refuses to give us satisfying answers. In the end, the journey is always worth it, as long as we keep working and stay true to our ideals.</p><p>Which brings me back to my bad social media habits.</p><p>When you’re lying in bed scrolling through an endless firehose of news, it often feels like you’re afflicted with an Anxiety stat debuff. You know it’s bad, but you can’t shake the feeling that you’re missing one piece of a puzzle—that if you just find the <em>right</em> piece of information, you’ll finally have what you need to start making sense of things. Or at very least, to prepare for things getting worse.</p><p>But the fact is, we already have enough information. No amount of posting or scrolling is going to give us that missing piece. What we need to do is to decide what truth we believe in, embrace the unknown, and take action to manifest our truth into a better world.</p><hr><p>Unless you majorly fuck something up along the way, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> ends with both of the main villains defeated, the king’s sceptre destroyed, and our protagonist leading the nation of Euchronia on a slow but steady march toward a better future. Progress doesn’t happen overnight, the game repeatedly reminds us, but we need to stick to our ideals and believe that change is possible.</p><p>Many of us need to hear this right now, but it was still frustrating to me that the story ends essentially right back where it began: with a country ruled over by a powerful king, albeit a beneficent one with a much brighter disposition. As the credits rolled, I pondered what David Lynch might say about this conclusion—the way it ties things together with a neatly wrapped bow, rather than giving us space to imagine other possibilities. In <em>Twin Peaks: The Return</em>, Monica Belucci tells Lynch’s character Gordon Cole, “We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives inside the dream”—so why not dream a little bigger?&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the whole game, it feels like the townsfolk are all simply waiting to hear what fate the Important People have in store for them. Gaining the support of the people is a big part of the story, and many of the supporters and friends you meet along the way have some great character-building moments as they learn to take control of their anxieties and forge a path forward in their own lives. But ultimately, the macro-scale political problems of the world are all on the shoulders of you and your merry band.</p><figure></figure><p>Fuck that. Even if the entire kingdom is cheering me as their savior, why is it always up to one Good Person and their team of elite do-gooders to save the world? In our world, our leaders have failed us, and there’s no revolutionary vanguard. No one is coming to save us. It’s up to all of us, collectively, to organize and do the work. And despite what the social media doomscroll would have you believe, that work is happening all around us every day.</p><p>The examples are endless. We saw during the Los Angeles wildfires how people sprung into action to create mutual aid distribution hubs for the displaced and the unhoused. In New York City, large networks of veteran organizers dispatch volunteers multiple times a week to keep watch for ICE raids and protect our most vulnerable neighbors from Trump’s deportation machine. Other organizers provided food and warm clothes to migrants after cities closed shelters in freezing temperatures. Others have mobilized to provide legal and material aid to transgender people after a rapid series of illegal Executive Orders claimed to strip them of their rights.&nbsp;</p><p>A better world is possible not because of the actions of a few heroic people, but because neighbors organize and help each other, building local power to sustain their communities where the government has failed. Organizers are doing this in every town and city. Some of them have been doing it for decades.</p><p>To be clear, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is an entertainment product made by a large corporation. I held no illusions that it was going to present the gaming public with a collectivist vision of a world beyond capitalism, and from the get-go it seemed clear that the utopia <em>Metaphor</em>’s characters are striving for is essentially a progressive / neoliberal status quo. But maybe that wasn’t the point.</p><p>To paraphrase<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AJ3RVFGnwFw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the great Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, no government lasts for forever. Empires can be unmade, giving way to a new world that—while still imperfect—can seem like fantasy to those who came before. But this better world is not preordained. It’s not something we wait to see happen—it’s something all of us create every day.</p><p>At the beginning and end of the game, <em>Metaphor</em> asks the player if fantasy can change reality, but fantasies are fleeting unless they walk in lockstep with action. If we truly want to manifest our ideals, we can’t keep chasing headlines and hot takes while waiting for someone else to fix things. We need to log off, learn to trust ourselves and each other, and commit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NVMeVB5Q-Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing the work</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/trump-tariff-china-ugreen-max5c-noise-canceling-headphones"><h3>These Headphones Were A Great Deal When I Bought Them</h3></a><p>The Ugreen Max5c were an absolute steal when I got them for about $35 dollars, but I have no clue how long that'll be true.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the newer features added to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iteration</a> of Sid Meier's Civilization is the inclusion of Crisis Events. This also includes Crisis Policies, which are held on the same page as the Social Policies that you can choose for your empire. If you're getting stuck in Civilization 7 and aren't sure what the Crisis Events have in store for you, this guide will explain everything you need to know about Crisis Policies and the Crisis Events themselves in Civilization 7.</p>
<p>For more Civilization 7, check out our other guides.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">How to Disperse an Independent Power</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-raise-settlement-cap-in-civilization-7/">How To Raise Settlement Cap&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are Crisis Policies?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>For every unique Crisis Event in Civilization 7 comes a unique set of Crisis Policies that you will have to choose between. While some of them may seem like they could be beneficial, a lot of the time, the negative effects of the Policies will be very obvious during your playthrough. The Crisis Policies exist to try and help mitigate the dangers of the ongoing crisis rather than help to resolve it entirely. There will be some difficult choices you'll have to make, and as the Crisis evolves, you'll have to choose more Crisis Policies.</p>
<h2>What are Crisis Events in Civilization 7?</h2>
<p>Crisis Events happen through the Antiquity and Exploration Age typically, where you can have anything from a nonstop invasion to the Plague ravaging your empire and nearby cities. Unfortunately, you&nbsp;<strong>cannot stop</strong> these events from happening. They are guaranteed to happen, but it may just take a while for them to happen. Below are the events that could happen in the Antiquity Age and Exploration Age, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Revolts</strong> - The rising unhappiness of your population has reached an all-time high. Your settlements go into open revolt, and they want to tear you down.</p>
<p><strong>Invasion</strong> - Independent Powers will begin to overwhelm your lands and assault your troops and cities. You'll need a strong military for this one.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The plague is self-explanatory but can be incredibly difficult to handle during this age, as there are minimal medical breakthroughs at this point.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Exploration Age there are two different events that can happen in the Exploration Age, but the Plague can also happen here, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wars of Religion</strong> - Nations begin to spread their religions, but this leads to conflict between different religions that believe in their own tenets. You can choose whether or not you think tolerance of other beliefs can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution</strong> - The Bourgeoisie and the middle class begin to rise up and ask for a change in power, which shocks the noble people. You have the option to dampen their revolution efforts or lead a Revolutionary Government.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The Plague can also happen in the Exploration Age. There are more ways to handle it, such as having Medical staff available during this time, but it is significantly more dangerous and more contagious.</p>
<p>While you can't prevent the Crisis Events from happening, if you were to start a new Civilization 7 game, you can <strong>choose to toggle them off</strong>, so you don't have to deal with them in a new playthrough.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is offering users <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">a new way to block people</a> without the confrontational nature of an actual block. The new feature, called Ignore, is essentially a mute function that can hide annoying or abusive users without attracting unwanted attention — thus avoiding unnecessary anxiety or flare-up drama.</p><p>You can apply the new Ignore feature by going to a user’s profile, tapping the triple-dot menu, and selecting Ignore (in the same menu where Block can be found). Once you activate it, you’ll no longer see that user’s profile and messages, and you will see less of them across Discord, as it will mute their notifications and activity, including in server message notifications (in other words, alerts). However, the big distinction is that, unlike with a Block, Ignore will still let them see your profile and activity and allow them to send you messages (which you won’t know about unless you unhide them). But they will be none-the-wiser about their Ignore status.</p><p>Discord says it’s adding Ignore to its safety “toolbox” to give users, especially teens, more discreet ways to take space from others without making situations scary. Discord is also joining OpenAI, Google, Roblox, and others in establishing a non-profit foundation called ROOST, which will offer open-source technology for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to various organizations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There were commercials about Meg Ryan having orgasms at a restaurant with Billy Crystal (a la <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>), Gordon Ramsay and Pete Davidson hanging with alien cookware, and Post Malone drinking beer while acting like...Post Malone. My argument is: If brands are willing to spend an NFL player’s salary on a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it commercial, then why not fork over $40 million more and produce some high quality TV?</p><p>From Matthew McConaughey spouting “foodball”-related conspiracy theories to Michael Shannon and Aubrey Plaza being unimpressed by everything in life, here are the 11 Super Bowl LIX commercials that need to become TV shows.</p></div></div><div><p>You could put Glen Powell in a jet (<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), the path of a tornado (<em>Twisters</em>), or a lethal relationship (<em>Hit Man</em>), and he’s going to make you want to watch all of it. So, him donning a blonde wig as the most adrenaline-fueled version of Goldilocks ever in the Ram Trucks Super Bowl commercial was a thrill ride I didn’t want to end. What if he had a lighthearted but high-stakes anthology series where he’s a dad trying to connect with the children he has in the commercial by retelling classic children’s stories with him as the action hero? If he’s dodging dragons and riding over volcanoes as Goldilocks, you could easily fill 15 episodes of him saving Hansel and Gretel from that cannibalistic old witch with an AK-47, or dressing up as one of the three little pigs to interrogate the captured wolf in order to find out the location of his fellow wolves so they can exact revenge. CBS, put this show on after <em>Tracker</em>. </p></div><div><p>Michael Shannon and Aubrey Plaza are a match made in sarcastic heaven as they try to stop delicious RITZ crackers from breaking their veneer of perpetual dissatisfaction. While the concept gets a couple of chuckles for the ad’s 31 seconds, I’d love to see Plaza and Shannon in a TV series where they realize life is too short to hate everything, so they employ Bad Bunny to try to introduce them to things to make them happy, and despite his best efforts, he fails more often than he succeeds. Imagine Shannon and Plaza’s stone-faced reactions to skydiving, an ayahuasca retreat, and front row seats at a Bad Bunny concert. Cut the check, RITZ.</p></div><div><p>When Harrison Ford talks, I listen. This Jeep Super Bowl commercial was simply 120 seconds of Ford exuding enough captivating cool to be able to speak to America about understanding the cost of freedom like he’s our father. Honestly, that’s the show. Ford living on a farm, riding trucks, and looking directly into our souls every episode as he explains life lessons about the benefits of taking the road less traveled, why we pay taxes, and how to cook eggs when you only have a chicken and sunlight in the woods. Think of it like <em>Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood</em> if it was in the <em>Yellowstone </em>universe.</p></div><div><p>Nostalgia is always in style, especially when it involves a sequel to one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. This Super Bowl LIX commercial revisited <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>’s iconic scene in which Sally (Meg Ryan) proves to Harry (Billy Crystal) that men can’t tell when women are faking orgasms by imitating an orgasm so convincingly in a restaurant full of people that someone famously says, “I’ll have what she’s having.” The only difference is this time, it appears Hellmann’s mayonnaise is <em>actually </em>that pleasurable. The 1989 classic ends with the pair getting married. If, 36 years later, they’ve gotten to the point where some store-bought mayonnaise is the highlight of their night, there could be comedic gold in uncovering the ways this longtime couple tries to keep things spicy, even if it’s just arguing over condiments. </p></div><div><p>People often wonder what they would say or do if they ever met aliens. This HexClad commercial proposes the idea that Gordon Ramsay would be introduced to out-of-this-world cookware, some of which he’s already used. This could be a really limited series (I’m talking four episodes, tops) of Ramsay berating alien chefs who cook intergalactic meals he’s never heard of but can nevertheless judge because his taste is the best in the universe. Unfortunately, with Pete Davidson as the alien ambassador, something is surely going to blow up in Ramsay’s face. </p></div><div><p>A good mockumentary will always make for good TV. The Uber Eats commercial stars Matthew McConaughey as an executive revealing all the ways in which football is a “conspiracy to make us hungry.” Only, plot twist: it’s actually about McConaughey playing himself and pitching Greta Gerwig on a movie about this conspiracy. A movie with McConaughey acting as a zany version of himself, pursuing the making of this passion project and going to great lengths to break down this NFL conspiracy, could be a comedy hit. As ridiculous as some of the claims are (Football being played on Sundays because of ice cream sundaes?), it would be interesting to see what new and wacky coincidences they can come up with while using McConaughey’s hypnotic charm to make them seem somewhat real. Honestly, why else would the Green Bay Packers’ fanbase be known as Cheese Heads?</p></div><div><p> Post Malone and irreverent comedian Shane Gillis being drunk and disorderly troublemakers in a cul-de-sac is a funny enough premise for a Bud Light Super Bowl commerical and a <em>Workaholics</em>-style raunchy comedy. Can you imagine Post Malone day-drinking and playing acoustic versions of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” while Peyton Manning, living next door, is trying to enjoy the silence of retirement? Add in Shane Gills teaching the neighborhood kids how to safely do a keg stand, and you’ve got three seasons of an HBO series. <br></p></div><div><p>I wouldn’t say Booking.com’s Muppet-filled Super Bowl LIX commercial was the best of the night, but it’s probably the most TV-series-ready of them all. The Muppets bouncing around the world trying to find the right vacation spot is cool for a 30-second commercial, but it really makes me want a <em>White Lotus</em>-style comedy. Kermit and Miss Piggy convincing the rest of the gang to spend their summer at an all-inclusive resort, only to find out there’s some shady activities happening right under their noses, is must-see TV. If <em>Bert and Ernie’s Great Adventures </em>can get 52 episodes, <em>The Muppets: White Lotus</em> can get at least enough for a summer. </p></div><div><p>Sure, Instacart gathered the mascots of some of the most popular consumer brands in the world to entice people watching the Super Bowl to get their groceries from them. What they unintentionally did was show us what a cross between <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Night at the Museum</em> could look like. The same excitement you get from seeing how characters from disparate video game franchises might interact in a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style duel can be achieved by seeing what happens when the Kool-Aid Man bursts through a wall and messes up a floor that Mr. Clean spent all day polishing. But, honestly, I just want to see people’s reactions when their groceries go on strike and move away. </p></div><div><p>Let’s be clear: Dunkin’s Super Bowl commerical is very stupid (borderline insultingly stupid). But then, that’s what makes the sight of Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong doing battle with other coffee brands a car wreck of a commercial you don’t want to look away from. As a TV show, the Affleck brothers running multiple Dunkin’ locations while trying to ward off competitors has the same absurdist foundation that made <em>Eastbound and Down </em>irresistible. With guest appearances from Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick, Druski, possibly Matt Damon, and a bunch of others joining the fight, this could be a great late-night binge for the stoner crowd. </p></div><div><p>Anything Walton Goggins does deserves to be on TV, even if it’s just him breaking the fourth wall for a GoDaddy commerical. But, while the man who made a relatable antihero out of a human mutated by radiation in <em>Fallout </em>spends the ad joking about how actors rarely know anything about the professions they pretend to do, I wouldn’t mind a TV show that puts him in an alternate reality where there’s no difference between who you are on TV and who you are in your normal life. People would run up to him to help them stop bank robbers because he played a cop on <em>The Shield</em>, only for those same bank robbers to ask him for help since he also played a thief in <em>Justified</em>. There could be some sentimental overarching message about him having the potential to be anything, or some societal critique on our obsession with stars. Either way, I need Apple TV and the <em>Severance</em> creators to get the scripts going for this one.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds players could not enjoy the recent open beta test 2 over the weekend due to the recent PlayStation Network outage. As compensation, the developers will extend the second week of OBT 2. </p>



<p>The developers had planned to conduct two Open Beta Test 2 sessions, the first between February 6 and 9 and the second between February 13 and 16. However, after the PSN issue hampered the experience during the first week, they decided to extend the second session across all platforms (PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Steam). The extended period for the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test 2 is “Feb. 13, 7 pm PT / Feb. 14, 3 am GMT – Feb. 17, 6:59 pm PT / Feb. 18, 2:59 am GMT.”&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
UK retailer GAME has been slammed by shop staff and store customers for charging £19.99 delivery on small tins containing the latest Pokémon cards, which are in hot demand nationwide.
</p>
<p>
Stock of the new Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Prismatic Evolutions card set is extremely hard to find with many toy shops and supermarkets selling out. But GAME is still taking pre-orders for the set's new £11 Mini Tins - if you stump up a £19.99 delivery fee, which nearly triples your overall purchase price. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer anonymously to protect their jobs, GAME staff say the situation amounts to the chain effectively "scalping" their own supplies, and customers. Employees say they've been left exasperated by the chain's handling of the popular Pokémon cards' release, and had to deal with angry customers left unable to buy the cards in-store on release day. 
</p>
<p>
GAME staff say that too much of the chain's stock of Prismatic Evolutions cards has been put up for sale online, rather in actual GAME stores or concessions. Additionally, staff say, the small amount of stock sent out to GAME shops has also arrived late, meaning customers who popped in on the set's launch day left empty handed - despite staff previously being told that stock would arrive on time. One staff member claimed their store had been sent a single TCG card pack.
</p>
<p>
"We're constantly taking the brunt of abuse from customers and the company itself," one staff member told Eurogamer, saying they felt they had been lied to by bosses after they'd been told to reassure customers their store would get stock on a certain date - only for it not to turn up. 
</p>
<p>
Online, meanwhile, Pokémon card stock such as the £11 Prismatic Evolutions tins is only available to buy with that £19.99 fee - for what the chain is describing as an "Oversized Delivery" that will arrive in three to five working days.
</p>
<p>
GAME typically charges £4.99 for a Standard Delivery, or alternatively you can pay £4.99 to Collect in Store (also both three to five working days). If you really want to splash out, you can spend £11.99 on some items for Next Day Delivery by DPD. 
</p>
<p>
Checking online today, none of these cheaper options are available for the new Pokémon card tins.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>GAME's website does not offer £4.99 Standard Delivery or Collect in Store options for Prismatic Evolutions card tins - only the pricier £19.99 Oversized Delivery option. | <span>Image credit: <cite>GAME / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
So why are these cards an Oversized Delivery? Staff say they have questioned their bosses about the matter - initially thinking it was a mistake - only to be told the decision was deliberate.
</p>
<p>
These Mini Tins (which describe themselves as offering "Pokémon Favourites in the Palm of Your Hand!") are no larger than a smartphone. At the same time, GAME still offers its usual £4.99 Standard Delivery option for much bulkier items - including consoles such as a new PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
GAME staff say they had initially assumed the Oversized Delivery requirement is a mistake, only to be told by bosses that it wasn't, without any further explanation. 
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted GAME for more.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-fall-of-game-no-games-no-accessories-instead-we-received-136-zendaya-action-figures">Eurogamer published a report detailing GAME's ongoing issues</a>, the difficulties faced by shop floor staff amidst store closures, relentless redundancies, and a head office that was failing to deal with stock problems. At the time, staff told us the chain was losing touch with customers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that the upcoming second week of February's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta will be extended thanks to a recent PSN outage that saw many unable to log into PlayStation's online services.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907040879485237" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on X, Capcom says the open beta period, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">set to begin on February 13th</a> (or 14th depending on your timezone), will be extended by 24 hours. That means it'll now be coming to an end on either February 17th or 18th, again dependent on timezone.</p>

<p>If you're a PC or Xbox player, don't worry; the open beta has been extended across all platforms, so even if you weren't directly affected by the outage, you'll still be able to enjoy the game for an extra day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=IrkoceCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-extended-fleeing.jpg?itok=DgdAHT5k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta has been extended by a day.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the extension itself, Capcom has also <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907223285256244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the rewards you'll get for participating in the open beta will remain available for the additional day, so you don't need to miss out on those.</p>

<p>The PSN outage to which Capcom is referring <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/playstation-network-outage-february-2025-live" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">began on Friday evening</a> (Eastern time) and was resolved the following day, meaning PSN was unavailable for around a 24-hour period.</p>

<p>Sony hasn't revealed the reason behind the outage, simply putting it down to an "operational issue" in an apologetic <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on X</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a PlayStation Plus member, then you'll be getting an extra five days of subscription by way of apology. Non-PS Plus members don't get anything, but it looks like it doesn't matter which tier you're subscribed to, at least.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the upcoming next major installment in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. The game will see you sally forth into the Forbidden Lands to investigate rumors of a mysterious monster attacking villages.</p>

<p>Along the way, you will, of course, hunt and kill plenty of monsters, collecting unique gear and discovering a deep ecosystem as you go.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

Hopefully, the outage remains a blip and PlayStation Network service continues without future problems. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA 6) is likely coming to PC, it’s just a matter of when. In a new interview with IGN, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about the game coming to the platform and the decision to not launch on what he calls an “important part” of the business.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Zelnick says, usually, Take-Two’s strategy has not been to release on all platforms at once. Instead, he says, it would start with a console or two before branching out. With GTA 6, that plan appears to be no different as there is a focus on moving more PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series systems with the game’s release.</p>



<p>“When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,” Zelnick said while also mentioning that it’s not always the case to not release on all platforms at once. He pointed to Civilization 7 as an example of a full multi-platform release that includes PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-still-on-track-for-2025-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Still On Track For 2025: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Regarding PC launches, specifically, Zelnick says that the company knows how big the market it. According to the Take-Two boss, PC versions of a game can result in up to 40% of a game’s total sales.  It’s not something that’s lost on him.</p>



<p>“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see that trend continue,” he said. </p>



<p>GTA 6 is currently scheduled to launch this fall on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. The latest update on the game still being on track  sent Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stock to an all-time high</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think GTA 6 will come to PC? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bubble-ghost-remake-reimagines-a-retro-platforming-classic-in-march.1104915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nakama Game Studio and publisher SelectaPlay have announced a release date for&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>, a reimagined version of the cult classic 1987 platformer.</p>

<p>Launching on March 27th,&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a "reimagined, visually captivating gameplay experience" largely based on the 1987 original, although it'll also boast a host of new features to bring it up to speed with modern gaming standards.</p>

<p>These features include new game modes, boss battles, and collectibles, as well as "many more surprises". It sounds like you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>yourself if you want to find out what those surprises are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=ILBGCzH0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bubble-ghost-remake-release-date-level.jpg?itok=yLkhiMU1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>offers a fresh take on a classic platformer.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake</em>'s Story mode will offer over 40 levels to play through, each of which promise "hours of entertainment and challenge", according to the developers.</p>

<p>If you don't fancy playing through the game with its narrative trappings intact, you can instead opt for the Arcade mode, and Challenge and Speedrun modes are available if you're the kind of person who likes to test themselves to their limits.</p>

<p>These aren't the aforementioned surprises, though; Nakama Game Studio promises further game modes you can unlock "for an even more thrilling gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Naturally, the game will feature revamped graphics and sound when compared to its bleepy-bloopy 80s counterpart, and you can also look forward to in-game achievements, so if you're playing the Switch version, you don't have to miss out on that sweet dopamine hit.</p>




<p>As well as the digital versions, <i>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</i>will also be available as a physical release. In North America, you'll be able to get the standard version, but there's also an EU-exclusive Collector's Edition for Switch that packs in some extra goodies.</p>

<p>These include the game itself (of course), as well as a prequel comic, a soundtrack CD, a "selection of stickers", and a special standee. If you love yourself some&nbsp;<em>Bubble Ghost</em>, you'll want to plump for that.</p>

<p><em>Bubble Ghost Remake&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2412240/Bubble_Ghost_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Bubble-Ghost-Remake-2702820.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dawn-of-war-and-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-shares-future-plans.1104912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-future-plans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Relic Entertainment, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes</em>, has announced its plans for the future, and while they're rather vague on the whole, there are some interesting tidbits to pore over.</p>

<p>In a press release, Relic, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">became independent</a> after being sold off by Sega in March last year (sustaining a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/relic-entertainment-layoffs" rel="nofollow">number of layoffs</a> into the bargain), says it's identified three key pillars for its strategy when it comes to the studio's future.</p>

<p>Pillar one involves "deepening commitment to existing titles", which means providing updates and continuing support for Relic's existing games. At the moment, the company is actively supporting strategy titles&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Age of Empires 4</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=UzEe6FaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relic-entertainment-future-plans-company-of-heroes-3-battle.jpg?itok=eAMsoasP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Relic will continue supporting&nbsp;<em>Company of Heroes 3</em>, but it has plans for new games too.</figcaption></figure><p>Relic's second major new pillar is titled "independent development, creative experiences", and it involves the developer branching out into "smaller-scope, in-house games", as well as "continuing to develop the larger, complex strategy titles" for which it's known.</p>

<p>Finally - and perhaps most interestingly - Relic says it wants to "reimagin[e] classics", finding ways to "bring [its] classic titles to modern audiences". This could entail "re-releases, remasters, or brand-new franchise experiences" that capture the originals' "spirit" while appealing to new players as well.</p>

<p>Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell says the studio's new direction marks "a significant milestone", and that he's "confident" Relic will be able to deliver "innovative, high-quality games that resonate with players around the world".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Relic doesn't commit to announcing exactly what any of the aforementioned games might be, so we don't know just how far away from that tantalizing&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster we might be. Let's hope it's just around the corner, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=Z7ptPWPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-relic.jpg?itok=DC8CvpIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let's hope that&nbsp;<em>Dawn of War&nbsp;</em>remaster is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>If you were worried that Relic's independence from Sega meant it wouldn't be able to create its large-scale RTS games anymore, then it looks like you won't need to worry about that. We'll just be getting some extra experiments on the side.</p>

<p>What this means for Relic in a broader sense remains to be seen, though. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Relic-related.</p>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has discussed the growing importance of the PC market, though stopped short of outright confirming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> will be heading to PC.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but there's been no mention of a PC release so far. That's surprising in 2025, when big releases are often released simultaneously across all three platforms, or at least follow up soon with PC.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">IGN</a>, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously".</p>

<p>"So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away," Zelnick said, making comparison with Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. "With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zelnick admitted that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales. As a result, the PC platform is growing in importance.</p>
<p>"We have seen PC become a much more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he said.</p>
<p>Still, the focus for GTA 6 for now are the console releases, which Zelnick expects to boost console sales in response.</p>
<p>"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," Zelnick said.</p>
<p>"And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar '25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."</p>
<p>So why no PC release for GTA 6 at present? As Zelnick noted, Rockstar has traditionally started with console releases in the past: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, for instance, released in September 2013 while the PC version (initially aiming for simultaneous release) was delayed until April 2015.</p>
<p>Rockstar also has a torrid history with modders, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-spilled-hot-coffee">infamous Hot Coffee mod</a>.</p>
<p>Just last month, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shut down an ambitious mod that put a playable version of GTA 4's Liberty City inside GTA 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could already be in the hands of some users, according to some new online reports.</p>
<p>As reported on Bluesky by Necro Felipe, the same user on the Xiaohongshu forums who shared the console's CAD model <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">a few months back</a> claims to have obtained a real Nintendo Switch 2 unit, most likely via illegal means. If this is true, we should expect more information on the system to surface online before the April 2nd Direct and the hands-on events that will be held worldwide in the coming months.</p>

<p>Among the many things we still don't know about the Nintendo Switch 2 is how much the system will cost, as the Japanese company has not said much on the matter yet other than the fact that they are considering multiple factors for the system's price, including inflation, exchange rate and the price range that consumers expect for Nintendo products. As reported by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/rumour-placeholder-retail-listing-suggests-switch-2-price-might-be-cheaper-than-expected">Nintendo Life</a>, according to two images showing Costco Canada's backend product listing and a printed sign with an obvious misspelling recently shared on the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, the console could cost 499 Canadian dollars, around 350 US dollars, which would be an excellent price for the system, although a direct conversion may not be very accurate, looking at the current Switch pricing in different regions.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch later this year worldwide. As already mentioned, the next look at the system will come during a dedicated Nintendo Direct scheduled for<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/"> April 2nd.</a></p>
