                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has been a hit out of the gate, but even Bethesda and developer Virtuos acknowledge that it isn't perfect. There are bugs and glitches in Oblivion Remastered just as there are in almost every video game upon release, particularly Bethesda games. Now, Betheda is sharing the first update for the game to address some of these issues.</p><p>Through the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a>, Bethesda laid out the contents of Oblivion Remastered's Update 1.1. This is the first of two separate updates that Bethesda plans to launch in the near future, although the second one doesn't have a date attached to it yet. Update 1.1 and its follow-up will be released on the Steam Beta first before being shared with Oblivion Remastered's console counterparts.</p><p>Update 1.1 is out today, June 5, on Oblivion Remastered's Steam Beta, and the wider rollout of the update will begin on June 11. The initial update is intended to tackle the major bugs that have come up, although some of the glitches addressed--including the disappearance of Vincente Valtieri's hair and High Chancellor Ocato's immobile arms--are unintentionally funny. The second planned update will concentrate on improving the game's performance. Bethesda didn't provide any details beyond that.</p><p>While the wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-elder-scrolls-6-just-reached-a-sad-milestone/1100-6528679/" data-ref-id="1100-6528679">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> has been excruciating for some players, Oblivion Remastered has reminded others why they loved the franchise in the first place.

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive has officially announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, the studio's new third-person James Bond game.

Immediately after the trailer aired, people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/search?q=patrick%20gibson%20james%20bond&amp;src=typed_query" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">elsewhere</a> said they think Irish actor Patrick Gibson is playing the role. He's known for his roles in The Tudors, Shadow and Bone, and Tolkien. Most recently, he played a young Dexter Morgan on the Dexter prequel series Original Sin. Indeed, Gibson certainly looks the part. But anything is possible.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new James Bond is 100% played by Patrick Gibson.<br>He’s an Irish actor who I know as playing Dexter in Dexter: Original Sin.<br>He’s a PHENOMENAL actor and I’m sure he’ll be GREAT as Bond! <a href="https://t.co/q58Cn0eQE7" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/q58Cn0eQE7</a></p>  — GameRoll (@GameRoll_) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As of yet, however, IO Interactive has yet to announce who is playing Bond in First Light.

This is a brand-new character, but some of the Bond series veterans like M, Q, and Moneypenny will appear in First Light as well.</p><p>Like Bond himself, actors playing those roles have yet to be confirmed, nor do we know who's playing the mysterious character Isola or any of the "whole new cast of villains."</p><p>First Light tells the story of how James Bond became 007, picking up with Bond when he was a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy. Like the movies, First Light will tell a globe-trotting story focused on action and espionage.</p><p>First Light launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-working-its-magic-on-zelda-and-splatoon-it-turns-out-monolith-soft-also-aided-development-of-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Monolith Soft has officially announced the company helped with the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The developer, which previously assisted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-2">Splatoon 2</a> <a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1930459571275084157">has stated on social media</a> it developed the "fields and character designs" for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> racing game.</p>
<p>The studio has a history of open world video game development, becoming something of an expert in that particular area given the time spent on recent Zelda titles as well as its own Xenoblade releases. As such it makes sense why Nintendo would bring Monolith Soft over for Mario Kart World given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">the games' shift to a non-linear format</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-fully-owns-xenoblade-studio-monolith-soft">Nintendo became the sole owner of Monolith Soft</a> after years of holding roughly 80 percent of the company since 2007. In 2011, Nintendo would increase its stake to 97 percent of the company, after which those working there contributed to popular Nintendo series like Animal Crossing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, and Zelda.</p>
<p>In recent years, Monolith Soft has largely been known for its ongoing Xenoblade series. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> was released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">to high critical praise</a>, and would continue this trend in 2025 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> was something of a technical marvel in the Wii U, and its Switch version brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-tech-review">that same quality packaged with various visual updates</a>, dynamic resolution scaling, and greater environment detail among other tweaks and improvements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, we got our first good look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light. While the developer has said that First Light - or as it was previously known, Project 007 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">will serve as an origin story for the spy</a>, and not be a "gamification" of any of the films that have come before, last night's trailer still had a fair few nods to Bonds of the past.</p>
<p>Please note, I will be talking about events from the James Bond series generally below, <strong>so please be aware of potential spoilers for the films and books if you haven't already enjoyed them for yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>First up, there is this Bond's facial scar. As you can see in the trailer above, this young Bond may be fresh faced when it comes to life as an agent, but he has clearly had a few scrapes already, earning himself a long thin scar down his cheek.</p>
<p>While the Bonds in the films have not boasted a scar like this, the book version of Bond did. Ian Flemming wrote that Bond had a three-inch long, thin vertical scar running down his right cheek. You can see some artwork of this book-based Bond below.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, given his overall look in the game, many have surmised that the actor playing James Bond in First Light is Patrick Gibson from Dexter: Original Sin (I have asked IO if they can confirm this).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to this physical trait, there are also multiple other nods to the James Bond book and film series scattered throughout First Light's trailer that hint to the story, such as Bond's parents dying in a climbing-related accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trailer says 009 is a "master manipulator", which made me think this was a little tease for him being a bit of a bad egg that fooled and betrayed his country a la Sean Bean's 006 from GoldenEye. A little number flip there from IO?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On the cars and gadget side of things, because of course Bond is going to have cars and gadgets, First Light again is honouring the series that has come before.</p>
<p>In IO's trailer, Bond can be seen entering Q branch, where he selects one from a number of watches. This watch obviously does more than tell the time, and triggers a blast from a nearby motorbike, which again is in keeping with Bond's watches from the series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While in the Sean Connory era, Bond often sported a Rolex Submariner, in many of the later films he changed things up a bit, with the agent wearing watches such as a Pulsar LED digital and a Seiko 0674 LC at times. </p>
<p>In 2006's Casino Royale, which marked Daniel Craig's first outing as the MI6 agent, Vesper Lynd commented on Bond's watch: "Rolex?" she asks. "Omega," he replies. Bond's watches are a big deal, and in First Light, <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1930380893811610084">IO has partnered with Omega</a> once again.</p>

<p>Speaking of partnering with a known Bond-brand again, of course we will see the agent in an Aston Martin in First Light.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This vehicle is slicker than Moore's bus from Live and Let Die, but it is the same as the actors' yellow Aston Martin DBS from The Persauders, so another little nod to the series' legacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can see IO's Bond chasing down a red sports car in the First Light trailer, which reminded me a bit of the playful chase between Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Setting the scene further, then, we also saw a chess game being played during last night's trailer. Now, we don't clearly see <em>who </em>is playing chess here, so it could be Bond flexing his prowess like he often does at cards. And is that a martini, shaken not stirred?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That said, in From Russia with Love, there is a scene where Bond baddy Kronsteen plays chess, so as soon as I saw this moment in the First Light trailer, I thought of that. Essentially, baddies play chess, right?</p>

<p>There is a clip towards the end of the trailer where a speed boat zips through some islands very much like those from The Man With the Golden Gun (Khao Phing Kan, but known also as James Bond Island, no less). This is one of my favourite James Bond locations, so I was pleased to see this pop up. </p>

<p>Last up for this piece (I am sure I will be doing more, because guys, it's Bond!), the music played over the trailer was the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. You can have a listen to it below. </p>

<p>007: First Light is set for release in 2026. Towards the end of last year, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oblivion's a notoriously buggy game, so it probably shouldn't have been too much of a surprise that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> was also pretty damn buggy. While a lot of those bugs are the kind of charming nonsense TES 4 is beloved for, Bethesda and Virtuos have now confirmed that the remaster's got two updates incoming to fix its more serious problems.</p>
<p>Having scrolled through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for the first of these updates, which releases in Steam beta today, there's one fix that's stood out, because the thing it outlines has been haunting my dreams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first of these, Update 1.1, releases via Steam beta on June 5 and focuses on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes". It'll be available across all platforms as of June 11.</p>
<p>The second update, meanwhile, will aim to improve the game's performance. It doesn't have a date yet, just a "we will share more details when we are able".</p>
<p>One of Update 1.1's quest fixes is designed to stop "Vicente Valtieri losing his hair" during the Dark Brotherhood mission A Knife In The Dark. I ran into this glitch while reviewing the game, and while it wasn't that much of an inconvenience, returning from a mission to find the usually dapper vampire assassin had gone full Ross Kemp was definitely an experience. Especially when his hair then miraculously grew back by the next time I visited for a chat.</p>
<p>Among the patch's other interesting fixes are ones for High Chancellor Ocato's "arms not animating", Thieves Guild NPCs just not showing up at all, and Savlian Matius getting stuck after the castle courtyard fight when you're re-taking Kvatch. I think I narrowly avoided that last one, as I recall Matius seemingly very reticent to follow my hero into the castle, despite all his chatter about time being of the essence in saving the count.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-comes-with-a-below-average-display-and-disappointing-hdr-support-new-in-depth-analysis-reveals.1208082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a below-average display that fails to deliver an acceptable HDR experience, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>The new analysis by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamingTech-YouTube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamingTech</a>, which can be watched in full below, takes a good look at the new Nintendo system's display, confirming it comes with a maximum peak brightness of around 400, 450 nits. Measuring the brightness in Zelda: Breath of the Wild returned a maximum value of 420 nits, but in Cyberpunk 2077, it is locked to 450 nits, likely the maximum peak brightness the display is capable of. This peak brightness is not even close to providing a proper HDR experience, which is made worse because we are talking about an LCD display that fails to display black correctly due to the back lighting and the constant black level rise of 0.5 nits.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's HDR support in docked mode fares a little better. The system-level calibration is found to be adequate, and in games like Cyberpunk 2077, the system delivers an HDR experience on par with that of the other versions of the game. In other games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the HDR experience is rather disappointing, as the game looks washed out due to its aesthetics and the lack of contrast.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches today worldwide. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">day one update</a> has also been rolled out in all regions, enabling network features, access to the new eShop, and more.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> you ride a magical blade across shifting dunes of golden sand. It looks like a combination of the jetbike desert-crossing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> and the meditative hiking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a>. Which makes sense when you learn the art director from the latter game is leading the team. I like the look of it. Surfing is cool and so are swords, so I'm happy to see it's coming out in just a couple months, as announced at last night's State of Play show by PlayStation.</p>

<p>It's due out on August 19th this year, say developers Giant Squid. You might know them as the creators of peaceful ocean diving game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abzu">Abzu</a>, or the speedy running and slick archery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>. To my shame I have played neither of these. But then, neither of them has you kickflipping across a mysterious fantasy landscape on a giant medieval weapon. I think maybe this is the one for me, yes.</p>
<p>When the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-new-desert-surfing-adventure-from-the-devs-behind-abzu-and-journey">first announced in 2023</a>, the sword you ride was described as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one". As for the story, it seems as mystical as the game looks.</p>
<p>"You are the Wraith," explained creative director Matt Nava in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-sword-of-the-sea-a-new-game-from-giant-squid/">a blog</a>, "resurrected in a desolate world and tasked with restoring life to it as you explore submerged ruins and the vibrant, varied cultures within. Surf through sinking tombs, mysterious shipwrecks, and petrified battlefields – and bring giant shoals of fish and creatures back in the process. But beware- this land is also home to massive leviathans that will stand in your way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 system software update, released yesterday, introduced a rather major fix alongside the minor enhancements documented in the official update note.</p>
<p>As initially reported on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1l3ane7/it_seems_like_todays_ps5_software_update_fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, and later confirmed by Sony itself to Digital Foundry, the latest system software update fixed a known VRR issue that caused stuttering in games running at 120 Hz with unlocked framerate like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Diablo 4. The stuttering issues would present themselves even in games that do not have 120 Hz modes but take advantage of the system-level feature that works in the 48Hz to 60Hz range, and even in this case, the issues have been reportedly fixed, as Elden Ring no longer starts stuttering after 20 minutes of play like it did before. It's definitely surprising not to see this rather major PlayStation 5 issue getting fixed highlighted in the patch notes, but still, it's very good that Sony finally addressed this issue to offer on its current-generation systems the same smooth VRR experience that has been provided by the Xbox Series systems.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqttdmj5k22n" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihudk77y4uudgeihjol3bdazmvfkgabdw5bkjpfcb7ex6y3pkx3cq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system">
<p lang="en">Sony PR contacted me yesterday to confirm that - as already detected by some - the latest PlayStation firmware resolves the VRR hiccup issue. When I find a spare moment, I'll test it out.</p>
<p>— Digital Foundry (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk?ref_src=embed">@digitalfoundry.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk/post/3lqttdmj5k22n?ref_src=embed">June 5, 2025 at 9:47 AM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-04-11-40-00/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> did not introduce any major new features to the console, introducing only improvements for messages and usability on some screens. The latest update, which introduced some new features, was released back in April. It reintroduced the PlayStation 30th Anniversary UI and the Audio Focus feature, which allows players to better hear quiet sounds and voice chat in games.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, things are all fine for Hinako and her mates until a fog decsends on the town of Ebisugaoka, cue a 10/10 creepy laugh and the start of things going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">spookily pear-shaped</a>. Konami producer Motoi Okamoto provided a bit more info in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> released alongside the release date reveal trailer.</p>
<p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town," he wrote, "she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?"</p>
<p>Okamoto cites the game as having "four pillars". These main goals were letting folks explore an "authentic depiction of 1960s Japan", crafting monster design and the soundtrack to focus on the "juxtaposition between beauty and terror", developing puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering", and putting together a "unique" combat system.</p>
<p>"The encounters are as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life," the producer wrote of that last part. "The combat will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>."</p>
<p>The spin-off, penned by Ryukishi07, is designed to work as both an entry point to the series for newbies, and reward veterans with plenty of easter eggs. Last night's showcase also featured the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-is-coming-in-2026-but-once-again-it-looks-like-us-pc-gamers-will-have-to-wait">Nioh 3</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has discussed the future of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and the developer's continued desire to grow the game from something known primarily as a battle royale into a platform that offers experiences of numerous different genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several years after Fortnite's much-promoted Big Bang event that launched Lego Fortnite, Rock Band developer Harmonix's Festival and Rocket League maker Psyonix's Rocket Racing, Sweeney told IGN at Unreal Fest 2025 that Epic Games' key issue remained the fact that people still think of Fortnite simply as its leading battle royale portion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Progress towards that goal has, so far, been steady. Festival continues to attract big name music acts to headline its seasons with new player skins and music drops. Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a survival crafting experience, has a solid player core. But Rocket Racing has largely been retired, and newer shooter-centric modes such as Reload have found more success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During its State of Unreal show this week, Epic Games noted that a third-party experience in Fortnite had momentarily overtaken Epic's own core modes for the first time, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But Epic Games' own non-shooter modes currently show no signs of replicating this success, with player numbers well below that of the developer's main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists, let alone Reload or the game's Fortnite OG throwback offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked by IGN whether engagement for modes such as the musical Fortnite Festival and various Lego Fortnite experiences were where Epic Games wanted them to be, Epic Games executive vice president Sax Persson replied: "I don't think we're ever happy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the shooter modes have done well," Sweeney added. "I think we've not yet achieved the magic that we've been hoping to achieve with the music gameplay. It's funny, we brought in the Harmonix team, [they] joined Epic, built Rock Band and Guitar Hero in the past, they're an awesome team, and they've been riffing on approaches to that genre and Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They've also been bringing in all kinds of music items into Fortnite with Jam Tracks, which have not only a song, but all the beats associated with them, and ability to play them on your instruments."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite Fortnite's hugely-popular musical live events generating massive interest and player numbers in the millions, Epic has not yet found a formula that generates regular engagement of the same kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," Sweeney noted, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think as Rock Band and Guitar Hero themselves achieved in their day, which was a decade or two decades ago, there's an opportunity for a music game with tens of millions of monthly active users that people just absolutely love and come to every evening or weekend for the coolest concert and competitive gameplay of all sorts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How about Lego, then, the brand that's perhaps now the most deeply entrenched within the Fortnite ecosystem, and the offering that's most popular of all Epic's non-shooter modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Lego is interesting, Persson said. "We are super proud of [the] journey and it has a really dedicated fan base. But is it as big as we would want it to be? No, we would love to have it bigger and figure out a way to get more Lego fans to see that this exists."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Revealed for Nintendo Switch 2 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it sounds like Epic is still facing the issue that Fortnite currently remains a brand associated with being a battle royale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What's our primary challenge? Our primary challenge is Fortnite is Fortnite, and historically Fortnite was a shooter game," Persson continued. "It is not a shooter game anymore. It is the everything game, and we need to tell that story better than what we've done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One solution to this will be the forthcoming rollout of improved capabilities for third-party teams working within Fortnite's Unreal Engine-powered editor, UEFN, Sweeney said. Epic currently has a better toolset than other creators, but this will change over time — to the point that Epic's own battle royale seasons will eventually (now in 2026) be made with the same tools as any creator could have access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we develop our modes, we're working with C++ and the entire Unreal Engine, [while] creators working with the toolset that we built, it's Verse and some APIs," Sweeney noted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our big task now is to get the two of those development frameworks to converge so that we, Epic, and creators are working in the exact same tools with the exact same capabilities and creators will have way more power at their disposal there, and that's been the thing that we've been working so hard on for the last two years."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But why not just settle with being a brilliantly successful battle royale? For Epic Games, the future of Fortnite as a continued experience — and source of enormous income for the company — rests on its continued evolution and ongoing cultural relevance, amid the ever-changing landscape of popular video game tastes and genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem," Sweeney concluded. "If somebody else actually beats us at our game, and builds something that's bigger and cooler and better than battle royale... I think there's a high probability of that happening. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," he added, noting the evolution of shooters from simple games of Deathmatch to modes with larger player counts and vehicles. "Battle Royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented — and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of secret agent James Bond haven't taken long to decide who they think is the (not so) mysterious actor playing the role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's new trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">revealed at Sony's State of Play broadcast</a>, shows off a notably younger-looking Bond, fresh out of the Royal Navy and keen to earn his 00 agent status. But who is playing the title role?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minutes after the trailer aired, fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> began guessing that Dexter: New Blood star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond — and he certainly shares a strong similarity with the character in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I clocked it THE SECOND I saw the dirty smirk of his," wrote one 007 aficionado. "Yeah I peeped that as soon as I seen it," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching the trailer and knew the face looked familiar," said a third. "After about a minute or so I screamed 'DEXTER.' I'm pretty sure it's him."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aged 30, the Irish actor is just a few years older than the 26-year-old version of Bond he looks set to portray in the upcoming game — and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">if IO Interactive gets its way, several sequels</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if Gibson looks familiar to you too, well, the actor already has a swathe of TV and film roles under his belt, including appearances in Shadow and Bone, The Tudors, and The OA. But it's his role as a younger version of Dexter Morgan in prequel series Dexter: Original Sin for which he's most famous.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-632417032-1749114309513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Gibson. Photo by Francois G. Durand/WireImage.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, 007 First Light developer IO Interactive is yet to confirm Gibson itself — though IGN has asked the studio if it can comment on the internet's speculation. Gibson also, for now, appears to keeping schtum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside Gibson's apparent debut in 007 First Light's trailer describes the game as as globe-trotting story-driven action-adventure game where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed Bond cracking a couple of deadpan jokes as he got himself out of (and into) trouble. Gibson's acting chops as the antihero Dexter look set to be put to good use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light is due to launch at some point in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly," Suda51 explained.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened). The final stage of game development is really similar to the world of the movie Beautiful Dreamer, like the night just before a big school festival. Man, it’s been awhile – now I want to watch Beautiful Dreamer again. What, you don’t know that movie...? I guess maybe a lot of you are a bit too young to remember it... It’s probably streaming somewhere, so check it out sometime."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Romeo Is a Dead Man is an "ultra-violent science fiction" action game coming from the collective minds of Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture. Romeo Stargazer — which is one of the best protagonist names I've ever seen, by the way — is an FBI Space-Time special agent searching the universe for the most-wanted fugitives. It's slated for PC via Steam and Microsoft, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, but isn't expected to release until 2026. As for why Grasshopper has given such a vague release window? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it?" Suda51 said, hinting at what can only be in reference to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a>. "That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony kicked off the summer reveal season with a bang, presenting a smorgasbord of new games to whet our appetites going into Summer Games Fest Week. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced"><u>Here's everything announced at PlayStation State of Play 2025</u></a> last night, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls"><u>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles"><u>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f'</u></a>s release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Both are on Steam Beta first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This first update focuses on quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes. The second update will focus on performance. Bethesda said it will share more details “when we are able.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A performance patch is much needed. Oblivion Remastered has enjoyed a hugely successful launch, with over 4 million players and a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam. However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> found Oblivion Remastered on consoles to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time — quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged play through, Morgan revealed. And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” Morgan continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF called PC performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DF’s analysis in full</u></a> for more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Update 1.1., highlights include ToggleHudVisibility and ShowHud console commands, which will be perfect for those looking to capture Oblivion Remastered screenshots (it’s a gorgeous game!), a fix for not automatically showing the Local Map when inside interior spaces, a fix for the Local Map being blank when opening, and a fix for the first-person camera being set above the player's head. And here's a good one: there's a fix for Vincente Valtieri losing his hair. It was fun while it lasted!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

            <p>Everyone, stretch your hamstrings. Leg-having simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> got a release date during last night's PlayStation State of Play. As shown in the trailer below, the game is not so much a "walking sim" as a "walking badly sim". But hey, that's what you get from the makers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ape-out">Ape Out</a>. It was also revealed that the "hero" of the game is in dire need of the bathroom.</p>

<p>It's due out September 8th, say the developers. Baby Steps was delayed last year, alongside enough other games to warrant a satirical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-have-delayed-baby-steps-skate-story-stick-it-to-the-stickman-into-2025">"Best Delayed Games" awards show</a> from publishers Devolver. That's okay, it's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most anticipated games</a> of this year.</p>
<p>You play as Nate, an "unemployed failson" who is one day magically thrust into the wilderness and must learn to use his actual legs to actually walk on the actual ground. What! I could muse about this being a tale of overcoming learned helplessness, or a story about facing down crippling social anxiety, or a comic commentary on humanity's habit of cognitive offloading - giving all mental effort to machinery. But then, I'd be doing the work for you. Just play the game and analyse it yourself, for heaven's sake.</p>
<p>Getting Over It was a silly meditation on difficulty and perseverance disguised as a game that streamers would love because it allowed them to scream a lot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE6Tr5QUeyI">Matt had a go</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwgeFwH9To">I had a go</a>, and then I gave up because I had other things to do and I hate being bad at things. I did not get over it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/ratatan-the-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-launches-its-first-public-demo-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, I know there’s something going on today with Nintendo, and Switches, and Mario Kart, and a bunch of other things BUT let me direct you to the other most exciting news of the day which is that Ratatan, the spiritual successor to the beloved Patapon series, is launching <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">its first public demo</a> today, June 5th, at noon BST. Given that the series relies on timing, perhaps they should have picked another day? Still, if you’re not about to fill your house with the noises of blue shells going up plumbers’ bottoms, perhaps you’d like to fill it with the crazy sounds of creatures blowing trumpets to direct their pals to attack giant monsters. Doesn’t that sound good?</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Official Gameplay Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okG0R8r_G8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’ll only sound good if you get the timing right, as Ratatan, like Patapon before it, is a rhythm action game, that has you pressing buttons in time to the music and beat to direct your diminutive army to attack, retreat, defend and run. It sounds simple, and in theory, it is, but as compelling gaming goes, few things have you reaching the same level of zen as Patapon does., If Ratatan can achieve that same trick, we’re in for a treat.</p>
<p>Ratatan pulls in some of that lovely modern roguelike progression, so you can assume that you’ll be levelling up, growing your team’s abilities and adding new troops and weaponry to your army while failing or dying a few times along the way. In fairness, that sounds a lot like the progression from the original Patapon games, but I don’t think I ever thought of them as roguelikes…</p>
<p>The side-scrolling 2D action can be enjoyed by up to four players in co-op, which sounds chaotic. I have little idea how that’s going to work, but the listing for the game says that there can be up to 100 characters on screen, so maybe, you’re just all there?</p>

<p>There’s not long to wait, as you can get ready to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3449820/Ratatan_Demo/">demo on Steam</a> now, with a later link coming for Nintendo Switch (and presumably Nintendo Switch 2 as well).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-is-now-explorable-via-your-own-personal-rideable-rowboat-thanks-to-this-mod.1208013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-your-own-personal-rideable-rowboat-mod-sailing-around-cyrodiil-as-magical-mariner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Horses are overrated. Yeah, I said it. No offence to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/could-the-witcher-4s-kelpie-be-the-best-video-game-horse-yet-we-asked-an-expert">any horse experts</a> out there. They’re a bit of an unnecessary purchase in Elder Scrolls games in my experience. </p>
<p>But how else am I supposed to travel? Ah, of course, by boat. I looked at Nexus Mods this morning and spotted that a modder has saved my poor feet by managing to get fully-functional rowboats working in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>, so I can sail around Cyrodiil as a magical mariner.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4273?tab=description">Row Your Boat</a> does what it says on the tin, provided you count it as 'rowing' if you're doing it via a spell rather than actual manual labour. Drawing inspiration from some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/3575">classic</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/6690">Oblivion</a> mods, Tyler ‘Dactyl’ Hallada’s created a means to buy a usable rowboat that you can summon and use to sail the waterways of the Imperial province, merrily waving to all the poor landlubbers you pass and praying that you don’t spring a leak.</p>
<p>As you can see demoed in the showcase video below, the boat’s controlled by casting a special row spell while standing up or crouched to move forwards and backwards, with the direction you’re looking acting as the steering. One you’re up to speed, you can also basically set it in cruise control so it’ll keep carving along while your character’s free to take in the scenery and rest their arms.</p>

<p>Hallada’s implemented stuff like “dynamic collision detection” and “realistic wave simulation” to make things feel more authentically boaty, and added a handy in-game manual in case you get stuck. You can also purchase upgrades for the boat, in the form of a storage chest, working lamp, and a rope ladder to make boarding easier.</p>
<p>It’s worth bearing in mind that the mod’s pretty hardware-intensive right now, with its creator writing: “You may experience some performance impact, especially with a weak CPU. This mod is pushing the limits of the script engine. I’ve spent a lot of time to reduce the performance impact and minimise script execution when the boat is not in use. I personally don’t notice an FPS impact but your mileage may vary.” There's also a list of known issues on the mod page that's worth scanning through.</p>
<p>If you fancy taking to the seas, you’ll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1272">TesSyncMapInjector</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966">MagicLoader 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/282">Oblivion Remastered Script Extender</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/473">NL-Tag Remover</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today's the day.

And Will the Switch 2 launch go as smoothly and successfully as Nintendo hopes?</p>
<p>We'll be covering all aspects of the Switch 2 launch and gathering everything together here so you can see at a glance what's been going on. We'll be keeping an eye on any launch issues there may be, any launch stock there may be, and how the world is reacting to playing Nintendo's new machine.

    Like my colleagues, I am also sat waiting impatiently for a package to arrive. It's quite rude of the post to be this late, frankly. Don't they know I need to be playing F-Zero GX on a Switch 2 right now, even though I have a copy on a shelf next to me I could already be playing?

    <p>Not everyone can or wants to jump into a new console on day one, but thankfully the Switch is still home to loads of games and it's doubtful you've played all of them. Our own Christian Donlan reckons you should <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-week-the-switch-2-launches-is-it-too-late-to-buy-one-last-switch-game-not-if-its-burnout">get Burnout Paradise</a> if you're yet to give it a whirl.</p>

    <p>Anyone good with screen protector woes? I applied a tempered glass protector, and it seemed to go perfectly, but then this spot never filled in properly. Is this a "get a new protector" situation? Anyone managed to fix this before? You are my only hope Eurogamer readers.</p>

			<p>I never played the original Fantasy Life on the Nintendo 3DS, so I jumped into Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time completely unaware of what I would be signing up for. As my customised character was tossed through a time portal to an ancient island, I gradually found my feet, settling into a quaint life-sim fuelled by a choice from over a dozen job-altering Life selections. This was plenty interesting, but by the time I got used to that loop, I was whisked through another portal and dropped onto an entire other island where the entire ebb and flow of the game completely changed.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time – Final Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ABhNnsO4Fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From a life sim, the game first morphed into a sort of top-down Breath of the Wild style adventure through a massive map full of dungeons and monsters. And then two more times, the game pulls a rug out from under you that you didn’t even realise was there, layering in Animal Crossing style town and home customisation, before also adding a massive helping of roguelite dungeon crawling for good measure.</p>



<p>Many games struggle to make just one of these concepts work as a full experience – but Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time manages to pack all of these together into an endlessly addictive sprawl of life simulation and RPG adventure that is bursting at the seams with exciting stuff to do.</p>

<p>As the dust settles, and you finally get to the core of what Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is, you’re given access to multiple maps that each house various NPCs, bosses, resources, gathering spots, fishing hubs, and more. You’re thrust into a sprawling story of time travel and fantastical adventuring that guides you across these various lands, but I quickly found all my own personal motivations for exploration and adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest of these were my Lives – unique character classes across a spectrum of fighting, crafting, and gathering that let you perform different actions depending on which Life you equip. I started out as a Blacksmith, but soon needed ore to craft a new sword. Swapping to the Miner Life let me gather that ore myself, and once the sword was made, I could become a Paladin and use it to fight off monsters, gathering their parts to use as an Alchemist to brew potions, and on and on down an endless web of activities. Each Life has unique quests, a sprawling skill tree, and special gear to gather.</p>

<p>At times, the grind to advance these Lives or create a particularly rare item can be a little exhausting on your own. As you fight bosses and explore dungeons, though, you’ll rescue characters who can become members of your party and help you fight, gather, fish, and more. I loved this system, but I do wish the companion characters were a bit more interactive. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time skews so far tonally toward Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing that you’d expect to be able to bond with or even romance these characters, but they’re mostly there to act as extra bodies in your quest for experience and items.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time sometimes apes the homework of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild a little too directly, but when you wander into the ever-changing roguelike dungeon, it’s unlike anything else out there. Each room of the dungeon, rather than simply tasking you to fight a daunting boss or horde of enemies, will require you to accomplish various Life-related tasks before your time-limit of exploration hits. One room might trap you in a fishing tug-of-war with a massive underwater beast, while another has you racing to gather every vegetable. There are proper battles mixed in as well, but the way these zones re-contextualise your tranquil Life activities into tense and speedy challenges is such a delight.</p>

<p>I only wish it was more rewarding to experience these delights with friends. Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time supports multiplayer, but your activities are limited not just in scope, but in time as well. You aren’t able to fully progress quests together or do anything in your custom settlement besides look around. If you decide to go into the open world together to gather materials and fight bosses, you’re forced to end the session after just 30 minutes. This is a game where co-op progress is constantly gated or held up, making it impossible to lose hours with a loved one the way you can lose that time by yourself.</p>

<p>It's coming out February 24th next year. The ocean-exploring game is set on a flooded earth on which "deadly plastification threatens to kill all living things". It mostly looks like an adventure of gathering resources, meeting strange new folk, and possibly killing them. </p>
<p>The catch is that you're always following in the wake of another player, whose own choices colour how people will react to you. In the trailer above we see Souls-esque phantoms of other adventurers affecting the player's world. They might have taken some loot you wanted, or maybe they threw a dude into the toxic water and now you've got to deal with the poor sick fella afterwards. It's basically a "choices matter" game, but someone else is doing the choosing. That said, other players may also be following you.</p>
<p>"Each person who plays is recorded, their choices are saved, and you can follow them along your journey! A friend? A streamer? The choice is yours!" say developers Digixart. "You will feel the impact from the consequences of the one you follow and must deal with them! It’s up to you to cooperate... or to make some waves!"</p>
<p>Okay, calm down please, marketing copy. No need for all those exclams. Anyway, there were a lot of choices to make in Road 96 too, the previous singleplayer game by Digixart. It was well-liked by Alice B (RPS in peace). "This political road trip is rendered an exciting and entertaining time by its cast and the deliberately piecemeal nature of its storytelling, rather than the story itself," she said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/road-96-review">her review</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One of the most interesting surprise announcements from <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's State of Play</a> is Sea of Remnants. Developed by Joker Studio, primarily known for the asymmetrical multiplayer survival horror game Identity V, and published by NetEase Games, the game is described as a free-to-play ocean adventure roleplaying game scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Sylar Pan, Product Lead at Joker Studio, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Sea of Remnants places the world’s fate directly in the players’ hands. With more than 300 characters to interact with—whether as allies, enemies, or something in between—every action can trigger surprising and far-reaching consequences. We’re excited to see the stories players will create when they finally set sail.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Remnants | Anchors Aweigh, Capt'n -  Gameplay Trailer | Get ready for PlayStation!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02YOz0N51ME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The premise of Sea of Remnants is quite peculiar. Players will take the role of puppet-looking sailors who have lost all their memories and embark on a journey alongside a mysterious girl across vast seas and uncharted islands to a city slowly awakening to its secrets.</p>
<p>During their travels, players can recruit a crew of unique puppetfolk allies, customize their ships with modular upgrades, and assemble specialized teams for exploration and turn-based battles. Every decision, whether sparing enemies or seizing opportunities, will have dramatic consequences for the world. As rival factions react to each choice and the cityscape of Orbtopia evolves in response, no two captains will experience the same journey.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while land combat is turn-based, naval fights take place in real time, with positioning and timing playing a crucial role in the outcome. As mentioned by the developer in the above statement, there will be over 300 non-player characters to interact with, each featuring distinct designs and personalities as well as their own allegiances. Players can befriend, provoke, or remove them. When in Orbtopia, players will even find leisure activities such as mahjong, and life skills such as hotspot cooking and fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> of Sea of Remnants already includes the minimum and recommended requirements.</p>
