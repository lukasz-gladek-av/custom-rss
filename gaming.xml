			<p>Multiple Nintendo Switch game prototypes have leaked online, including prototypes of an unreleased Ridge Racer game and a canceled RPG that was in the works by Metroid Prime series' developer Retro Studios.</p>
<p>According to multiple online<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jtcjcr/several_switch_dev_builds_has_leaked_from_devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> reports</a>, the prototypes leaked online after they were found in a devkit, and include old Splatoon 2 debug builds, the Nintendo Switch version of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rime-when-in-doubt-follow-fox/">RiME</a>, an unreleased Lego Civilization game, an ARMS debug build and prototypes of a new entry in the Ridge Racer series and of Retro Studios' canceled Project Harmony music RPG which was reportedly in development after the studio released Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and Metroid Prime Remastered. Footage of the latter two games was also shared online and can be found <a href="https://streamable.com/2mkoof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for Project Harmony and below for the Ridge Racer prototype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An early build of the cancelled Ridge Racer game developed by Bandai Namco Studios Singapore has been leaked online, built on Unreal Engine 4! This dates back to January 6th, 2017.<br>
Here's footage of the game build in action!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RidgeRacer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RidgeRacer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BandaiNamco?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BandaiNamco</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UE4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UE4</a> <a href="https://t.co/YhqS3a1vWu">pic.twitter.com/YhqS3a1vWu</a></p>
<p>— Jesse Young (@resethepicture) <a href="https://twitter.com/resethepicture/status/1909086888616747239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given Bandai Namco's strong relationship with Nintendo, it is not surprising to see that the collaboration between the two companies was leading to the return of the Ridge Racer series on Nintendo Switch. While the game has been canceled, the collaboration between the two companies still continues to this day, as Bandai Namco is working with Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai on Kirby Air Riders, which is launching this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. A collaboration that is hardly surprising, considering Sakurai-san teamed up with Bandai Namco for the development of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U &amp; 3DS and Ultimate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Minecraft Movie has shattered expectations at the box office, proving the strength of the IP created by Mojang and owned by Microsoft. Whereas estimates assumed it could earn around $150 million globally, the videogame adaptation actually opened up to $157 million earned in the United States and $144 in the rest of the world, for a grand total of $301 million throughout the whole weekend.</p>
<p>This set a new record, improving upon Nintendo's and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $146.4 million across the United States in its first three days in theaters. Of course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie continued its run to earn <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $500 million in its first week</a> and $1.36 billion at the end of its box office run. We'll have to wait and see if A Minecraft Movie has the same legs, but so far, the indications are very positive.</p>
<p>The movie was produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and the company's chiefs, Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, wasted no time expressing their elation at the news:</p>
<p><em>We’re absolutely overjoyed A Minecraft Movie has been so warmly received by audiences around the world. A Minecraft Movie’s decade-long journey to the screen was overseen with great care by WBP’s Jesse Ehrman and his team, and we are thrilled their efforts have resulted in such a tremendous response.</em></p>
<p>The film was directed by Jared Hess and features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel House, and Jemaine Clement. Jack Black plays Steve, who is the default player character skin in the game.</p>
<p>The success of A Minecraft Movie will likely spur even more videogame adaptations across film and TV. That said, it's worth remembering that Minecraft is the best-selling game ever, with over 350 million copies sold to date. As such, this adaptation's successful release is not necessarily indicative of other intellectual properties.</p>

            <p>As behemoth live service shooters struggle to retain audiences with seasonal events and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2-is-getting-a-classic-mode-that-restores-the-shooter-to-how-it-was-in-2016">"classic" modes</a> that sometimes just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-is-revisiting-the-past-but-it-should-be-prouder-of-its-present">channel nostalgia</a>, one small PvP shooter is simply plugging away adding map after map after map after map. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a>, the 1v1 online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> that sees you duke it out with a friendfoe in cramped concrete arenas, has just added another 35 deathpits to its rotating menu of shooty locales. It now has 226 maps on which to kill and be killed. That is beautiful. That is sublime. That is Straftat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's now a map called "Autobahn" where you have to pummel each other with baseball bats while cars rush past and turn you to mush. There's a new "Aquatic" arena which is like having a fight at the bottom of a fish tank. And one called "Garden_04" which is set in a tranquil garden of trees and trellises, with wind chimes twinkling as you batter your opponent with a huge mace. </p>

<p>This April maps update also adds 15 new hats to the shooter, as well as a few bug fixes, according to the developers' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2386720/eventcomments/599648970674855852?snr=1_2108_9__2107">post on Steam</a>. Normally, having over 200 maps in a shooter might seem gratuitous. But Straftat is all about quickfire rounds of random mayhem. It's a showdown on shuffle. Sometimes you'll race through a warren of complex tunnels, looking for a decent pistol. Other times you will occupy the same constricted 2 metres squared as your opponent, a concrete island suspended in a deadly void. Death is certain. Victory, a treat.</p>
<p>It's a rich delicacy for fans of old-school multiplayer arena shooters in particular (ie. millenials who played too much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>). The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">last map update in January</a> saw developers Lemaitre Bros adding a homage to fanmade Counterstrike map Iceworld and Unreal Tournament's DM_Morbias. More recently, they've talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutalist-shooter-straftat-teases-a-four-player-free-for-all-mode">plans to bring 2v2 battles to the game</a>, and even a 4-player free-for-all mode likely to bring even more tense and comical chaos to the bloodsport.</p>
<p>Its adrenal simplicity made it one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">favourite games of 2024</a>. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">our review</a> Rick Lane called it "a wild overcorrection in response to the direction of modern multiplayer gunfests, one that careens straight through retro stations to arrive somewhere new and exciting." Also: it's fucking <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2386720/STRAFTAT/">FREE</a>. Absolutely absurd.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mario Kart and Rainbow Road go together like salt and pepper, or Bowser and foiled plans for world domination. Mario Kart World is the next cross-country chapter in the kart-racing genre, but a lack of Rainbow Road may be disturbing for some.</p>



<p>We all love the beast that is Bowser’s Castle, and there’s an element of discomfort about Ghost Valley that still gives us chills to this day. But when you think of a Mario Kart map sitting atop the mountain, it’s hard to look past Rainbow Road. Its look is iconic, most variations of the theme are hard, and it’s the Mario equivalent of a 1v1 on Rust.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> racing onto the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, all eyes are forward. We haven’t seen Rainbow Road in any pre-release material yet, so let’s see if it’s a chance for the track to have a breather.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world">Can You Play Rainbow Road in Mario Kart World?</h2>

<p><strong>Rainbow Road is included in Mario Kart World, and it seems like Nintendo is trying to keep its inclusion a secret for now.</strong></p>



<p>I’ll get onto the “secret” aspect of the track later, but you can breathe for now. Rainbow Road is in the new sequel, meaning we’re getting a brand-new RR-themed track, an amalgamation of previous RR tracks, older RR stages, or something else entirely.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-rainbow-road-leak-explained">Mario Kart World Rainbow Road Leak Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Nintendo Korea website posted a picture of the wider Mario Kart World map, showing a track design with Rainbow Road’s classic multicolored loops and bends.</strong></p>



<p>It’s been a tough time for the Nintendo Korea website since the Switch 2 properly came to the fore. Not only did it accidentally leak a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler</a> ahead of time, but it also had to take down the Rainbow Road image.</p>



<p>You can’t find the Rainbow Road image on the Nintendo Korea website anymore. Fortunately, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1jqrwq8/rainbow_road_has_finally_been_found_it_seems_it/?embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/icymi-mario-karts-iconic-track-looks-set-for-a-return-in-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart Reddit post</a> was on the ball. The OP’s two images show the Rainbow Road outline, and a zoomed-in version, giving us the official confirmation we’re all craving.</p>



<p>With The Nintendo Switch 2’s new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K, and HDR</a> possibilities, we’re very excited to see the best-looking Rainbow Road map ever!</p>

            <p>Microsoft has created a playable demo "inspired" by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> using its new AI tool, but it's practically unplayable.</p>

<p>Hosted in Copilot Labs and <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">playable in a web browser</a>, the demo "dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake 2", <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">according to a Q&amp;A</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake 2 running on a traditional game engine."</p>

<p>To be clear, then, this is not running the game using id's engine. Instead, Microsoft's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3#Sec7">Human Action Model</a> (WHAM) uses generative AI to dynamically predict the next action in the game based on analysing player data.</p>
<p>The results, though, are pretty appalling. It may resemble Quake 2, but the visuals (and enemies in particular) are blurry, the controls lag, and the frame-by-frame gameplay is enough to give you a headache.</p>
<p>Some of these limitations have been <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/whamm-real-time-world-modelling-of-interactive-environments/">acknowledged by Microsoft</a>, but worse of all is the context length at just 0.9 seconds of gameplay (which amounts to 9 frames at 10fps). Practically, that means the AI doesn't remember objects or level layouts, meaning if you look to the floor or ceiling and back again the view will have completely changed.</p>
<p>Is it interesting as an example of what AI can do now? Sure. Is it a playable demo? Barely.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> shared a video of the demo <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635">on social media</a>, which received plenty of ire in the replies.</p>
<p>"You can play Quake on a calculator bro why are you doing this in the most resource intensive way possible," reads one response. </p>
<p>"I don't know what this shit is but it ain't Quake," reads another.</p>
<p>Other responses have criticised Keighley himself for sharing the video, following his words at last year's The Game Awards responding to layoffs across the industry. "This feels extremely disconnected from what you said just four months ago  about the insane and devastating developer layoffs," reads a reply.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google also unveiled a similar tool</a> that can generate a playable 3D world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a>, it's clear, but even in the past year more of these supposed advancements have been released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-bananza-spoiler-accidentally-revealed-by-nintendo-korea-before-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has already shown off Donkey Kong Bananza as one of its biggest early exclusives. But Nintendo Korea looks to have dropped a clanger regarding a major character spoiler in the game.</p>



<p>Firstly, if the title hasn’t given this away already—<strong>there is a Donkey Kong Bananza spoiler here</strong>. If you read on, you know what you’re getting yourself into. But we have to make this declaration, as Nintendo Korea’s website apparently (and prematurely) went early with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DK Bananza</a> graphic.</p>



<p>In it, we see the return of a popular and legendary DK character. The news is sure to be <em>apeeling </em>to many <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-5-donkey-kong-appearances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong</a> Bananza-wanting fans.</p>



<p><strong>This is your final spoiler warning.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-korea-spoils-donkey-kong-bananza-character-return">Nintendo Korea Spoils Donkey Kong Bananza Character Return</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Seems sus to us. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Nintendo Korea website originally had a Donkey Kong Bananza graphic featuring a younger-looking <strong>Pauline</strong>—the legendary DK damsel in distress. The graphic has since been swapped—as you can see in our before and after image above—but thanks to this <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-koreas-website-seems-to-spoil-a-huge-detail-about-donkey-kong-bananza.1156071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra post</a>, the original evidence can still be seen.</p>



<p>Pauline has featured prominently throughout the annals of Donkey Kong history. She first appeared in the original 1981 debut of Donkey Kong, has since taken up a recurring role in countless Donkey Kong games (including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-vs-donkey-kong-princess-peach-showtime-sold-over-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong vs. Mario</a>), and has been a playable character in Super Smash Bros. and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart</a> franchises.</p>



<p>She looks unmistakably younger here, though. This leads fans to wonder if this is a prequel or if new character Odd Rock is connected to her. We look forward to finding out!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained.1156929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marathon is an all-new project from Bungie that’s set to act as a reboot of sorts to a game released in the 1990s. In the earliest materials released by the decades-old developer, we’ve been given snippets of a shooter that’s colourful and intriguing, but what’s the core premise here? Is Marathon an extraction shooter?</p>



<p>The extraction shooter genre is a tough one to break into, given how a few titles dominate the space. If Marathon is an extraction shooter, how well will it fare against the competition?</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>







<p><strong>Marathon is a traditional PvP extraction shooter with sci-fi vibes and cybernetic mercenaries.</strong> The core gameplay loop will see players accept a series of quests, gear up, load into one of three maps, and then attempt to extract successfully, all while fighting other players and digging up loot.</p>



<p>That’s as simple as the extraction shooter loop gets, but the kicker with Marathon is the setting.</p>



<p>It’s set in and around a ‘lost colony’ on Tau Ceti IV, a planet <strong>far </strong>from our own. Players will control ‘Runners’, cybernetic characters that are little more than soldiers of fortune. They’re in it for riches and rewards, and each raid into the world of Marathon is an opportunity to seize valuable loot and claim the gear of other players.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-multiplayer">Is Marathon Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>Marathon is a multiplayer game with a PvP model, which is typical for the extraction shooter genre.</p>



<p>It’s a survival title, and as it’s an extraction shooter, you can bet your last dollar it’s tougher than your average shooter.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has the top spot in the genre, and that’s one of the most punishing games ever made, so take that on board.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-loot-work-in-marathon">How Does Loot Work in Marathon?</h2>



<p>In 2023, Insider Gaming revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-early-details/">exclusive Marathon gameplay details</a>, breaking down how loot works in the game.</p>



<p>We revealed that loot is split up into three categories: loot, implants, and perks.</p>



<p>Players can unlock various items as they play, using implants to augment their character and perks to acquire new skills and abilities. It was also suggested by sources that Marathon will have a permadeath feature in some capacity, which could mean that each death in the game could come with catastrophic consequences.</p>

            <p>Japanese game stocks have dropped following the announcement of major tariffs on trade to the US.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs last week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>

<p>We are now seeing some of the impact these tariffs will have on companies. As shared by industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, on Monday morning at 10am Japan time, Nintendo's stock was down by 7.35 percent. Meanwhile, Sony has seen a drop of 10.16 percent, Bandai Namco -7.03 percent, Konami -3.93 percent, Sega -6.57 percent, Koei Tecmo -5.83 percent, Capcom -7.13 percent, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> -5.23 percent.</p>
<p>"The mobile game companies do even worse," Toto wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>

<p>Back in February, Sony took some preventative measures to protect itself from the then impending tariffs, which included stockpiling PlayStation 5's in the US. This will provide the PS5 maker a "temporary buffer against the impact of tariffs," Ahmad wrote over the weekend. However, as Ahmad notes, Sony's business is wider reaching than just its PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>As for the PS5, "Sony would need to assess how quickly it can move production of US units to Japan (lower tariff rate: 24 percent) and how many would be produced in China (higher tariff rate: 54 percent), and how quickly it can start producing in Vietnam (Est 2026)," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1908641169795674564">Ahmad wrote on X</a>.</p>
<p>"The firm would then need to evaluate how these tariffs impact current profit margins and how much they would need to increase hardware prices for the consumer. There could also be a potential impact on accessories and game pricing depending on how Sony wants to pass on costs."</p>
<p>Ahmad continued: "The good news is that the initial stockpiling + Japan manufacturing + PS5 being mid to late gen at this point (profitable on per unit basis) + <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> likely priced at $700 in anticipation of some potential tariff impact, means that even with a price increase, the increase may not be as significant as it would be for new tech products.</p>
<p>"However, there is still so much uncertainty around tariffs at this point, which won't actually go into effect until April 9, that no one knows if tariffs will end up higher, lower or removed entirely at some point."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/bungies-marathon-reveal-is-coming-on-saturday-12th-april/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie has announced that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> gameplay reveal will take place on 12th April, after their fans managed to complete an ARG to reveal the date of the reveal. Could you imagine if they hadn’t managed it in time?</p>
<p>Streaming at 6PM UK time / 7PM CEST / 1PM ET / 10AM PT, Bungie’s developers will debut Marathon gameplay alongside news and updates for the game. Here’s a teaser trailer with a pink robot cat in it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first new project from Bungie since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny</a>, Marathon is a PvPvE team-based extraction shooter set on the planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players will inhabit the bodies of cybernetic mercenaries known as Runners who can survive the planet’s harsh environment while searching the abandoned colony and surrounding planet for loot, including new weapons and gear.</p>
<p>It takes what feels like rather loose inspiration from Bungie’s 1994 FPS, Marathon, an early counterpart to Doom that was a Mac exclusive before spreading to PC with its sequel. The first game was set aboard a colony ship that was under attack by the S’pht and Pfhor alien races, while the ship’s AI gained sentience through a process known as Rampancy – a theme that carried forward to the Halo series. The sequels jetted across to other planets in the universe, delving into time travel and alternate realities.</p>

<p>But don’t expect that story to be told through this new game in anywhere near the same way – you can, at least, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/11/classic-marathon-free-steam/">play the originals for free</a>. Speaking back at the game’s reveal in 2023, Game Director Christopher Barrett said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Marathon is designed from the start as a PvP-focused game and won’t have a single-player campaign. Instead, with the PvP experience as our foundation, we’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot is riding on Marathon for the Bungie team, after difficulties that they faced through the last few years of Destiny 2. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/reports-destiny-spin-off-cancelled-and-the-final-shape-underperformed-but-bungie-layoffs-were-always-planned/">The studio went through a round of layoffs</a> following the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a>, with numerous projects cancelled or spun-off after a couple years of underperforming profits. That, it seemed, put the company’s pseudo-independence at risk, following its acquisition by Sony. With Bungie yet to really set out where Destiny can go in future, now that its decade-long main narrative has been wrapped up, and with live service games being far from a safe bet these days – just see Suicide Squad and Concord last year – this gameplay reveal is a big deal.</p>

            <p>Bungie have released a trailer for a trailer for extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>. Last week the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-gearing-up-to-reveal-something-about-marathon">teased the possibility of an announcement</a> with some cryptic tweets. The alien code was garbled but the message was clear: some substantial news about the upcoming FPS would likely be shared soon. We've still not heard that news, really. But now we at least know when it's coming, thanks to the teasey video of an off-screen gunfight featuring a pink cyborg cat. It is a visual missive for impatient fans: sit down and wait until this weekend.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A more thorough "gameplay reveal" will happen on Sat April 12th, at 6pm BST (that's 10am PDT for US folk), according to the text splashed on-screen at the end of this short video.</p>

<p>No idea what the cat is all about. Is this a cyber-critter who follows you about in-battle looking for scraps, or is it just a cute marketing mascot to earn easy love from animal lovers? Will you be able to pet this cat, or do you use it as a grenade? We'll know more this Saturday.</p>
<p>Bungie have been relatively quiet about Marathon since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">its reveal in 2023</a>. We know it's an extraction shooter with a PvP focus, and that it'll be set in the same universe as the Marathon games of the 1990s. But it's not a direct sequel or remake in the traditional sense. Fights will take place on the planet of Tau Ceti IV, and judging by the glitchy aesthetic, the rampant AI nemeses of the originals will doubtlessly come into play somehow. If you're deeply curious about the lore and background, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon Trilogy is free on Steam</a>. </p>
<p>The development of nu-Marathon has been troubled. Director Joe Ziegler reassured fans last October that work on the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">was ongoing</a>, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs at the studio</a> and the ousting of the game's previous director, Christopher Barrett, for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">allegations of misconduct</a> (a decision Barrett <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">has sued Sony over</a>). Bungie undoubtedly have stacks of faithful fans for whom <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> has offered years of shooty distraction, but they're now facing a much more difficult-to-crack live service environment, and a publisher that has no qualms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">eating their young</a>. In other words, the pressure is on for Marathon to be something more interesting than just another extraction shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-already-selling-for-enormous-amounts-on-ebay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many gamers are experiencing a serious case of FOMO over the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch successor has already been taking pre-orders across the UK, and sellers are listing their pre-orders to make amazing profits on eBay.</p>



<p>Most people want the latest and greatest items. This appears to be the case for Nintendo’s recently shown-off Switch 2. The epic console has been given a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and we’ve also got an insight into the cost of its games. However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console’s price</a> tag was a talking point after the Direct 2 Showcase.</p>



<p>Whatever you think of the Nintendo Switch 2’s price, it’s nothing compared to how much people are prepared to pay for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-are-already-live-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK pre-order</a> on eBay.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-can-buy-a-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-on-ebay-for-lots-of-money">You Can Buy a Nintendo Switch 2 Pre-Order on eBay For Lots of Money</h2>



<figure><figcaption>At least they’ll get to play. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the UK, you can grab a Switch 2 console on its own for £395.99 or £429.99 if bundled with a digital copy of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>. This is much more than the OG Switch, but it’s not surprising given the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new features</a>.</p>



<p>However, if you’ve been unable to secure a pre-order, you can battle it out with other <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;LH_Complete=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eBay</a> buyers who are spending over £600 for pre-orders! Completed sales of Switch 2 pre-orders range from anywhere between about <strong>£450 to £600 plus</strong>.</p>



<p>The most expensive one I’ve seen is for <strong>£628.92</strong>—with Mario Kart World included. Even still, this is <strong>£198.93</strong> over the original price. </p>



<p>We’re not here to tell anyone how much they should and shouldn’t want a Switch 2. This is simply a cautionary message that if you’re seeking a Switch 2 pre-order through eBay, you’ll need to pay way over the odds.</p>



<p>Head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IG Forum</a> and let us know what you think. Is the Switch 2 worth this much? Or are you better off waiting if you don’t have a pre-order secured?</p>

		<p>Neon Abyss 2 is filled with cyberpunk vibes, absurd over-the-top weapons, and some of the most modern and disquieting takes on gods going. It’s a vibrant nightmare of a roguelike with plenty of style and flair, but it also feels incredibly reminiscent of the first game. That’s obviously not a bad thing – why fix what isn’t broken? – and fans of the first game will already have this on their wish lists.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neon Abyss 2 | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A86PCFApasQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re once again thrown into the bright dystopia that has you fighting for your life after you drop out of a bar into the underworld. The general formula is much the same as it was before. That means you’ll be running around shooting things, trying to survive in different areas and gathering different currencies to then spend in shops and on upgrades. This doesn’t feel meaningfully different than the first game, but, to be fair, the first game felt very solid in this respect, so that’s fine.</p>


<p>Where the game does differ is in some of its general progression. The new Faith system basically lets you unlock special rooms as you’re playing that can have a variety of effects. Sometimes that means you’ll be able to gamble a lot of money to get fancy new items, sometimes it’ll be crafting, and sometimes it’ll just be an artifact of some kind. It makes it worth trying to play a little bit differently as you go, but you can often just sort of power through if you want as well.</p>


<p>The weapons feel better and more worthwhile now as well. Weapons have levels, with new ones often being higher level. However, if you decide to stick to the weapon you’ve fallen in love with, such as the gun that turns your eggs into a big old dragon to attack enemies with, then you can choose to stay faithful to it. If you do that, you can gain experience for the weapon to actually level it up, and when you do so you’ll get a reward. It’s a fun extra wrinkle in trying to decide what weapon to use.</p>
<p>There are some excellent choices now as well. Even the standard weapon fires a laser shot every so often, but you can get gloves that send out mighty long-range punches, weapons that convert your grenades into rockets, and a wide range of melee weapons that can slash through space. &nbsp;It’s pretty hard to argue with a katana that can cut through space and time, you know?</p>

<p>All-in-all, Neon Abyss 2 already feels very slick. A lot of the value of these kinds of roguelikes is hidden behind layers of secrets and unlocks though, so while I enjoyed my time with the preview build, I want to get my hands on the full version before settling into my thoughts on the game. For those who loved the first game and just want more though, you’ll be getting plenty of that with this follow-up, and you’re sure to enjoy some of the new systems and weapons as well. At least you don’t have too long to wait on that front.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-gaming-companies%E2%80%99-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs.1156893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/japanese-gaming-companies-shares-tank-due-to-us-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The burden of the US tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump is taking a heavy toll on the shares of Japanese gaming companies today. Sony was hit the hardest, losing just over 10% of its market value in a single session. Nintendo isn't far off, losing 7.85% today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Big N is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a>. Pre-orders were supposed to go live on Wednesday, April 9; however, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> in the United States precisely because of the aforementioned tariffs, and now users fear the console and its accessories might get even pricier. Needless to say, investors aren't keen on the impact this might have on the console's success, either.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo, known for Dynasty Warriors, Ninja Gaiden, and Atelier among others, is losing 7.63%. Bandai Namco, publisher of franchises like Ace Combat, Dark Souls, Dragon Ball, and Tekken just to name a few, is losing 7.37%. SEGA Sammy, the legendary publisher of franchises like Shenmue, Virtua Fighter, Like a Dragon, Sonic, and Total War, is close by with -7.29%. CAPCOM, another revered Japanese gaming company (Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, etc.), loses 6.61%. Square Enix (Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Star Ocean) loses 5.62%. Lastly, KONAMI is currently down 'only' 5.19%. The latter company has relied less on videogaming for some time, although that is changing rapidly with the revival of beloved franchises such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the tariffs will probably hit Western game companies just as hard as they are doing with Japanese ones. However, due to the timezone, this is the first glimpse we have at how the industry (which is already ailing due to increased budgets and stifled growth) is reacting to the application of the US tariffs. It's not looking good, that's for sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ashton-hall-gaming-latest-video-bag/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ashton Hall, the viral personality behind the sensational ‘morning routine’ videos, has uploaded a new clip comparing his life in 2018 to 2025. It can be interpreted as a veiled bag on gaming – in the 2018 segment, he’s playing games multiple times a day and raging at cutscenes on Grand Theft Auto 5, for some reason.</p>



<p>However, when he hangs up the controller (which was never even switched on), he becomes a new man, waking up at 3 AM and plunging his face into ice bowls before making thousands of dollars in the blink of an eye.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plot-holes">Plot Holes</h2>



<p>Ashton Hall has become a phenomenally successful creator following the viral trend around his morning routine videos. In the clips he has uploaded across social media, Hall has shown what his daily routine looks like, revealing a morning schedule that unfolds over several hours, prompting parodies worldwide.</p>



<div><article><p><span>2018 vs. 2025. First 4 hours will change everything ⏰</span></p></article></div>







<p>In his latest video uploaded to Twitter, Hall shows himself ‘in 2018’, playing video games in a dinky apartment, relying on snack foods and carbonated beverages for sustenance, and doom-scrolling on social media.</p>



<p>He becomes enraged at a cutscene on Grand Theft Auto 5 on PS4, throwing a controller that was never even powered on at the television, shattering it on impact. Later, he’s seen playing the same game on the same television set, so I’m not sure what to believe at this point.</p>



<p>His classic skewed timelines are also front and centre – it takes him 12 minutes to power on the controller after picking it up from a nightstand.</p>



<p>But it’s okay because after ditching the video games, Hall became a much better man with a regimented morning schedule that involves rubbing bananas on his face and spending four minutes suspended in mid-air over a swimming pool, so there’s that.</p>



<p>Generational run, indeed.</p>

            <p>Bungie will finally reveal details of its next game, Marathon, later this week.</p>
<p>The Destiny maker released a teaser video for a Marathon Gameplay Reveal, which will take place on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/MARATHONTHEGAME">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarathonTheGame">YouTube</a> on 12th April at 6pm UK time (10am PDT).</p>
<p>The teaser itself shows a character running through a bright jungle chased by some sort of robot or mech, though we don't see a full shot of either. We do, however, see an adorable pink cat curl up next to the (presumably dying) figure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Bungie first announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>The original Marathon first-person shooter was released in 1994 and received two sequels. Now, Bungie is reviving the series as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that's set in the same universe as the original games.</p>
<p>Marathon will be the first new project from Bungie since Halo and Destiny, set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV where players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries Runners.</p>
<p>It's aiming for release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Marathon game was released on Steam for free</a>.</p>
<p>Then in October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">Marathon game director Joe Ziegler gave an update to explain the gameplay loop</a> but stated it was too early to show gameplay and more would be shown next year.</p>
<p>Now it's next year and, true to its word, Bungie is finally set to show off the game in action.</p>
<p>News of the game has been tainted by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">dismissal of former project lead Chris Barrett</a> following alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Switch 2 listings have popped up on the likes of eBay, as retailers run out of stock following pre-orders going live.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo gave us all a much closer look at its upcoming Switch successor. Along with an overview of games and such, it also gave us a release date and retail price - Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>However, once pre-orders went live, stock soon ran out, with places such as Argos already out of stock. "Sorry, this item is just too popular! But we may get more stock, so do check back at a later date," reads a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickPR=plp:1:9">notice on Argos' website</a>.</p>

<p>And, as to be expected, given this high demand, listings for the Switch 2 are now popping up on eBay, above that recommended retail price. At the time of writing, there are multiple Switch 2 listings via the online auction site in excess of £600.</p>
<p>On the completed sales side of things, one Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle was sold for £634.02, which is £204.03 more than the recommended retail price. A Switch 2 console without Mario Kart World included, meanwhile, has sold for £554.45.</p>
<p>While retailers such as Argos and Smyths have opened pre-orders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping by implementing an invite-only system. Emails have started going out for those fortunate to be selected.</p>

			<p>With a brief teaser trailer, Bungie has <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1909021981275533601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Marathon gameplay reveal showcase will take place on Saturday, April 12, at 10 AM Pacific Time.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game revives the developer's sci-fi franchise, which was originally created in the 1990s. However, this time around, the genre is the trending extraction shooter. The development had a bit of a bumpy road, between the studio's layoffs and the scandal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved the former Marathon game director</a>.</p>
<p>We don't know much about the game, though the developers did share a few details. The new director recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gets-small-developer-update-from-bungie-confirming-expanded-playtesting-and-upcoming-news-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that users will be provided with many different tools to find in the game, such as weapons and equipment that changes their character's stats or modify some of their capabilities, such as healing consumables.</p>
<p>Players will pick a Runner character before entering the game. Each Runner has a few abilities that the player can further customize. While within the game, users will be assigned several objectives, each coming with its own risks and rewards. Furthermore, if the player cannot extract successfully, they'll lose all the loot they had gathered during the session.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marathon | Save the Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Earlier, the former Game Director had <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that player actions would influence the persistent world in Marathon.</p>
<p><em>We’re creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold, stories that are integrated with the overarching game narrative. We’re building a world full of persistent, evolving zones, where players create their own journey with every run they take. That might mean an unforgettable firefight against another crew vying for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while beset on all sides.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond just the “story of your last run”, however, we want to give players the chance to affect these persistent zones and the larger world as a result. For example, imagine a crew discovering a previously undiscovered artifact that, when activated, opens a new area of the map for all players to explore. In essence, at Bungie, we’re creating a game where the actions of players can have ramifications for the world and players with each unfolding season.</em></p>
<p>Marathon will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with cross-play enabled between all platforms to unify the community.</p>
