		<p>Nintendo has announced Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition for Nintendo Switch, coming out on 30th March 2025 for the game’s 10th anniversary, and removing one more reason to keep you Wii U plugged in… or maybe even to keep it at all!</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Coming March 20th, 2025 (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKHz71V7Csc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition promises to enhance the sci-fi RPG epic on its way to the Switch, with the original game pushing the Wii U to the limits and making certain sacrifices to stick to 30FPS – though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaYfIdZ-_a0">it did manage to hold this target a lot</a>.</p>


<p>The Definitive Edition does also promise some new story elements. It’s not clear what this will be, and could be integrated into the main story alongside other side-missions and quests, or a separate addendum, similar to what we’ve seen with the most recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles remaster</a>.</p>
<p>Compared to other entries in the series, there’s a pretty big tonal shift for Xenoblade Chronicles X, with more of a sci-fi feel, some clashing art styles, and more. The game takes us to the year 2054 with Earth destroyed in the crossfire of an alien war, and just a small number of survivors surviving to make it to the planet Mira. It’s up to you to explore this land as part of BLADE, help found New Los Angeles, and take on online missions and grand multiplayer Global Nemesis Battles for up to 31 players – the online is returning for this Nintendo Switch remaster.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is one of the last major Nintendo Wii U games that will be ported to Nintendo Switch – and quite possibly doing so right around the launch of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/"> the anticipated Switch successor</a>. Pretty much everything else, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/09/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review/">Mario</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">platformers</a>, to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review/">Donkey Kong</a>, and even other niche JRPGs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/15/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-encore-review/">Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore</a> have been ported across. At this point, it’s really just the run-of-the-mill sports and Mario RPGs, and games that can only work with the Wii U Gamepad’s second screen that are trapped on the system – your <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/04/22/affordable-space-adventures-review/">Affordable Space Adventures</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review/">Star Fox Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review/">Star Fox Guard</a>, Nintendo Land are the last few standouts (for better or worse)</p>
<p>Looking back at the original release and our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X review</a>, Dom said, “Xenoblade Chronicles X is a genuinely enthralling game. It doesn’t take it easy on you though, and the perseverance and attention required may override the spectacle and beauty found here. Fans of the last game may also struggle with the tonal and technical shift, but if you want to experience one of the most involving, creative and expansive open worlds ever created, Xenoblade Chronicles X is essential.”</p>

			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is a game that was previously only available on <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">the Wii U</a>, with the game being released in 2015. However, the game is now making a return and will be coming to the Nintendo Switch with enhanced visuals, new story elements, and much more. For those excited to get their hands on it, this definitive edition will be releasing on 20 March, 2025. To celebrate the announcement of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Nintendo has released a trailer that showcases the graphics, the story, and some of the gameplay features that players can expect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Coming March 20th, 2025 (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tKHz71V7Csc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this title, you'll be able to customize your Avatar to look how you want them to, and you get to pick their class as well, which gives you a ton of variety with how expansive the battle system is. Of course, before you get to utilize a Skell, you have to prove yourself to the BLADE organization. Once you've done that, you'll be able to have your very own customizable mech that will help with exploring the vast world of Xenoblade Chronicles X, as well as help you in combat.</p>
<p>This game takes place in the year 2054, where humans have fled Earth due to an intergalactic war. You are one of the remaining survivors of the New Los Angeles (NLA) colony, and you have to help them build a new home on the planet Mira.</p>
<p>As you help them get settled on Mira, you'll get to know some of the people from NLA, help them with their problems, and build bonds with your party members, which will later unlock new quests that can lead to rare gear and items. There will also be multiplayer-specific missions to take part in, allowing you to team up with friends online to play Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition together. If you want to play multiplayer but don't want to team up, you can also take part in Global Nemesis Battles, full of fun and chaos.</p>
<p>If you find that you don't like the characters in the game as party members, you can also recruit the avatars of other players to your team so that they can help you through the main story, somewhat similar to the Pawn system in Dragon's Dogma.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get your hands on this game, you <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can pre-order it now</a>, with the title costing $59.99.</p>
<p>Is Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition a game you'll be picking up?</p>

Spooky season is coming to a climax and then an abrupt close, but that doesn’t mean you can’t keep enjoying horror experiences for the remainder of the fall. Thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/scream&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/scream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam’s ongoing Halloween sale</a></span> which <strong>runs till November 4, </strong>you’ll even have some more time than usual to sort through the wealth of great deals and pick out the perfect horror experience for yourself. We’re also here to help, so here’s a handful (or two) of great sales on horror games going on Steam at the moment.</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>Her Story</em> creator Sam Barlow, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortality-sam-barlow-horror-video-game-ps5-pc-1849470910"><em>Immortality</em></a></span>, is also easily his most horrific. Following the disappearance of actress Marissa Marcel, you are mysteriously gifted footage of her only three movies, each resembling a similar film or style of film of its respective era. There’s an erotic thriller based on the actual Gothic novel <em>The Monk</em>, a <em>Klute</em>-like detective movie set in New York, and a feature that cast Marissa as both a pop star <em>and </em>her lookalike. As you sift through the footage of the films—as well as behind-the-scenes content, wrap parties, table readings, and production meetings—disturbing revelations about what exactly happened to Marissa come to light through what can only be described as supernatural tricks and devilry. </p><p><em>Immortality </em>is occasionally maddening as it challenges the player to match-cut scenes and characters in order to produce a logical timeline of events, but it is also bewitching. <strong>It’s unlike anything I played before it, and it’s unlike anything I’ve played since. </strong>Y<strong>ou can see what I mean by picking up </strong><em><strong>Immortality </strong></em><strong>for just $10. </strong><br></p></div><div><p>What’s scarier than other people? The other people that you find in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dayz&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dayz"><em>DayZ</em></a></span>, specifically. This long-running survival-horror MMO feels like the only experience to really capture what <em>The Walking Dead</em>’s world might feel like in a game. Zombies, which populate the dilapidated post-apocalyptic Russian overworld, aren’t the real threat. The real danger is the need to survive the elements, stay well-fed, and ultimately, outlive other players scrounging for the same weapons and resources as you. </p><p>A few <em>DayZ </em>clones have come and gone since the initial <em>ARMA 2 </em>mod was released, but it<em> </em>still remains the king. I regularly get videos on my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiktok.com/@tnf_sharpshooter/video/7407512902107680042?q=dayz&amp;t=1730210045564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiktok.com/@tnf_sharpshooter/video/7407512902107680042?q=dayz&amp;t=1730210045564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiktok</a></span> or Twitter algorithms of people who are still logging in to <em>DayZ </em>for its unrivaled immersive qualities. <strong>Whether you want a deep roleplaying experience out of it or just a taste of a hardcore survival game, </strong><em><strong>DayZ </strong></em><strong>might just be the perfect horror game to pick up this season, and you can get it for $25 now.</strong></p></div><div><p>A few years ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitchs-latest-horror-sensation-phasmophobia-has-stre-1845362213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitchs-latest-horror-sensation-phasmophobia-has-stre-1845362213"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a></span> appeared out of nowhere and took the world by storm. Before I knew it, everyone in my friend circles was trekking through haunted locales and screaming at the top of their lungs as unseen paranormal forces stirred and struck them down one by one. I still haven’t tried my hand at <em>Phasmophobia</em>, but it damn sure has been fun watching my friends try their hand at ghostbusting and utterly failing in hilarious fashion. <strong>The game just made it to consoles, but if you’ve got a PC and a fun group, why not pick up </strong><em><strong>Phasmophobia </strong></em><strong>for just $15?</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>casts players as wannabe ghost hunters, but <em>Lethal Company </em>takes a slightly different approach to a similar premise. In it, you are workers dropped into settings that are <em>known </em>to be plagued by certain monsters. In fact, you are explicitly sent in pursuit of scrap and resources to sell to an ambiguous “Company” despite the fact that these monsters will almost definitely get to you. Turn on proximity chat and get into the habit of regularly shouting for your friends throughout the barren halls of the abandoned factories the work sends you to. The job will almost assuredly go wrong to hilarious effect. </p><p>I have been gored by monsters, left behind because I was thought dead, blown up, <em>and </em>I believe shot by a friendly turret the majority of the times that I’ve played <em>Lethal Company</em>.<strong> If you prefer to be hunted by increasingly bizarre and horrifying monsters rather than ghosts,, </strong><em><strong>Lethal Company</strong></em><strong>’s a great time with friends and it can be yours for $7.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Upon emerging from your walk in the woods, you find a cabin on a hill. You enter that cabin and descend down into its basement to find a woman chained to a wall. Only that’s no mere woman, that’s the princess you’ve come to slay, and this job isn’t going to be an easy one. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-review-black-tabby-games-horror-1851000305"><em>Slay the Princess</em></a></span><em> </em>is an exceptionally clever visual novel that has <em>so many </em>branching possibilities that it’s hard to put names to them all, let alone chart how they feed into one another. You will become intimately familiar with that cabin and that princess as you play through those events I outlined again and again <em>and again</em>. Much as it can feel like you’re going in circles, though, every one of those loops brings you a step closer to the truth about your own motivations here and those of the princess…or whatever she <em>really </em>is. <em><strong>Slay the Princess </strong></em><strong>is an exceptionally winding horror tale and it just got </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-pristine-cut-review-update-new-routes-1851678749&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-princess-pristine-cut-review-update-new-routes-1851678749"><strong>expanded upon, entirely for free</strong></a></span><strong>. Now it’s discounted for Halloween, and you should pick it up while it’s $14.39.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>There isn’t much that needs to be said about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/l4d2-left-4-dead-2-broken-fast-sequel-valve-anacrusis-1851043368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/l4d2-left-4-dead-2-broken-fast-sequel-valve-anacrusis-1851043368"><em>Left 4 Dead 2</em></a></span><em> </em>at this point in time. It’s <em>still </em>one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam, enjoys a healthy mod scene, and is a triumphant sequel that built on the already impeccable foundation of its inimitable predecessor. By now, it<em> </em>should just be software that’s already downloaded onto freshly delivered PCs and consoles. <em><strong>Left 4 Dead 2 </strong></em><strong>is quite literally $1 right now, so quit playing around and get it already.</strong></p></div><div><p>One of my favorite horror settings in games is in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a></span>, a <em>Souls</em>-ish Metroidvania that is definitely not a particularly scary game. Still, at a certain point in your travels, you are bound to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/hollow-knight/hollow-knights-ingenious-map-system-ensures-theres&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/hollow-knight/hollow-knights-ingenious-map-system-ensures-theres" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fall into Deepnest</a></span>, a horrifying pit in the heart of Hallownest, <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s underground bug kingdom. There is little light here, obscuring some of your view, and there’s not really any music here either. Instead, you’re forced to constantly listen to the chitter of bugs that can be seen writhing in the foreground of the environments. It is the worst place imaginable, and one of the greatest highlights of the immensely varied and deeply layered world of <em>Hollow Knight</em>, the second best game ever, just behind <em>Bloodborne</em>. <strong>You can own </strong><em><strong>Hollow Knight </strong></em><strong>for $7.49, and you should. </strong></p></div><div><p>I’m a sucker for a game that looks and feels vintage, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span><em> </em>is definitely that. Styled after PS1 games, and more specifically <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-3-original-trilogy-bundle-gog-1851662547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-3-original-trilogy-bundle-gog-1851662547">classic <em>Resident Evil</em></a></span>, it features a low-poly look, fixed camera angles, and obscure puzzles that feel like true sendups of the survival-horror genre’s roots. It’s the latest in a recent string of indie success stories that have been deliberate throwbacks, showing that there’s an audience for the stuff that we thought we’d outgrown, when really there’s a place for the old and new. <strong>To see what I mean, pick up <em>Crow Country </em>while it’s $16 right now.</strong></p></div><div><p>I first played <em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>at a friend’s birthday a little over a year ago, and while I was zooted out of my mind for most of the trip, the experience of playing it has stuck with me with resounding clarity. While we were all huddled together around a couch in our Airbnb, one of the members of our group took the reins of the game, which grants players access to security cameras around a certain setting. Sometimes it’s an office, or a house, but there’s always something <em>wrong </em>with it, or at least there eventually will be. You scan the perimeter at first to see what it all looks like when things are normal, and then eventually, “anomalies” occur that either subtly displace things or visibly worsen the situation.</p><p>At first, I was struck by how mundane it all was. <em>I’m On Observation Duty</em>’s action felt a bit slow to start, and I think the room was feeling it too, since we were mostly divining what object had moved two inches to the right. But just as it felt like we might turn in, things escalated. <em>Things </em>began to appear, and elements of the environment became visibly distorted. The barks from our crew grew from murmurs to full-on shouts, as the anomalies of the game became more aggressive and haunted. At least one person nearly lept off the couch out of fear, and before long, I’d noticed that my grip on the couch’s arm had tightened over the session. Whether I cared to admit it or not, I was scared and having a wonderful time. </p><p>I’m rarely a passive participant to horror in games. I’m typically on the sticks myself, and usually alone in a room when I do play a horror game, but <em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>was one of my favorite experiences because it was time spent getting spooked with some incredible people. Horror is such a social genre, it only makes sense that one of the few times I open myself up to enjoying it with other people in the room, it blows most other titles out of the water despite its simplicity. If you do pick it up, corral your funniest friends into a call or the same room, because it’s a blast this way.<br></p><p><em>I’m On Observation Duty </em>is a series of short horror games, and <strong>most of them are discounted for the ongoing Halloween sale for anywhere between two to three dollars</strong>. <strong>Alternatively, if you’ve decided that this premise sounds like your kind of shit, you can pick up a collection with all seven titles in the </strong><em><strong>I’m On Observation Duty</strong></em><strong> series for about $33.</strong><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The final expansion of Alan Wake 2, The Lake House, is out now, closing a chapter for Remedy that was 13 years in the making. In The Lake House, players assume the role of Agent Kiran Estevez as she investigates the titular Federal Bureau of Control satellite station following a disturbance. The high strangeness of Remedy's Control mixes with the horror of Alan Wake 2, giving the expansion the feeling of both an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-expansion-is-both-an-epilogue-and-prologue/1100-6527270/">epilogue and a prologue</a>, as the studio continues to build out its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-alan-wake-2-reveals-about-the-remedy-connected-universe/2900-4952/">connected universe, the RCU</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently caught up with the DLC's star, Janina Gavankar, whom you may know from things like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and True Blood. Gavankar explained what she loves about working with Remedy, why she's hoping to do it again soon, and whether we can expect to see her in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/control-2/" data-ref-id="5000-575910">Control's sequel</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been stalking Remedy and Sam [Lake] for eight years," Gavankar said. "Quantum Break was my first Remedy game, and I loved it so much. I found all three acts of [in-universe movie script] Time Knife, and I invited some of the cast over, and I made a soundboard so I could play effects, and I streamed a live reading of it. I think that's when Sam and other people at Remedy realized, 'Oh, <em>she's like us</em>.'"</p><p dir="ltr">From the outside, it seems like many collaborators have become lifelong friends of the studio. Quantum Break's Shawn Ashmore, for example, is always rooting for the studio online. Why is it that Remedy creates these bonds with so many who come into the company's orbit? "Everybody goes into Remedy and comes out even more invested than when they started. You're seeing that over and over," she told me."I'm lucky to call Sam a close friend now. He's just as wonderful as he is weird [...] At this point, I have starred in major releases. I have been consulting at both independent and triple-A studios for over half a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">"And every organism is different. You, as a reporter, know that; you can feel that. You've talked to them all, and I've worked for them all," Gavankar continued. "So, when you come upon a company like Remedy, that has a maestro, you can feel it. The lucky thing, in this case, is that the maestro is a good person and still so enthusiastic and energetic about working with artists--he's not a star f***er. I've been around those guys, too, and they're talented, sure, but you can tell the difference between somebody who is chasing Hollywood and someone who's really an auteur in the medium that matters the most, which, to me, is games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4391893"></a><figcaption>It seems likely we haven't seen the last of Agent Estevez in Remedy's expansive story universe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4391893-1%285%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given Agent Estevez is an FBC agent, she seems well-suited to be in the previously announced Control sequel. On top of that, Remedy clearly enjoys working with the same collaborators repeatedly, with actors such as Matthew Poretta, Shawn Ashmore, Courtney Hope, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/max-payne-voice-actor-james-mccaffrey-the-heart-of-remedy-games-dies-at-65/1100-6520015/">late, great James McCaffrey</a> all having worked on multiple Remedy games, sometimes spanning several decades. It sure does seem like we could see Estevez again. Gavankar couldn't confirm my theory, but she liked the idea very much.</p><p dir="ltr">"Please say all of that to Sam. Did you talk to him yet? Please tell him all of that," she joked. "Tell him how perfectly seamlessly she fits into everything. I agree."</p><p dir="ltr">With her character mixed up in the RCU, I asked Gavankar how much she tries to make sense of it all or whether she focuses merely on Estevez's role and leaves the theory-crafting for others. "Oh, it all makes sense to me. But also, as a writer, I write high strangeness as well. So we get along very well, me and Remedy. I don't flinch at any of these things," she told me, echoing a Stephen King quote heard in the opening moments of 2010's Alan Wake vouching for the "unexplained mystery."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an artist, you don't want to explain everything away--like those Ending Explained videos, I hate them because [they take] away any agency from the audience members. It's okay to believe that your audience is smart enough to figure it out for themselves. Also, it might fit somewhere in their human experience in a way that you didn't intend, and that is so much more important than explaining what your point was."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2's The Lake House expansion is out now and marks the last story update for the game. Along with the previous expansion, Night Springs, it's included in the Deluxe Edition, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-physical-edition-preorders-are-live-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x/1100-6524001/">finally available as a physical release</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though a sequel to Control is in development, the next game from Remedy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a three-player co-op PvE game set in the Remedy Connected Universe.</p>

                <p>Grinding Gear Games has announced that Path of Exile 2's early access launch has been delayed from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-launches-in-early-access-this-november/1100-6525988/" data-ref-id="1100-6525988">November 15</a> to December 6. This is due to server-side infrastructure work that's taking longer than anticipated.</p><p>According to game director Jonathan Rogers, the studio intends to keep its promises of allowing microtransactions from the first game to carry to the second game. Not only do new systems have to be built, but the developers also have to make sure that old data from the first game is backwards compatible with them as well. The developers also have to conduct load testing to make sure that the game doesn't fall apart at launch.</p>

<p>Rogers also explained that he believes the original launch date could have been met, but not without making mistakes. "We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for, and nobody has their account broken," he said in a video.</p><p>There will be a livestream in about four weeks to show what players can expect during the early access period. Path of Exile 2 is a top-down action role-playing game where players can choose between 12 different character classes. The storyline will have six acts, and endgame content includes more than 100 maps with their own boss fights and modifiers.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While it was originally supposed to be an expansion of the first game, Path of Exile 2 will have new features such as local couch co-op, cross-play, and cross-progression.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-revealed-for-march.1022061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo and Monolith Soft have announced <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</i>, a remastered version of the 2015 Wii U JRPG&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>.</p>

<p>Launching on March 20th,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>looks to be doing for its parent game what 2020's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-announced-for-switch">did for the first game</a> in the series.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about what kind of enhancements we can expect from this remaster, other than that it will be "visually enhanced" and that it'll also feature new story elements, although we don't know what those story elements are yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=ufcTCqEX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-remaster-free-roaming.jpg?itok=Z_rx5lQL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is finally getting a remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, it's a JRPG from 2015 that is, believe it or not, part of the overarching&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Although it bears the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>name, it's not actually narratively connected to any previous entries in the series, although you'll likely recognize some common elements and themes if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Unlike other&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>games, you play as a custom-created character in&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>. When you awake from a lifepod after a crash-landing on an alien planet, you must help humanity to explore and colonize this planet, dealing with its dangers as you go.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>offers similar action-RPG gameplay to its predecessors, although the core exploration gameplay is much more about cataloguing and surveying a new planet.</p>




<p>At first, you'll be exploring the beautiful and savage planet of Mira on foot, but after a while, you'll gain access to a mech with which you can reach certain areas and defeat certain enemies more easily.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a line of Wii U games to get Switch remasters. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-announced-for-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a>, horror game&nbsp;<em>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/wonderful-101-remastered-preview">quirky actioner&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> on March 20th.</p>

It’s not coming — at least, not for a while. In an <a href="https://play.date/stereo-dock/">update to the Stereo Dock’s page</a>, the company describes the challenges it faced in getting a good prototype, but says that, in the end, the device didn’t meet its standards. </p></div><p>The Stereo Dock was going to be a small desktop Bluetooth speaker and pen holder that you could attach a Playdate to. Panic first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523929/playdate-preorder-game-lineup-dock-announced">announced the Stereo Dock</a> in 2021, when it was still working toward releasing the Playdate. </p><p>On the web page, the company describes the unexpected challenges it faced getting the Stereo Dock to market: </p><div><blockquote><p>What happened? Well, our first regret was assuming that our factory at that time — a factory that made lots of Bluetooth speakers — could easily design the electronics for us, saving us lots of time and money. That went pretty well at first. But they, in turn, outsourced the Bluetooth software and chipset to&nbsp;<strong>another</strong>&nbsp;company in&nbsp;<strong>another </strong>country.</p><p>As a result, the Stereo Dock would crash often — rapidly adjusting the volume would do it. The Bluetooth pairing/unpairing experience was rough. And when we played music, it just didn’t sound very good. The back-and-forth between three companies trying to fix bugs became a huge challenge. And worst of all: the cost of the Stereo Dock kept getting higher and higher.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>The Playdate Stereo Dock could still happen someday.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Panic</cite></p></div><p>Ultimately, Panic says it had to “hit pause” on the Stereo Dock, because it was spending more money developing the device than it would likely make back, and the prototypes, while “beautiful,” weren’t good enough. “And if we’re going to ship a product,” the company writes, “it has to be, at least, good.” </p><p>In the meantime, Panic says it’s focusing on the Playdate, “as our new factory comes online and production once again resumes.” The company plans to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278678/dont-panic">showcase some updates</a> and surprises on October 31st at 1PM ET.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24276043/apple-new-usb-c-magic-mouse-charging-port-bottom"><h2>Apple put the Magic Mouse’s charging port on the bottom again</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279307/apple-mac-m4-updates-news-announcements"><h2>All the news from Apple’s ‘week’ of Mac announcements</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24273124/apple-imac-m4-chip-announced-price-release-date"><h2>Apple updates the iMac with new colors and an M4 chip</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282533/amazon-mac-mini-leak-specs-m4-size"><h2>Amazon leaks tiny Mac Mini with M4 Pro</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24275569/apple-usb-c-magic-keyboard-mouse-trackpad-no-lightning"><h2>Apple’s new Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad have USB-C</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it feels fitting that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>, a beloved but mostly overlooked game from 2015, will end up being part of the current console’s end-of-life send-off. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em> arrives on March 20, 2025, with enhanced visuals and new story beats. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> is a futuristic game about trying to rebuild humanity on a distant and hostile planet called Mira. The large-scale world is full of giant monsters to fight, mechs to customize and ride, and lots of MMO-style fetch quests and resource harvesting. There’s also multiplayer-specific missions and Global Nemesis Battles in addition to all of the existing character affinities and skill trees to manage. </p><p>It’s Monolith Soft’s immediate follow-up to <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> for the Wii, and had a bit more of the mech-infused flavor of studio cofounder Tetsuya Takahashi’s previous RPG series,<em> Xenogears </em>and<em> Xenosaga</em>. It’s also precisely the sort of game that would benefit from some Definitive Edition cleanup, and possibly even the added horsepower of a Switch 2 whenever it finally arrives. </p><p>In the meantime, it’s exciting to see the entire <em>Xenoblade</em> series up to this point in one place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-3-nintendo-switch-jrpg-impressions-1849357306"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em></a></span> and its beefy expansion were excellent, and while I can’t wait to see what Monolith Soft does next, an upgrade port of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is the perfect thing to tide fans over unit its next project is officially announced. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The highly popular computer game from the 1970s, The Oregon Trail, is being turned into an action-comedy movie by Apple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/oregon-trail-movie-apple-1236045454/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-oregon-trail-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>), The Oregon Trail is receiving a movie adaptation by Apple. Will Speck and Josh Gordon will direct and produce the movie. The duo is responsible for movies like Blades of Glory and Office Christmas Party.</p>



<p>Moreover, Oscar winners The Lucas Bros. and Max Reisman will be responsible for writing the screenplay that follows the journey of a 19th-century pioneer on the Oregon Trail. Emmy winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul will be brought on to provide original music. The movie is also rumoured to have “a couple of original musical numbers in the vein of Barbie.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Oregon Trail was a computer game that exploded in popularity in the 1990s. It was developed by Bill Heinemann, Don Rawitsch, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and released by MECC in 1974. The game’s goal was to “teach school children about the life of a 19th-century pioneer on the Oregon Trail,” where the students could be a wagon leader who guides a group of settlers.</p>



<p>Oregon Trail received a remake from GameLoft in 2022. The remake featured new playable journeys, upgraded visuals, and other enhancements while staying faithful to the source material. The game’s most famous aspect has been the multiple hazards you can face on your journeys, including broken limbs, snakebites, many diseases, and even dysentery.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its release next year.</p>
<p>"The year is 2054. Humans have fled Earth amidst a destructive intergalactic war. As one of the survivors and a member of the New Los Angeles (NLA) colony, the mission is to help build a new home on the sprawling, hostile planet Mira," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"This seamless open world across five otherworldly continents is teeming with unknown creatures – some of which are epic in scale – and players will fight for the future of humanity." You can check out a trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition below.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will include added story elements, as well as customisable avatars on release. Meanwhile, players will be able unlock a "powerful" Skell, but only once they have done what they need to prove themselves to the BLADE organisation. A Skell, for those unfamiliar, is a giant mech that will aid in exploration across Mira.</p>
<p>The game will also feature some multiplayer-specific missions. Nintendo notes a Switch Online membership and a Nintendo Account are required for online play.</p>
<p>The addition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition to the Switch library now means every game in the series is playable on one console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> 1 - 3.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 received a glowing review from Eurogamer</a> in 2022, described as "a JRPG masterpiece".</p>
<p>While Xenoblade Chronicles X shares thematic references with the other games in the series, it is a standalone story and considered one of the best games on the Wii U. Now it follows plenty of other Nintendo-published games with a swanky Switch port.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will release on 20th March next year, for Nintendo Switch. No mention of that elusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console.</p>
<p>If you are yet to play Xenoblade Chronicles X, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Eurogamer's original review from 2015</a>, where we called it "majestic, vibrant, almost peerlessly handsome".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following the expiration of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard review embargo, lots of media and industry people have started sharing their thoughts on BioWare's latest RPG, including Larian Studios Director of Publishing Michael Douse. In a lengthy tweet <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1850949592667590700?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on X, Douse showered the game with high praise:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard in complete secrecy (behind my backpack at the office in front of a giant window, in the kitchen). From me, you may be wondering “is this a game compatible with my experience during BG3” so I’ll tackle it from that perspective. </em><em>The answer is yes. It is to a heavy, 9 season long show what a well-made, character driven, binge-worthy Netflix series is.</em></p>
<p><em>It has a good sense of propulsion and forward momentum. The combat system is honestly brilliant (to me, a mix of Xenoblade &amp; Hogwarts which is giga-brain genius). It knows when it needs a tentpole narrative moment, and it knows when to let you toy around with your class and exploit some of its stronger elements. </em><em>More important, to me, it feels like the first Dragon Age game that truly knows what it wants to be.</em></p>
<p><em>In short, if you want some character driven romping with a strong combat system in a universe you know, love, or have heard of, it is much better than the average action game, and much less heavy than the gargantuan RPGs that may intimidate at times. In a word, it’s fun!</em></p>
<p><em>To me, I’m extremely happy BioWare gets to stick around - presumably - in these uncertain (because of moronic corporate greed) times. An existential game, and a fun one at th</em>at.</p>
<p>As I jokingly replied via tweet, it was not quite <em>complete </em>secrecy. I have known Michael for years and have him on my Steam friends list, so I noticed he was playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard while I was also going through it for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. Having said that, as you already know if you read my evaluation of the game, I wholeheartedly agree with Douse's assessment of BioWare's latest work. It should definitely appeal to franchise fans but also to those who enjoyed games like Larian's own masterpiece Baldur's Gate 3. It's different, but there are many common threads that will make fans of Western RPGs happy if they give it a chance.</p>
<p>The game is out in two days on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you.1021995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K represents a shift in Intel’s strategy, focusing on power efficiency over raw performance. It’s part of the new Core Ultra 200S series, bringing promises of lower energy consumption, cooler temperatures, and improved productivity. However, early adopters may encounter unexpected hurdles. </p>



<p>After spending time using the new CPU exclusively, let’s explore what this new chip offers, where it shines, and whether it’s the right upgrade for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-a-fresh-start-and-new-challenges">What’s New: A Fresh Start and New Challenges</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-naming-convention-and-socket-requirements">New Naming Convention and Socket Requirements</h3>



<p>The Core Ultra 9 285K introduces Intel’s new naming scheme, replacing the old “Core i” branding. This chip is comparable to the Core i9 series but brings more than just a new name. It’s built using TSMC’s manufacturing process, the same foundry behind AMD and Nvidia chips. </p>



<p>The Core Ultra 200S series also require the new LGA 1851 socket, meaning you’ll need a compatible motherboard to make the jump. And while Intel’s new approach looks to the future, the switch to the Core Ultra platform isn’t entirely seamless, especially for early adopters.</p>



<h3 id="h-pc-build-and-specifications">PC Build and Specifications</h3>



<p>Before getting into the actual review of the CPU, it’s important to note the hardware used for this review. The CPU is, as you’d expect, the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K. It’s sitting on an MSI MPG z890 Carbon WiFi motherboard with 48GB of G.Skill Trident Z5 CK CU-DIMM&nbsp;DDR5-8200 RAM and a Nvidia RTX 4090 FE graphics card.

<h2 id="h-installation-issues-a-frustrating-experience">Installation Issues: A Frustrating Experience</h2>



<p>Setting up the Core Ultra 9 285K proved more frustrating than it should have. After building the machine, I was faced with numerous boot issues that left the system stuck at the BIOS splash screen in a frustrating boot loop. The machine would work fine through the Windows 11 installation, but would then have issues arise after going through the initial setup.</p>



<p>It took reaching out directly to our motherboard manufacturer — in this case, MSI — to figure out the actual cause and a workaround.</p>



<p>From what I was told, there was an issue with Windows 11 and its  24H2 update. Specifically, it came down to connecting a discrete graphics card — something that almost everyone will do when building a PC — and trying to boot up. If you tried to use your AMD, Nvidia, or Intel GPU, you’re likely to run into this problem. Luckily, there’s a temporary fix.</p>



<h3 id="h-our-workaround">Our Workaround</h3>



<p>If you’re installing one of these new Intel Core Ultra CPUs with integrated graphics, follow these steps to avoid the headaches I encountered:</p>



<ol>
<li>Connect your monitor to the motherboard’s integrated graphics first.</li>



<li>Download and install all necessary drivers from the manufacturer’s website, as Windows updates won’t help just yet.</li>



<li>Turn off the PC, disconnect from the integrated graphics, and connect your discrete GPU.</li>



<li>Boot into Bios</li>



<li>Disable integrated graphics in the BIOS to avoid conflicts.</li>
</ol>



<p>These steps worked for me, but the process feels cumbersome, especially for anyone spending a premium on early adoption. I was told fixes are on the way, but for now, installation may be more frustrating than it’s worth.</p>



<h2 id="h-everyday-performance-quiet-cool-and-efficient">Everyday Performance: Quiet, Cool, and Efficient</h2>



<p>Once set up, the Core Ultra 9 285K impresses with its efficiency and thermal management. Power consumption remains low during everyday tasks, and temperatures stay well within safe limits.</p>



<ul>
<li>Average power usage during light tasks: 45 to 55 watts (W)</li>



<li>Maximum power during heavy benchmarking: 145W</li>



<li>Typical temperatures: between 43°C and 50°C</li>



<li>Peak temperature during stress tests: 87°C</li>
</ul>



<p>When looking back at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-i9-14900k-cpu-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Intel Core i9 14900K</a>, you can see just how big of a drop that is. The 14900K saw temperatures that maxed at 108°C and a max wattage of 304W when in the heaviest use. That saw drops of 52% in max power consumption and 19.4% in max temperature. And that comes with no change in the cooling or case being used from the last review.</p>



<p>This chip offers excellent stability for daily use, making it a great option for users who value quiet operation and energy efficiency.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-performance-a-step-to-the-side">Gaming Performance: A Step to the Side</h2>



<p>In gaming, the Core Ultra 9 285K offers performance comparable to Intel’s previous generations. While games run smoothly and look good, there’s no significant improvement over recent chips like the 13th or 14th-gen models.</p>



<ul>
<li>Games performed well without relying on upscaling technologies like DLSS or FSR.</li>



<li>Power and temperatures remained low during gaming sessions, even under extended play.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, gamers with recent hardware won’t see major gains by upgrading to the 285K. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 and F1 23 had solid performances, but nothing stood out after regular play time. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-productivity-performance-a-strong-contender">Productivity Performance: A Strong Contender</h2>



<p>For productivity tasks, the Core Ultra 9 285K shines. It handles video rendering and 3D modeling efficiently, with stable performance across various benchmarks.</p>



<ul>
<li>DaVinci Resolve rendering times:
<ul>
<li>1080p60: 1 minute 53 seconds</li>



<li>1440p60: 3 minutes 16 seconds</li>



<li>4K60: 6 minutes 9 seconds</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Blender rendering saw power usage peak at 132 watts, but most tasks kept it under 90 watts.</li>
</ul>



<p>This level of performance makes the 285K ideal for content creators who need reliable rendering power without excessive heat or energy consumption. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Benchmark</strong></th><th><strong>Results</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Blender</td><td>6:33 Render Time</td></tr><tr><td>7-Zip Compression</td><td>166,784 MIPS</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 Multi-Core</td><td>19930</td></tr><tr><td>Geekbench 6 Single-Core</td><td>2658</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Multi-Core</td><td>2282</td></tr><tr><td>Cinebench 2024 Single-Core</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>CPU Profile (3D Mark)</td><td>17,579</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-core-ultra-9-285k-worth-it">Is the Core Ultra 9 285K Worth It?</h2>



<p>The Core Ultra 9 285K brings meaningful improvements in efficiency, but it feels like the starting point for Intel’s next chapter rather than a revolutionary leap forward. Here’s our take on who should consider it and who might be better off waiting.</p>



<h3 id="h-who-should-buy-it">Who Should Buy It?</h3>



<ul>
<li>Users upgrading from older systems (5+ years) looking for better efficiency and future-proofing</li>



<li>Content creators and professionals focused on video editing, 3D rendering, or other CPU-heavy tasks</li>



<li>Energy-conscious users who prioritize quiet, efficient setups</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-who-should-wait">Who Should Wait?</h3>



<ul>
<li>Gamers with recent Intel or AMD hardware, as performance gains are minimal</li>



<li>Those interested in AMD’s upcoming Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which may offer better value</li>



<li>Budget-conscious upgraders waiting for 14th-gen Intel CPUs to drop in price</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts-a-glimpse-of-the-future-with-a-few-hiccups">Final Thoughts: A Glimpse of the Future with a Few Hiccups</h2>



<p>The Intel Core Ultra 9 285K is a solid introduction to Intel’s next era, offering improved efficiency and stable performance. However, the installation issues and lack of noticeable gaming gains make it hard to recommend to everyone.</p>



<p>If you’re overdue for an upgrade or need reliable productivity performance, the 285K could be a good choice. But for gamers or those already using recent hardware, it’s worth waiting for better stability, more driver support, and potential price drops. </p>



<p>This chip lays the foundation for Intel’s future, but it’s not yet the must-have upgrade many were hoping for. Early adopters should expect some challenges, but the long-term potential is promising.</p>

Activision quality assurance staff who worked on the just-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> have walked out in protest at the company's return-to-work policy.
</p>
<p>
Staff at Activision's quality assurance studio in Eden Prarie, Minnesota, were told to return to the office full-time back in January, after years of remote or hybrid working. At the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1851263877230612869">the move was criticised by the company's biggest union as a "soft layoff"</a>. Nine months later, the row over this policy's effects rumbles on. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday, Eden Prarie staff members took strike action backed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which claimed in a <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">statement</a> that Call of Duty publisher Activision was "insisting workers must work in the office - even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home". 
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the protest, Activision workers group ABetterABK issued a <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">statement</a> saying the "unequal policy" had "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accomodations", who it claims have been unfairly refused exception from return-to-office work in the months since the policy's introduction. 
</p><p>
So why strike now? Well, last Friday's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launch was an attention-grabbing date, for one. ABetterABK's statement also references employees being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing this October's National Disability Employment Awareness Month.
</p>
<p>
"[The email] depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," the statement claimed. "[Activison] has been championing DE&amp;I while they continually fail us."
</p>
<p>
Images of the protest show around 30 staff holding CWA signs. The walkout also attracted the attention of local media.

<p>
"We work on Call of Duty, we were part of the QA team that worked on Black Ops 6 that just released today," a striking staff member and ABetterABK union steward told Fox 9. 
</p>
<p>
"We have worked on Modern Warfare 2 which was the most profitable game the company ever released - and that was done remotely." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This afternoon, AQAU-CWA members held a rally protesting Activision and Microsoft's refusal to allow work from home accommodations to employees who need it.

<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer on the protest, an Activision spokesperson told me that the company acknowledged returning to offices had been "an adjustment for some" and that discussions over specific employee's needs were still "ongoing", the best part of a year since the policy was first announced.
</p><p>
"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," an Activision spokesperson told Eurogamer. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."

Oh sure, he knows his stuff, and his passion for archaeology and preserving stuff in museums is without doubt, but his impromptu field work probably means that he barely spends any time doing the <em>actual</em> teaching you’d expect him to. It should come as no surprise that, after a break-in at Marshall College by a very, very, very tall man, he takes that as an excuse to go gallivanting once again in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s address the priceless porcelain elephant in the room, because if there’s one element that has proven to be rather divisive since Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s reveal, it’s the mixed first and third-person views that MachineGames has leant upon for this game. Given how Indiana Jones helped inspire the third-person action of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, it would have been very natural for it to come full circle with third-person adventuring – after all, that’s what we saw in Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb, two decades ago – but that’s not MachineGames’ speciality, so they’ve gone predominantly first-person instead.</p>


<p>In fact, the game is probably 99% first person, with the only brief cuts to third-person coming when swinging on Indy’s trademark whip, pulling himself up to a ledge or a little bit of climbing. It works decently well, but I’d personally argue that they could ditch third-person entirely – we’ve had countless examples like Dishonored, Mirror’s Edge and more that have special abilities and slick movement entirely in first-person, and Indy’s just a dude who does a bit of clambering and swinging in comparison.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle quickly grabbed my attention as I played through the opening stages. There’s a really intriguing blend of linear and open levels, of action, stealth and puzzles, all wrapped up in the pulpy action adventuring of a classic Indiana Jones story.</p>

<p>Investigating the nighttime break-in at Marshall College is a quick prologue and introduction to the wider story, a familiar starting point as you and Marcus Brody try to figure out what was stolen and who did it. Crucial clues then see Indy immediately packing to head off to the Vatican –&nbsp;it’s alright, someone else can fill in for his classes.</p>

<p>Messaging a good friend in the clergy en route, it’s clear that this won’t be a haven of safety for an inquisitive American. Set shortly after Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1937, it’s the height of fascism in pre-WW2 Europe, and the Vatican is now flooded with patrolling Blackshirts that you have to sneak (or clobber) your way past.</p>
<p>You can absolutely use stealth to your advantage, hunkering down behind objects and out of sight, picking up objects and throwing them to cause distractions for you to move to other cover, but this isn’t Splinter Cell. Stealth is often more of a prelude to some robust and rambunctious brawling, without the ability to attach to cover or do corner takedowns, so you’ll invariably resort to fisticuffs at some point with left and right hooks, blocking incoming swings to let you counter, and grabbing items to wallop enemies with. Each item will break after just a few hits, whether it’s a rake or a bell that makes a delightful clanging sound as you clobber someone over the head –&nbsp;even more satisfying if it’s a canned takedown from behind.</p>
<p>One thing I didn’t really latch onto was using the whip for anything but traversal. In the moment, I was happier to wallop enemies instead, but that’s something I’ll have to remind myself to do for the full game.</p>

<p>You can, of course, resort to firearms as well, whether that’s Indy’s revolver or grabbing a dropped gun from an enemy. Don’t expect a Doom-like arsenal of guns to be stuffed into Indy’s back pocket, or even a Halo-style two-gun limit. This is more like the Mirror’s Edge of having just the clip that’s in a gun before you need to drop it – though you can also use empty rifles to hit people, which is a little amusing.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t tell you what you need to know about the gunplay, then the other thing is that a straight up headshot won’t kill an enemy, even if they’re not wearing a helmet. It took me by surprise while playing, but it makes sense. Two shots to kill at the default difficulty will encourage more of a stealthy approach and lead to more brawling.</p>
<p>You’re nicely rewarded for exploring the nooks and crannies of levels, with MachineGames having snuck a bunch of little side puzzles and secrets in. It makes you feel clever when you root around on a guy’s desk and find a note talking about some kind of iconoggraphy, only to spot that particular motif and realise that it’s the trigger for a secret passageway.</p>
<p>You’ll also be on the hunt for the books that feed the character progression. You need to then action those books by spending Adventure Points that you’ve collected for performing various feats and mission goals, mind you, but there’s some nifty abilities, such as Punch Out restoring stamina with a KO, Lucky Hat giving Indy another chance after being downed himself, if he can just drag himself across the floor to reach his fedora, and plenty more besides.</p>

<p>The trip through to the Vatican was a fairly directed and linear level, but jumping ahead to a visit to a dig site at Gizeh showed off the other side to this Indiana Jones game. This presents a much broader region to explore, with a workers’ camp that’s a safe haven to return to with Dame Nawal a handy ally to give you the main mission, a small village, and then a whole host of dig sites around the Sphinx.</p>
<p>It took a while to realise that the game wasn’t going to hold my hand here, shepherding me through to important events and mission objectives, wrapping me up in a disguise to get past German guards patrolling the desert. As I first stepped out of the camp, I was immediately confronted and found myself in a scrap, though a little more care meant I was more than able to avoid patrols. It’s only a fair bit later (and thanks to a set of handy pointers for this preview event) that I could grab and don some worker’s garb, from well away from the action –&nbsp;a little odd that I couldn’t get any at the camp or village, though.</p>
<p>The main goal is to figure out what Voss is after and foil his plan, with this adventure’s companion Gina manning a radio back in Dame Nawal’s tent. While waiting for the opportunity to sneak in, Nawal gives you the goal of preventing the wider pillaging of historical artifacts, namely a set to stone stelae that absolutely belong in a museum.</p>

<p>Following the clues to these locations takes you around this map, to underground passages and ancient structures. Some are single room puzzles –&nbsp;a room filled with angry scorpions needs you to waft a torch at them, another needs use of a lighter to clear a pitch black and completely overgrown passage –&nbsp;but then there are the much, much larger digs, a site that’s almost very flooded and with the Germans having to make do with too few pumps and generators. While they’re distracted, you can sneak in, get some clobbering done, a little bit of light electrocution by turning generators back on, and finally get access to a little puzzle chamber to reveal another stele.</p>
<p>There’s a nice flow to it, though I also found myself completely backed into a corner at one point, a half-loaded rifle in hand and half a dozen guards that I’d previously skirted past now heading down to figure out what the fuss was about. It took a few goes to get out of that scrappy situation, and it wasn’t a pretty fight!</p>

<p>Through it all, there’s a sense that MachineGames has really understood the charm and appeal of the Indiana Jones films. The cutscenes are impeccably rendered, Troy Baker doing a good job of channelling a younger Harrison Ford (though still occasionally sounding more like himself), and with some light humour that largely works quite well.</p>
<p>I do think that the first person gameplay will remain a sticking point for some. There’s a different style and scale to how you interact with a game world in first person over third person, a need for greater precision in your controls when trying to target and interact with things, and a closeness that perhaps highlights the game-y way that characters walk, talk and act outside of cutscenes, but I’m fine with that. The films are pulpy fun, so this can be a game-y game.</p>
<p>And in general, I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!</p>
