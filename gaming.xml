			<p>In a special developer live stream today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-still-in-pre-production-bioware-passes-star-wars-the-old-republic-new-dev/">Star Wars: The Old Republic team</a> announced the next major update that will be arriving to the MMORPG, with the update being titled Game Update 7.6 - Galactic Threads. This is set to be a relatively significant update, as a lot of new features and content will be added, as well as character art modernization. The update will begin to roll out in December to players across the globe, with the story missions arriving in Star Wars: The Old Republic in 2025.</p>
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic was first released in 2011, and since then has evolved a fair amount, with there being plenty of content for Star Wars fans to get stuck into. One of the most important features being added in the Galactic Threads update is the modernization of the character and planet art. This is something that has been in the works for a while, but updating all of the models and planets is very time consuming. While the updates on modernizing the graphics are slow, players will be able to see texture changes to models such as the Human, Chiss, Cyborg, and Miralukan, bringing improved fidelity to the game. To showcase the changes that have been made, the SWTOR team has released a YouTube video that shows off the graphical updates they have been working on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet and Character Model Modernization coming to Game Update 7.6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WN7JD4pTpks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, there is a ton more coming to the game aside from just this update. This includes new story missions that carry on straight from the Desperate Defiance storyline. Of course, these missions won't be rolled out until 2025, but players will at least be given time to get excited about them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the update will add a new boss fight called The Propagator Core XR-53, a new lair boss that will launch in Story and Veteran difficulties. Alongside this, there will be brand-new Dynamic Encounters, world content dedicated to immersing players in the exploration of the worlds they inhabit. The Dynamic Encounters will vary, depending on where you are and what you are doing. This could include having to take out Hidden Chain forces or herding together Banthas, who escaped. If you want to get stuck in, these encounters will first be arriving on Hoth and Tatooine, offering a bounty of rewards for players to earn.</p>
<p>If you want to know every last detail about what you can expect about the upcoming update to Star Wars: The Old Republic, <a href="https://www.swtor.com/info/news/article/20241114-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a> has all of the info about what you can expect and some of the smaller features being added to the MMORPG.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamemaker-25th-anniversary-celebrations-include-free-steam-game.1036836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamemaker-25th-anniversary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Game creation engine GameMaker is 25 years old today, and to celebrate, the software suite's developers have released a free game that you can play on Steam right now.</p>

<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>is a management sim in which you must manage the development house creating GameMaker. Whoa, recursive.</p>

<p>You'll have to keep your employees happy, choose which features to add to your game creation engine, and upgrade your office in order to keep worker productivity at a maximum. Along the way, you'll also collect "posters based on the history of GameMaker".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamemaker-25th-anniversary-free-game-release.jpg?itok=H1djkgP1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamemaker-25th-anniversary-free-game-release.jpg?itok=yitBjc2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>asks how you would do managing your very own game creation suite.</figcaption></figure><p>Creator YoYo Games (which is, believe it or not, also the company responsible for making GameMaker) describes&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>as a "minigame-filled, top-down management and strategy game".</p>

<p>The game has a lot in common with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-dev-story-other-kairosoft-games-now-on-steam" rel="nofollow">Game Dev Story</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>, although this one's based more around creating creation software itself rather than the games made with said software.</p>

<p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>was also made in GameMaker, and YoYo Games says it intends to make the source code assets and project files free to GameMaker users soon in the form of a template for the software kit.</p>

<p>It's all part of celebrating GameMaker's 25th year on our storied planet. You can read a blog post detailing what else YoYo has in the pipeline for GameMaker as part of these anniversary celebrations <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gamemaker-25" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here if you're interested</a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what GameMaker is, it's a game creation toolkit that specializes in creating 2D games across all current major platforms.</p>

<p>Some of the games that have been made using GameMaker include all-time classic&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/undertale" rel="nofollow"><em>Undertale</em></a>, cozy farming sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fields-of-mistria" rel="nofollow"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>, and ultra-violent arcade action game&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami</em>, to name but a few.</p>

<p>GameMaker is free to use on a non-commercial basis; the transition from paid to free was made last year, at which point YoYo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamemaker-free-non-commercial-use" rel="nofollow">also seemingly took a swipe at Unity</a>, which was, at the time, going through a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" rel="nofollow">major controversy surrounding a runtime fee</a> for developers.</p>

<p>You can download GameMaker and get started with it via the tool's <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.&nbsp;<em>GameMaker 25th Anniversary&nbsp;</em>is currently available to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219220/GameMaker_25th_Anniversary/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

While not shocking, the reassurance comes after this fall’s big holiday Xbox console exclusive, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></span>, announced a PS5 port coming just a few months later in the spring. The multiplatform push has had some fans  doubting the platform’s future, especially when Spencer says things like there’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-boss-spencer-halo-ps5-switch-exclusive-no-red-line-1851697549">no red line</a></span>” when it comes to bringing first-party games to rival consoles, including the next <em>Halo</em>. </p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously teased</a></span> that Microsoft’s next Xbox would be the “largest technical leap” players have ever seen in a console generation. And this week Spencer confirmed that the company is working on a dedicated PC gaming handheld, though it’s still a few years off. Previous leaks pegged a new Xbox console coming in late 2026, and while plans can always change, it certainly sounds like Microsoft remains all-in on hardware for the next 5-10 years, even if the success of those devices isn’t ultimately propelled first and foremost by exclusive franchises like <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>and <em>Gears of War</em>.</p><p>And what of Microsoft skipping the mid-cycle refresh? Unlike last time when its Xbox Series X and the PS4 Pro went head-to-head, Sony’s spiffed-up, $700 gaming rig has launched uncontested this year. Spencer’s answer is that the improvements just don’t warrant an incremental update this time around. “We think about hardware that can create unique value for our players or creators on our platform,” he told <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “We don’t need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit.”</p><p>He continued, “Does a new device really give you a unique experience onscreen in some way? [It’s] less like the old days, going from the original Xbox to 360; that was standard definition to high definition. Now, [it’s] harder to show the benefits.” That echoed a comment he made to <em>Bloomberg</em> this week as well about reaching new audiences. “We’re not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles,” Spencer said. </p><p>Those implied shots at the PS5 Pro come after months of debate about whether Sony’s second-most-expensive console ever seems worth it for slightly better resolutions at higher framerates. While experts and diehard enthusiasts are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">singing the praises</a></span> of the device for improving games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-on-ps5-pro-delivers-huge-image-quality-improvements-at-60fps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a></span>, others have noted that even being a little too far away from the screen or dealing with daytime glare from windows all but cancels out that upgrade. </p><p>Of course, if Sony is struggling to showcase meaningful improvements with new hardware that’s $300 more than the all-digital PS5 was at launch, how exactly are we going to get the “largest technical leap you’ve ever seen” out of the next Xbox at an affordable price? Maybe machine learning, generative AI, and cloud computing, which Microsoft is currently all-in on, will provide a unique solution to that dilemma. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Blizzard is hiring for an unannounced upcoming open-world shooter game. A job ad posted on November 13 revealed this, though the requisition doesn't have too many details about what the game is.</p><p>The<a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> job ad for the Associate Design Director, Innovation</a> says this person will be the "vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations" for the upcoming unannounced "open-world shooter game."</p><p>The job calls for someone to help implement strategies that have "shown potential but have not yet permeated the AAA space." The successful candidate will work with Blizzard's engineering, art, and audio teams to help guide the project from concept to release. This wording specifically suggests whatever this game is, it might be early in development.</p><p>According to the job listing (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-starcraft-reports-blizzard-is-hiring-for-an-open-world-shooter-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), a successful candidate can expect to earn a minimum annual salary of $124,400, with the potential of reaching $230,300.</p><p>This job ad was only posted this week, but journalist Jason Schreier's new book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment, contained a passage mentioning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-trying-to-make-a-starcraft-shooter-again/1100-6526763/" data-ref-id="1100-6526763">a StarCraft shooter is, or was, in development at Blizzard</a>.

		<p>It’s been slower going than I’d hoped with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro’s</a> enhanced lineup of games, as I wrangle together all the video clips and comparison points I need. I’m close to completing our Insomniac games round-up though, and I’m convinced that they’re the single best development studio out there this generation. Who else has managed to deliver three games in four years, pushing the boundaries for console graphics and world building each time, and reliably returned to previous releases to keep on delivering new tech options? They’re at it again with PS5 Pro, and long may it continue!</p>

<p>We’ll start off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who turned in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">review of Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which wasn’t quite on the level of TT Games’ series, but certainly looks absolutely gorgeous. He’s joined that up with more Metaphor: Refantazio, and he’s been on a trip to play a mystery game. More on that soonish?</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent this week playing the curiously titled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/max-mustard-review/">Max Mustard</a> on PSVR 2, which is surprisingly not a game about a hotdog stall that’s run out of ketchup. He’s also played Phasmophobia with his sister, and found that he really likes it now that he’s figured out more about how it works.</p>


<p>It’s been most Black Ops 6 for <strong>Jim</strong>, now that Season One is live, and he’s still having a great time with it. He’s also returned to New World: Aeternum and is approaching the endgame and PvP content that waits after level 60 &nbsp;– “It’s the most fun I’ve had playing a console MMO since Final Fantasy XIV and it’s good to see just how populated the world is, even if it means getting my ass handed to me in PvP zones.”</p>
<p>3D Don’t Die Mr Robot is, according to <strong>Aran</strong>, exactly what it sounds like. “It is a 3D revision of the original Don’t Die Mr Robot, and my full review should be out next week.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Steve</strong> has also played some 3D Don’t Die Mr Robot, as well as an early build of Soulframe (from the makers of Warframe), Steve reviewed “the effortlessly cool and sexy <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/sorry-were-closed-review/">Sorry, We’re Closed</a>, a game that takes the bones of a survival horror and reinvigorates them into something that feels fresh.”</p>

<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> apologised for playing Destiny 2, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> real world gaming adventure of Moving House went very well, but he now has the&nbsp;unpacking, painting, and sorting DLC to do. Maybe not quite in that order.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed PC Specs Revealed Ahead of February Release]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-pc-specs-revealed-ahead-of-february-release.1036809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian and Xbox have quietly revealed the&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>PC specs you'll need to run the upcoming first-person RPG, and they're relatively permissive, although it's likely you'll want a good rig to get the best out of this one.</p>

<p>The specs appeared yesterday on the game's Steam page without much fanfare from Obsidian itself, and since they're listed on Steam, you're only getting two presets: Minimum and Recommended, as is Steam's custom.</p>

<p>The minimum specs are pretty basic, but it's likely that you won't get much more than 30fps or so at 1080p resolution if you're running a rig with the minimum settings. Recommended users can likely expect a smoother experience, as usual.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-pc-specs-bear.jpg?itok=OB38gN88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-pc-specs-bear.jpg?itok=UgWldcl9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will need a decent PC to run it at Recommended specs.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>'s spec presets on Steam will need 16GB of RAM, Windows 10 or 11 with updates installed, and at least 75GB of file space, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-300gb" rel="nofollow">pretty reasonable</a> by modern game standards. You'll also want to install DirectX 12.</p>

<p>The game's Minimum settings will require either an Intel Core i5-8400 or an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. You'll also need an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, an AMD Radeon RX 5700, or an Intel Arc A580.</p>

<p>Moving up to Recommended, you'll need an Intel Core i7-10700K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X processor, as well as an Nvidia RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT card.</p>

<p>It's not clear what exactly those specs will get you; we don't have one of those tables developers sometimes release that show what kind of resolution and frame rate you can expect with each preset, so try to clear the Recommended settings by some distance if you want the smoothest experience.</p>

<p>Hopefully, it'll be better than the Xbox Series X|S version, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-30fps-xbox-target" rel="nofollow">running at 30fps</a>. Console players can't simply upgrade their machines to help them run the game more smoothly, either.</p>




<p>These specs were revealed alongside&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>'s Premium Edition, which grants two skin packs, access to a digital artbook and soundtrack, and "up to 5 days early access". Let's hope it goes better than&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-early-access-bug" rel="nofollow"><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s early access period did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, it's a first-person RPG created by Obsidian, the makers of&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>. Appropriately enough, the game looks to be a mixture of those games, with the fantasy setting of the former (the very same one, in fact) and the first-person gameplay of the latter, albeit without guns.</p>

<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/avowed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 18th, although you can play it early if you pre-order the Premium Edition. The game is also launching on day one across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">certain Game Pass tiers</a>.</p>

Before that, you’ve got the critically demolished <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em>, preceded by Uwe Boll’s monstrously dreadful <em>Far Cry</em> in 2008. (To be fair, <em>Prince of Persia</em> at least squeaked a profit, albeit not enough to prevent planned sequels getting cancelled.) Scattered amongst them are many promised projects that never quite seem to reach our eyes.<br></p><p>One of those is now known  to be <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-movie-is-happening-tom-hardy-starring-as-5960678">was first confirmed as in development in 2012</a></span>. Set to star Tom Hardy (<em>Mad Max</em>) as ultra-spy Sam Fisher, be written by Eric Warren Singer (<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), and later attached to director Doug Liman (<em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>), it was announced at the same time as the Michael Fassbender-starring <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, although only one of them ever made it to screen. The wrong one? We shall never know.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>The Direct</em></a></span>, producer Basil Iwanyk—while on some <em>John Wick</em>-related promotion—said that the movie is “now dead.”</p><p>“That movie would have been awesome,” the <em>Expendables </em>producer told the site. “Just couldn’t get it right, script-wise, budget-wise. But it was going to be great.” Mmm-hmm.</p><p>Admittedly, Clancy’s <em>Splinter Cell</em> conceit of a black-ops agent doing generic spy stuff should have been a fairly easy lift, it didn’t necessarily <em>have</em> to be dreadful. But in a producer’s imagination, it could have been perfection. “It was going to be hardcore and awesome,” he continued.</p><h2 id="h67321"><a id=""></a>Intellectual Propagation</h2><p>Ubisoft has, in fact, created a whole division devoted to the process of converting its IPs to non-interactive screens, called Ubisoft Film &amp; Television.

<p>Grove Street Games’ lead has addressed the removal of their name from the credits of the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition. Fans pointed out that it was only partially removed.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/boss-of-developer-behind-gta-trilogys-original-poorly-received-launch-laments-being-removed-from-games-credits-even-though-he-wasnt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Thomas Williamson, the head of Grove Street Games, recently <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">addressed</a> the removal of his company from the credits of the GTA Trilogy following the latest update. You can find his complete statement below.:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Speaking entire hypothetically: It’s a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players’ hands for years.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1857196839713263958" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Several fans responded</a> to Williamson’s post, highlighting that Grove Street Games has not been entirely removed from the GTA Trilogy’s credits. They mentioned that the developers are still credited in the final credits but have been removed from the initial splash screen.</p>



<p>Recently, the GTA Trilogy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-receives-major-update-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a significant update for both PC and consoles</a>, introducing new game features and enhancements. Key highlights of this update include a new “Classic Lighting” mode and improved animations, which greatly enhance the visual quality of the games. <span>This update removed Grove Street Games from GTA Trilogy’s </span>opening credits. </p>

It’s available for the Assault, Vanguard, and Bulwark classes and is limited to Operations, Space Marine 2’s three-player co-op focused PvE mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s there that Space Marine 2 players are teaming up to form a three-pronged Neo-Volkite pistol death stream, rekindling memories of all those moments when the Ghostbusters use their iconic Proton Packs to trap ghosts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Neo-Volkite pistol is unique among Space Marine 2’s armory in that it blasts a heat ray onto enemies, dealing accumulative thermal damage. Focusing on one enemy ramps up the damage until it generates a localized explosion for huge damage to your target and all nearby enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have found that while the Neo-Volkite pistol is fun to use, it isn’t that effective especially on harder difficulties where ammo is scarce. At least, that’s the case in isolation. But what happens when all three players use the Neo-Volkite pistol to concentrate three heat rays onto the pesky Terminids? You get satisfying, Ghostbusters-style alien death, that’s what.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Crimsas demonstrated this in action, showing just how effective three Neo-Volkite pistols all trained on a single, powerful Termanid enemy (in this case a Carnifex) can be brought down to size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All we now need is a mod that replaces the Neo-Volkite pistol model with an actual Proton Pack and we’ve got Ghostbusters 40k edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/109-patch-4-5-is-available" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Focus Entertainment has said</u></a> it’s limiting the Neo-Volkite pistol to Operations mode for now “as we continue to experiment with balancing in PvP.” It will be added to Eternal War mode in Space Marine 2’s next major update alongside a new Operations map, a new enemy, and the Dark Angels cosmetics. So, hopefully it won’t be long before even PvP is filled with a spot of Ghostbusters action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1grt0ik/neovolkite_my_beloved/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Crimsas / reddit</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The patch added a number of visual features that were exclusive to the mobile versions, pleasing disgruntled fans of the groundbreaking open-world games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, a compilation of 2001’s Grand Theft Auto 3, 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and 2004’s Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, sparked a backlash upon its 2021 launch on PC and console. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review"><u>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition review</u></a> returned a 5/10. We said: “GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is defective, disappointing, and surprisingly disrespectful to three classic games and their many legions of fans.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition was developed by Grove Street Games, which at the time came under fire for the poor quality of the release. The mobile versions were developed by Video Games Deluxe, the Australian studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/la-noire-the-vr-case-files"><u>L.A. Noire VR Case Files</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After this week’s update went live, users noticed Grove Street Games and its logo were removed from GTA Trilogy’s main menu and splash screen.

<p>Phil Spencer recently discussed the reasons for not releasing a mid-gen refresh console for Xbox Series X/S like the PS5 Pro, stating it’s “harder to show the benefits” for such consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, Phil Spencer was asked why Xbox wasn’t working on a mid-gen refresh like the PS5 Pro. In response, Spencer stated that Xbox thinks “about hardware that can create unique value” for the players or creators on its platform. The company doesn’t need to work on “incremental hardware” for its benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phil Spencer asked whether a new mid-gen device provides players with “a unique experience on screen in some way”. He stated that “it’s less like the old days” when going from the original Xbox to 360 meant moving from “standard definition to high definition”.” He concluded by stating, “Now, it’s harder to show the benefits” for mid-gen consoles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same interview, Spencer also confirmed that Xbox would “definitely do more consoles in the future, and other devices”. Spencer means the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-handheld-confirmed-phil-spencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Handheld</a> by “other devices”, which was confirmed during another interview a few days ago. However, this console will not arrive for a few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Phil Spencer has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed wasn’t delayed due to game quality</a>. Also, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-stalker-2-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether Stalker 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>.

			<p>Spanish developer HEXWORKS was one of the first developers to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share</a> information on the graphics enhancements they had planned for their game's PS5 Pro version. As you might recall, HEXWORKS was founded in early 2020 specifically to make Lords of the Fallen, and they've got big plans for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> tentatively slated for 2026. In the meantime, though, they're continuing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> this game with patches and with the introduction of PS5 Pro support.</p>
<p>To delve into greater detail about their experience with Sony's new console, we interviewed Eduard Gonzalez, Principal Engine Programmer at HEXWORKS. Gonzalez lavished praise on the PS5 Pro hardware and revealed that this version actually runs on the highest PC settings available (though, of course, you can run Lords of the Fallen at higher frame rates on PC, provided you've got the significantly more expensive hardware to do it). Still, it's a major accomplishment that not many games achieve, and they did it without even using Sony's much-vaunted AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - PS5 Pro 4K 60FPS Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtJD57wMtk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 has been known to have spotty performance on PS5 (and Xbox Series S|X). Is the PS5 Pro a significant improvement in that regard?</strong></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5 has empowered developers to increase triangle density in games by an order of magnitude. Achieving smooth framerates with this level of visual detail required several iterations of both the engine and content, but we’ve now reached a point where we can deliver a vastly enhanced experience showcasing the visual power of UE5. With this foundation, the PS5 Pro hardware upgrade marks a significant step forward. It enables further improvements to object visibility, texture density, and overall resolution, all while boosting framerates. The PS5 was solid, but the Pro is truly exceptional hardware.</p>
<p><strong>What is the single feature you were most impressed with after getting your hands on the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro enhances the PS5 base model in every aspect: a faster GPU, quicker CPU, upgraded raytracing units, additional memory, and custom machine learning hardware. If we had to highlight a single standout feature, it would be the GPU, which belongs to a hardware generation beyond the original.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>While the advancement is somewhat comparable, the PS5 Pro makes a more significant leap, especially with the introduction of custom machine learning hardware. This addition unlocks a whole new realm of possibilities for visual and performance enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of Lords of the Fallen?</strong></p>
<p>The improvement is noticeable, with a 40% increase in the game’s native rendering resolution. This enhancement makes a significant difference, especially on 4K screens, where details are far more visible, truly letting high-end TVs shine. In the PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen, Performance Mode provides rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, as well as sharper distant details and refined textures on characters and environments. For those playing in Quality Mode, this runs at a native 4K30, allowing up to showcase intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to established upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>PSSR is an impressive technology, offering quality comparable to DLSS and Unreal Engine 5’s built-in upscaling, with the added benefit of being embedded directly in the console, making it compatible with any engine: PSSR is undeniably a valuable addition. After extensive testing, we found no visual differences compared to our custom version of UE5's upscaling, which is also highly robust. Therefore, we decided to continue using our own upscaling method.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The game indeed utilizes the highest graphics settings available on PC. As I touched upon earlier, players can select between two graphics modes: Performance Mode and Quality Mode. Performance Mode is optimized for a smooth experience, while Quality Mode focuses on delivering the sharpest visuals. The primary distinction between these modes is the native rendering resolution, which dynamically adjusts to meet target frame rates - 60 FPS for Performance Mode and 30 FPS for Quality Mode. In short, you’ll enjoy top-tier PC graphics on the PS5 Pro, but you’ll need to choose between native 4K at 30 FPS or upscaled 4K at 60 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-gives-subtle-dig-at-ps5-pro-price-were-not-growing-the-market-with-1000-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy</a> about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, is it fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>Building a PC with comparable components - GPU, CPU, memory, and SSD - at a similar quality level would be significantly more costly, so it’s great to see Sony is bringing this high-end hardware to a wider audience. Rest assured, our game runs great on the standard PS5, so if the PS5 Pro is out of budget you will still enjoy Lords of the Fallen, but if you do have that extra budget, the PS5 Pro truly elevates the experience!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anti-defamation-league-says-steam-rife-with-extremism-and-antisemitism.1036737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/anti-defamation-league-steam-extremism-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Anti-Defamation League has released a new report which claims that digital distribution platform Steam is "rife with extremism and antisemitism", with the report also claiming it's identified "millions of examples" of content reflecting this problem.</p>

<p>According to the ADL, the report analyzed over 450 million Steam profiles, as well as more than 152 million "profile and group avatar images" and over 610 million comments on Steam user profiles and group pages.</p>

<p>Among the "millions of examples" of extremist content uncovered by the report were "explicit hate symbols" like the happy merchant figure and the sonnenrad, as well as "copypastas shaped into swastikas". We won't be showing any kind of images illustrating the ADL's points here, but you can imagine the kinds of things the report found.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=EMHjKk6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=rg51TLN6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Anti-Defamation League says Steam is "rife" with extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>In numbers terms, the ADL says it identified 1.83 million "unique pieces of extremist or hateful content", as well as 1.5 million users and over 73,000 groups "who used at least one potentially extremist or hateful symbol, copypasta, or keyword" on Steam.</p>

<p>1.18 million unique instances of extremist copypastas were identified, as well as over 820,000 avatars for users and groups containing extremist symbols. Additionally, the report found "thousands of profiles" glorifying violent extremists such as "white supremacist mass shooters".</p>

<p>The ADL blames Valve's "highly permissive approach to content policy" for this issue, stating that while Steam does occasionally remove high-profile extremist content, it has failed to "systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform".</p>

<p>One such example of Valve banning extremist content on Steam was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">removal of gladiator game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">Domina</a>&nbsp;</em>following a transphobic rant on the part of its developer, but the ADL seems to be suggesting that this kind of action is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=n5mxcVLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=25U7Qwio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>According to the ADL, many Steam profiles contain hateful or extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what does the ADL recommend Valve and Steam do about extremist and hateful content on the platform?</p>

<p>First, the ADL says Valve should adopt specific policies to prohibit extremism. There's currently no policy on Steam that specifically outlaws this kind of content, so the ADL wants to see one implemented.</p>

<p>Other recommendations include adopting policies "prohibiting hate", as well as enforcing policies "accurately at scale" and closing adult content moderation loopholes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ADL says Valve should "engage with civil society, academics, and researchers" in order to shape its policies and prevent "vulnerable and marginalized groups" from being targeted on Steam.</p>

<p>You can read the ADL's full report, which contains numerous examples of the kind of content discovered on Steam during the course of the report's undertaking, <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

Of those three titles, Towerborne will eventually make it to Xbox Series X|S, but don't get used to having Microsoft games skipping consoles. The company's gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, has indicated that this was "an anomaly" that's unlikely to be repeated.</p><p>"This is historical," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game FIle</a>. "There might always be some anomalies, but I look at those three as an anomaly. We want our games playable across as many screens as possible. We think about the Xbox platform as the Xbox console, PC, and cloud. We want all the games playable across all of those. We want them to be Play Anywhere."</p><p>While there don't appear to be any plans to bring World of Warcraft to Xbox consoles, Spencer has been bullish about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-comments-on-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation/1100-6522971/" data-ref-id="1100-6522971">sharing select Microsoft-owned titles with Sony's PlayStation</a>.

Spencer also mentioned his larger goal of allowing players to own a title regardless of where they're playing it.</p><p>"We want to get to the point where, when you buy, whether you're buying on cloud--which we're getting ready to introduce--buying on PC and buying on console, you own it across all of the Xbox ecosystem," said Spencer.</p>

                <p>The video game console market "isn't growing," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a new interview, and that's part of the reason why you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">don't need an Xbox to play Xbox these days. </a></p><p>"The console space all up isn't growing, across all of them [Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo]. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places," Spencer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Just because the console market isn't growing, that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning consoles. Spencer said Microsoft will "definitely do more consoles in the future," as well as "other devices."</p><p>None of this is a surprise, as Microsoft has already confirmed a next-gen Xbox that promises the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history</a>. As for the "other devices," Spencer may be referring to the Xbox handheld device that is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/" data-ref-id="1100-6527758">"few years out."</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer reiterated that Microsoft is probably not planning a mid-gen Xbox refresh, like Sony did with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>. He said, "We don't need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way?"</p><p>Years ago, the leap between the original Xbox and Xbox 360 was significant in terms of graphics and performance, Spencer said, but these days "it's harder to show the benefits" of more powerful hardware alone.</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This Is An Xbox" ad campaign</a> reminds people that Xbox is no longer limited to being a piece of plastic under your TV. Your phone is an Xbox, as is your TV, and any number of other devices, because Xbox games--and Game Pass--are available in those places. Spencer said he understands some part of the Xbox audience enjoys the "simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game." But the reality is that, "Today's largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms."</p><p>He said the Xbox platform should be about games, characters, and worlds, as opposed to any one dedicated device. "That's how we think about Xbox today," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Leaked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> images have surfaced that appear to show a selection of free battle pass rewards for Ubisoft's upcoming blockbuster. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and Ubisoft is yet to announce any details officially on how this will work. 
</p>
<p>
Still, datamined content appears to suggest players will be able to complete daily missions from within the game's new Animus Hub to progress a battle pass with 20 free tiers and receive cosmetic items. Ubisoft now appears to be scrubbing images from social media, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grbg48/information_and_assets_of_the_upcoming_animus_hub/">reddit</a>.

<p>
Cosmetic items include the kind of optional visual items Assassin's Creed has regularly offered for free and for sale in the past, including character costumes, weapon skins and new looks for your mount. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has long hosted daily and weekly missions, too. As with most Ubisoft games, these timed challenges and rewards are found within the publisher's Ubisoft Connect app.
</p>
<p>
Shadows looks set to streamline all of this within its Animus Hub, the new and still rather nebulous home of the series' modern day story that will also act as connective tissue between future Assassin's Creed games. 
</p>
<p>Leaked artwork looks to show Shadows' co-protagonist Yasuke standing within the Animus Hub, suggesting players will be able to use character avatars to navigate it.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">Animus Hub project, also known in development as Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, back in 2022 with franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté. "It's going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise into the future," he said at the time. 
</p><p>At a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London earlier this month, Coté went into more detail on how the series will handle its modern day narrative in future, after admitting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">it had been a "struggle" to remain consistent since the departure of the series' initial protagonist Desmond</a>. </p>
<p>"Our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise.</p>
<p>"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history.</p>
<p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."</p>
<p>For more from Coté, you can read Eurogamer's reports on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">how the Assassin's Creed boss addressed Assassin's Creed Shadows' creative backlash</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">Ubisoft's decision to delay Shadows and restore confidence in its ability to launch quality games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Per <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a report by movie publication The Direct</a>, producer Basil Iwanyk says the movie is no longer happening. He says the creative forces behind the film "just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise", but that it "would have been awesome".</p>

<p>Iwanyk goes on to call the&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie "one of the ones that got away, which is really sad". Given that we hadn't heard anything from the film for a number of years, it's perhaps not surprising that it's been canned, but it's a shame nonetheless.</p>

<p>Officially titled&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, the show will star Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher, with original voice actor Michael Ironside claiming there's "no way" he should still be playing Fisher given his advanced age. I'm sure a legion of&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans would disagree, but there we are.</p>

<p>While the animated series is sure to make&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans happy, there's still no new&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>game on the horizon. The last release in the franchise was 2013's&nbsp;<em>Blacklist</em>, and since then, appropriately enough, Fisher has gone dark.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced a remake</a> of the original&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>, but since then, news on the project has been scarce. Given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">recent track record with remakes</a>, however, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised about that.</p>




<p>On the whole, it must be said that&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>IP owner Ubisoft isn't having the best year of it.</p>

<p>Between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">investor threats</a>, employees taking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">strike action</a>, and major breadwinners <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">being delayed</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">dramatic drop in earnings</a>, now might well be the time for Fisher to return from retirement and attempt to save his ailing parent company.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developer Respawn is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service.</p>
<p>Whilst not formally announced, a recent survey sent out to Apex Legends fans asked if they would be interested in a "monthly subscription" to unlock in-game rewards for the free-to-play battle royale.</p>

<p>The questions suggest Respawn is considering a subscription similar to Epic Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-gbp10-monthly-subscription-in-december">Fortnite Crew</a>. Much like Apex Legends' recent survey, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-mulls-monthly-paid-subscription">some Fortnite fans were initially polled on a potential subscription model</a>, and a short while after, a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-gbp10-monthly-subscription-in-december"> £10 subscription was indeed launched</a>.</p><p>Although we have no details as yet, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-monthly-subscription/">Insider Gaming</a>, which has seen the survey, suggests the subscription would include in-game currency, monthly rewards, and battle pass tiers. By comparison, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew subscription includes access to the game's current Battle Pass (typically £8 every three months or so), an exclusive cosmetics pack, and a 1000 V-Bucks (£6.49/$8) stipend.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-nostalgia-is-this-year%E2%80%99s-most-popular-game-mode.1036677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/why-nostalgia-is-this-years-most-popular-game-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sit back in your favourite armchair, brush down that dusty controller, and put on your glasses – no, not the ones for far away, the ones for reading – while I tell you a story about the days of yore. In my time, and probably your time, games came out that were ground-breaking, earth-shattering and occasionally even fun. Lots of people bought and played those games, and they became cemented in our psyches, like a good book, or that random interaction with a stranger seven years ago where you said “Hurgle” instead of “Hello”.</p>
<p>Seemingly, those games are better than the ones we’ve been given subsequently, and so we’ve been inundated with remasters and remakes over the past decade and a bit… but now even live service games are getting in on the action, making Sony’s trend of remaking PS4 games look like they’re unearthing great lost wonders of the world. Can you really pine for the good old days, when those are barely 5 years ago?</p>



<p>And yet, we do. In the past month alone, the nostalgia levels have hit an all time high. On the one hand you have Blizzard weighing up whether or not to undo the format changes of Overwatch 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/">bringing back test modes with the original 6v6 battles</a> – <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic">aptly branded as Overwatch Classic</a> – that made it an instant hit, and cemented it as the multiplayer shooter to beat. Given that everyone has argued that its shift to 5v5 ruined the game – “In my day sonny, we could have <em>two</em> tanks” – it’s strange that it’s taken this long, but Blizzard are never one for doing things quickly. Even when they make mistakes in a hurry, they’ll take their time to fix things.</p>
<p>But multiplayer gaming like it’s 2016 would feels like Ye Olden Days when compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Here are two of the biggest multiplayer shooters in the world, and they’re rolling us <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691">right back to the original maps</a>, trying to recapture the point in time when they were at the cutting edge. It’s almost like they’re admitting that years of development, patches and updates have resulted in a creative cul-de-sac, where you’re faced with an array of familiar looking battle passes, meta tweaks, and over-the-top cosmetics.</p>

<p>Is this the result of creative bankruptcy? It’s been over half a decade since their respective launches, when they burst into the public consciousness, riding the wave of new and groundbreaking development, and it takes a lot to cling onto someone’s attention for that long. The fourth or fifth time that you blow up the map and launch a new one isn’t quite as exciting as the first.</p>

<p>These games are on very different paths, though. Blizzard and Respawn both seem to be trying to find or reimagine that original magic, but while in Overwatch 2’s case that’s potentially reverting its core, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/apex-legends-new-launch-royale-mode-rewinds-back-to-2019/">Apex Legends’ Launch Royale is a limited time mode</a>, while the game as a whole looks to push forward. EA aren’t looking for Apex 2.0, but ways to keep players hooked with things like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/ea-backtracks-on-some-apex-legends-season-22-battle-pass-changes/">the mid-season battle pass cuts</a>. Fortnite, meanwhile, has grown into something else entirely. It now supports user generated content, plays host to a whole LEGO experience, Fall Guys and a Rocket League racing mode, and regular live music events. Bringing back the original battle royale map, reviving the earlier battle passes and unlocks is sure to rekindle FOMO in anyone that missed out first time around, but it’s also kind of just another mode.</p>
<p>But while their goals are all somewhat different, they’ve all ended up at the same place: nostalgia.&nbsp;People loved all of these games in the beginning, so why not bring elements of them back? Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, a keen draw, and as we enter a time where older players have been gaming their entire lives, there’s a lot to draw on. Further to that, those older players are the ones with money. I can afford a good few Overwatch skins as an adult, while my children have to weigh up whether that’s a useful way to spend their pocket money. That’s a hard choice when Kinder Eggs exist.</p>
<p>Arguably, there are also players out there who won’t have experienced these things. For whom 2016, 2018 and 2019 was actually the distant past – especially given how 2020-21 felt like a decade. Will they find out that things were better? Or will they miss the changes, miss<em> their</em> version of the game? In some ways it’s a dangerous road to travel, appeasing part of the community while annoying another.</p>

<p>What is certain is that this era of nostalgia in gaming isn’t going to disappear. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, a game that’s never released its grip on the MMO genre it dominated from the moment it launched, is another one looking to the past in order to secure its future. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/06/world-of-warcraft-classic-review/">WoW Classic now five years old</a> and with its impending shift into becoming Kung Fu Panda the MMO again, Blizzard launching new servers to WoW Classic to let players start from the very beginning all over again – WoW Classic Classic, if you will.</p>
<p>So who’s next on the nostalgia list? Are we going to see Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Un-Reborn?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> roll back to a pre-<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/01/fallout-76-wastelanders-reviews/">Wastelanders</a> version? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> bring back the broken matchmaking from launch? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> launch edition? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> reintroduce jet packs?</p>

<p>I’m obviously being flippant, but the problem with leaning on nostalgia like this is that it’s typically very fleeting. You can’t truly recapture that magic of experiencing something for the first time, or playing through it with a group of friends who you likely don’t see online anymore. Maybe you’ll raise the banner for a brief weekend or two, but people have moved on, things have changed, and you aren’t the same person you used to be. And when developers trot out their limited time nostalgia event for the third or fourth time, it’s not going to be anywhere near as impactful.</p>
<p>Does that hurt? Are we being emotionally manipulated? Of course we are. But no more so than a movie being re-released, or a book re-printed with flashy new covers. There is a comfort to be found in returning to the past, even if it’s only for a short while, and when game development is so cutthroat and competitive, this is one way for developers to keep the lights on, while feeding and pacifying a community that they’ve built over many years. Hopefully, it gives them time to look at what’s next, building characters, games and modes that will spark the same powerful emotions that the original ones did. It’s smart, it’s sustainable, and it sure as hell makes a lot of money.</p>
<p>So, for the moment, nostalgia is the best game mode, but we’d best drive back out of this creative cul-de-sac before we run out of petrol. Now, where <em>are</em> my glasses?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is capable of delivering impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/">8K resolution gameplay in No Man's Sky</a>, so much so that the game's 8K mode could begin to change minds about the viability of such a high resolution.</p>
<p>The tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the popular game developed by Hello Games, highlighting how the game's 8K mode delivers extremely sharp visuals, thanks to PSSR, which upscales the game from a base resolution of around 2700p to 8K. The image quality remains impressive even in motion, proving once again how high base resolutions deliver much better upscaling results. Looking at performance, unlike what the in-game menus suggest, framerate is always capped at a properly paced 30 FPS in 8K mode, which makes the game absolutely playable in this mode. In addition, No Man's Sky seems to be the perfect showcase for an 8K resolution mode, as the game's high contrast and highly stylized visuals with long vistas suit such a high resolution incredibly well.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky on PS5 Pro Has 8K Support... And We've Tested It" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBjU3v67s_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro is delivering impressive results in patched games like No Man's Sky, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system isn't delivering the touted 45% improvement over the base model in unpatched games. This is likely caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/">memory bandwidth constraints</a> that prevent games from taking full advantage of the system's power without a proper patch. Still, the improvements are there, making the system a worthy one to purchase for those who want to enjoy PS5 games at their possible best. You can learn more about the system in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/"> review.</a></p>

As a first-party Microsoft game, Avowed launches day one on Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the Battle.net launch that’s of most interest here, because it means you’ll be able to buy the game with World of Warcraft gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works: WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a WoW Token is going for 262,365 gold (the price fluctuates as demand rises and falls). At its cheapest, Avowed costs $69.99, which means you’ll need five WoW Tokens to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to buy the game. That equates to 1.3 million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of gold most players probably don’t have lying around. But with Avowed three months from launch, there is time to get that WoW gold grind going, if you’re determined to buy the game without actually buying the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Microsoft is selling up to five days of early access to Avowed via the Premium Edition, which costs $89.99 and also includes two premium skin packs and access to the digital artbook and soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It then spotted a Reddit user called Archbox (Archbox was a moderator of r/SwitchPirates). Based on their posts, the law firm was able to identify Archbox as James Williams. Williams, it turns out, had various Nintendo accounts associated with email addresses, which were tied to repair orders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Williams, an alleged Switch pirate, actually made two repair orders with Nintendo tied to a Surprise, Arizona shipping address.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, cease-and-desists followed — one of which came just two days after Nintendo sent him one of his repaired items. The pirate shops Archbox was allegedly involved with include Jack-in-the-Shop, Turtle in the Shop, and NekoDrive, which all shut down following a cease-and-desist Nintendo sent in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendant became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members," Nintendo’s initial complaint reads, as reported by <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrent Freak</a>.
