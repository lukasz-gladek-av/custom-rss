            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has reneged on one of its promises for last year's <em>Skate </em>reboot, namely that the game will feature "no map areas locked behind paywalls".</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> outlining what's coming to <em>Skate </em>in the future, EA says that the game's third season will introduce the new Isle of Grom map, which has been expanded and filled with new areas to explore.</p><p>Initially, only <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium holders will be able to explore the Isle of Grom, but after the first month, the map will be opened up to everyone for a "very special multi-week event". That event is limited, though; afterwards, you'll have to pay in one form or another to access the Isle of Grom.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Skate</em>'s new map is pretty much locked behind a paywall. Yuck.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the aforementioned "very special" event, you'll either need to hold the <em>Skate </em>Pass Premium or pay in-game Rip Chips to access the Isle of Grom, and the latter will only net you a 24-hour pass, so it's not permanent.</p><p>Technically speaking - and I mean real fine-print technical here - the new map isn't really locked behind a paywall per se, because you can theoretically access it without paying real money.</p><p>Still, though, I'd say this is a contravention of what EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="966b1818-c2c5-4648-9899-942a622c5274" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">promised all the way back in 2022</a> in spirit, if not absolutely in letter. It's not a great look to need to argue the finer detail rather than the broader picture.</p><p>Perhaps more insultingly, in response to a player asking why EA stepped away from the no-maps-behind-paywalls promise, the company rather dismissively <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">says</a> that "plans have to change" sometimes, and that "that's part of the deal when you're building in public".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In fact, one X <a href="https://x.com/its6767/status/2024645684272480620" rel="nofollow">user</a> points out that just one week ago, <em>Skate</em>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213192103/https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">website FAQ</a> declared that "new areas of San Vansterdam (the game's world) will always be free and available to all players...if it's there, you can go there". Suffice it to say the FAQ <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/faq" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">no longer</a> features that passage.</p><p>Of course, the obvious question to ask here is this: if EA can walk back this promise, what's to stop the company ditching the others in the above image too? How long before <em>Skate </em>features pay-to-win elements, paid loot boxes, or paid gameplay advantages?</p><p>For now, at the very least, if you want to access <em>Skate</em>'s Isle of Grom map beyond May, you're going to have to pay for it in some form. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

		<p><em>Football is over. Baseball is almost here. Basketball, entering its far more interesting post-All Star stretch, is finally going to get interesting. </em></p><p><em>But there are sports beyond America's big three, so why not dream bigger? Why not consider the possibility of becoming interested in something...new? Could another form of disappointment exist?</em></p><p><em>At least, that's where Patrick's head is at as the Super Bowl heads into the rear view mirror and the biggest discourse amongst Chicago Bears fans is </em><a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/nfl/chicago-bears/chicago-bears-release-statement-as-indiana-stadium-bill-inches-closer-to-reality/3896412/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>whether to pay a bunch of billionaires to build a stadium</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Which they should not do, by the way. Even though they probably will.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I was fortunate enough to be extremely busy this past Sunday, which meant I had no time to process that it was the first time in many months without any football on TV. I like basketball, I often love baseball, but god damnit, football is the one that gets me out of bed. I’ve got the Olympics on in the background like white noise, but it’s mostly that: pleasant background chatter. Perhaps it’s time to try something new. To be daring. Rob, I think it’s time to get into F1.</p><p>My friend, who is very F1-pilled, pointed out that I’d muttered about this idea a few times, and he pointed out that the new season of Netflix’s <em>Drive to Survive</em> season is kicking off at the end of the month. I am not going to watch seven seasons of <em>Drive to Survive</em>, so you can stop right there. But look, I did watch the incredibly mediocre <em>F1</em> movie from Apple, aka the poor man’s <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, and at least came away interested in learning more about the drama of it all.&nbsp;</p><p>When I got into football, I downloaded a bunch of podcasts, signed up for fantasy football—I tried to find various avenues into the sport beyond a generational fandom to the Chicago Bears.</p><p><em>Drive to Survive</em>, at least, seems like the easiest and no nonsense way to lock in before the new F1 season starts in early March. But I’m also considering a podcast to join me on my regular outdoors runs as the weather starts to warm up. I ask: Who is the most Chicago-coded F1 team? If I’m to start rooting for a single driver/team, who can I pick without being an asshole?</p><p>Help me, Rob.</p><p><strong>Rob: </strong>If we had forums, this prompt is a "discussion locked after 1052 pages" kind of thing. I do this shit for a living with <em>Shift+F1 </em>but <em>Patrick </em>asking me to find him <em>the Bears </em>of F1? Suddenly there's real pressure! This is my chance to convert you!</p><p>I woke up thinking about this and spent my entire shower arguing with myself about my answer, because there were three teams that immediately sprang to mind, but I realized two have better NFL analogues. We'll get to those in a minute.</p><h3 id="the-chicago-bears-of-f1-williams"><strong>The Chicago Bears of F1: </strong>Williams</h3><p>Williams was a family operation that was a predominant power in an earlier era of F1. One of the absolute best sports documentaries I've ever seen is simply <em>Williams</em>, and what starts as a straightforward team history ends up being a painfully intimate portrait of a family that apparently never talked about their issues <em>until a film crew came asking questions</em>! It's very clear that the whole operation started as Frank Williams' obsession and turned into a burdensome legacy for his wife, and then his children. The team spent the 2000s and 2010s sliding into embarrassing irrelevance as the Williams family's finances fell behind the investment required to compete in the sport. The team has one of the highest trophy counts in F1, but for about five years its cars were reliably near last place. The second or third season of <em>Drive to Survive </em>shows the lead designer and owner flying commercial, with car parts strapped into the seats next to them because they weren't able to finish their car in time for the start of testing.</p><p>So you basically have all this stale prestige from the equivalent of the George Halas era, and a grim decline. But the team sold to an investment group a few years ago and they hired a Ben Johnson-like figure, James Vowles. He was regarded as one of the strategic geniuses behind an incredible championship run at the Mercedes team. He's got a goofy charisma: he's an awkward nerd but genuine and unguarded in a way most team principals (basically coach <em>and</em> GM) are not. He's savvy about it, too. The Williams Youtube presence is the best in F1, a mix of good self-analysis, oddly cinematic behind-the-scenes films, and a video podcast starring their drivers called <em>Team Torque</em>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0FGuP09iJo?list=PLKwAx-HaumhyzJeW0yN_n8sANOTKTyKCM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p><em>Team Torque </em>is in a golden age right now because Williams also has the two most personable drivers on the grid. Alex Albon is a lot like Vowles: awkward and a bit strange, obsessed with his pets, but kind of hilarious. Carlos Sainz is newer to the team, a well-regarded driver who was treated like a secondary driver rather than a team leader at. He's become a bit of a hearththrob and leans into it in a self-deprecating way, flirting shamelessly with Albon in every episode of <em>Team Torque</em>. But in between the grabassing and tangents they will also give you some of the most honest, reflective talk about the state of racing that you hear from any drivers.</p><p>Williams is still an organization that has years of organizational rot to dig out. The people working there might be great but 20 years of operating on a shoestring left them pretty dysfunctional, and there are some signs that after a great season last year, they've stumbled badly with the huge overhaul to car design required for this season. But what could be more Bears? They might be about to plunge into mediocrity after a false dawn, or they might be carrying on with a rebuilding that's finally under the right leadership. With Williams you only get heartbreak and disappointment or heartwarming underdog success.</p><p>Now I told you there were two other teams I considered for my answer but I realized there are better parallels.</p><h3 id="the-dallas-cowboys-of-f1-ferrari"><strong>The Dallas Cowboys of F1: </strong>Ferrari.</h3>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968</link>
            <guid>1441636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Pokémon Company finally, in the dead of night, announced its annual Pokémon Day Presents showcase. This is the stream the company hosts every year on February 27 to celebrate the franchise’s anniversary. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is turning 30 in 2026, so there’s probably a lot to share ahead of the coming year. Here’s what we know and what we can likely expect to see next week.</span></p> <h2><b>When and where can I watch?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents stream will air on Friday, February 27, at 9 a.m. Eastern/6 a.m. Pacific. You can catch it on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon"><span>official </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>YouTube</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon"><span>Twitch</span></a><span> channels to watch it live, or as a VOD if you can’t tune into the show as it premieres. We’ll also have a recap of what we see here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> if you just want the highlights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>What do we know?</b></h2> <p><span>Right now, the only project confirmed to make an appearance are the </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>ports that were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>announced alongside the presentation</span></a><span>. The showcase will last 25 minutes, according to the </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/2024755907343557064"><span>Japanese Pokémon Twitter account</span></a><span>, which makes it </span><a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/2024760273723146356"><span>one of the longer Pokémon Day showcases</span></a><span> since Nintendo and friends started hosting these.</span></p> <h2><b>What will we likely see?</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon Presents showcases cover pretty much everything going on in the franchise right now, so if you’re only interested in the next big RPG, be ready to endure segments devoted to other things. We’ll see updates on mobile games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Masters EX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon Sleep</span></i><span>, as well as other major pillars of the franchise like the anime and </span><i><span>Trading Card Game</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>is also out the following week, so I’m sure we’ll see at least a little bit more of that game as we approach its March 5 release date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since this is the 30th anniversary, we can probably expect some portion of the showcase to be dedicated to upcoming events, both online and off, celebrating the milestone. The Pokémon Company has confirmed plans to hold separate events for both families and adults with its </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/get-ready-to-celebrate-30-years-of-pokemon"><span>Day Out and Night Out events,</span></a><span> with the former being geared toward all ages and the latter being suited for “longtime fans,” which is code for people who were relatively cognizant when the series debuted 30 years ago. Right now, we don’t know what these events will entail, so a 30th anniversary stream is as good a place as any to finally lift the curtain.</span></p>

 <p><span>Based on the many leaks that have come from Game Freak over the past few years, we know a fair bit about the upcoming Generation X games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>reportedly called </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i></a><span>. It’s very likely that these RPGs will take up a good portion of the showcase. I would be very surprised if </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>didn’t release a new RPG during its 30th year, and the leaks heavily imply these games are next on the docket, so we could be seeing the next generation of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>next week.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whatever is announced, we’ll have coverage of the stream here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> as it’s happening.</span></p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem offers different difficulty options, which are slightly different from what you’d expect from the difficulty settings in recent Resi games. If you’re having a hard time deciding between the two concerning your playthrough, this guide has everything you need to know.</p>



<p>You know how difficulty settings usually go in these games: Easy, Normal, Hard, and then a harder variant once you complete the game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> borrows one of its most iconic game mechanics to present a headache.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-classic-amp-modern-difficulty-settings-in-resident-evil-requiem">What’s The Difference Between Classic &amp; Modern Difficulty Settings in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An age-old classic. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The main difference between Normal and Classic difficulty in Resident Evil Requiem is that you need to find and use Ink Ribbons to save in Classic Mode when using Grace, with limited autosaves, whereas Normal will use a traditional save system.</strong></p>



<p>Ah, Ink Ribbons…the suspenseful and unusual resource that makes you question whether you <em>really </em>need to save in Resident Evil games.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>They first appeared in the debut Resident Evil game and became a staple of the gameplay for a few years. They have largely been neglected now in favor of modern save systems, but Requiem is bringing them back, to an extent.</p>



<p>Capcom’s RESIDENT EVIL Showcase revealed that multiple difficulties were available, with Normal and Classic being the focal point of your first playthrough options—along with a Casual mode for those seeking an easier challenge.</p>



<p>Here’s the description for each. Expect there to be another one or two harder settings once you finish the main game.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Resident Evil Requiem Difficulty Setting</th><th data-align="center">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Casual</td><td data-align="center">“Relax while enjoying the story and puzzles.”</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Modern)</td><td data-align="center">“A balanced experience of suspense and accomplishment at the standard difficulty found among modern Resident Evil games.<p>This game mode can be changed to Casual on the game over screen.”</p></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Standard (Classic)</td><td data-align="center">“A traditional experience with a difficulty similar to classic Resident Evil games. Recommended for long-term fans of the series.<p>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are limited and ink ribbons are required to save.”</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<h2 id="h-should-you-choose-classic-or-modern-in-resident-evil-requiem">Should You Choose Classic or Modern in Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As Capcom suggests, the difficulty depends on three factors: If you just want to and enjoy the game and story with few to no deaths, if you like a normal challenge, or if you enjoy the suspense of archaic Resi gameplay with limited resources.</strong></p>



<p>Personally, we are long-time Resident Evil fans, so the Standard (Classic) is the obvious choice.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Release Date &amp; Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re a newcomer, then Standard (Classic) might be better, and Casual is for those new to horror games, or like the genre but are threatened by them, or if you want to blitz through and lap up the story beats.</p>

Even then, though, Radcliffe said he was instantly aware that this was "a bad idea."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the worst ideas I've ever heard, during Potter, somebody came to us and I think asked... like they wanted to cast all three of us, me, Emma and Rupert, in a remake of Wizard of Oz," Radcliffe revealed. "Emma was Dorothy, I can't remember what Rupert was, and I just remember that I was going to be the lion, but also he knew karate?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was like a karate kicking cowardly lion," he continued. "And I remember I was like 14 or 15, and I was like, 'I don't know a lot about the world, but this is a bad idea, this should not be made."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the timeline here would place Radcliffe and his co-stars as filming the fourth Harry Potter book, Goblet of Fire. So, had the Wizard of Oz remake progressed, the trio would still have been fairly young — though not too dissimilar to the age of 16-year-old Judy Garland in the story's classic 1939 adaptation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Harry Potter HBO TV Series Cast and Characters: Who's Confirmed for the Reboot?</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous Wizard of Oz adaptations have surfaced over the years, including various spin-offs, prequels and sequels. These include the 2013 Sam Raimi-directed Oz the Great and Powerful, which starred James Franco, Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis, and of course the two-part Wicked, starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Radcliffe discussed HBO's upcoming new adaptation of Harry Potter, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/id-like-to-not-be-weird-spectral-phantoms-in-these-childrens-lives-daniel-radcliffe-says-dont-ask-the-new-harry-potter-tv-show-kids-about-him">issued a plea for the series' new young cast to be allowed to get on with their work</a> without the original movies' cast becoming "spectral phantoms" in their lives.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

<figcaption>Could the followup to <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet </em>finally be on the horizon?</figcaption>

<p>We already know one thing that's going to be featured during the show, namely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch release of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></a>, which was confirmed earlier today. The games will launch just after the showcase concludes.</p><p>What else we'll see during this Pokemon Presents is a mystery for now, although we can make some educated guesses; it's likely that mobile games <em>Pokemon Cafe ReMix </em>and <em>Pokemon Masters EX</em> will appear, as they usually do, and we'll probably hear from <em>Pokemon Unite </em>as well.</p><p>Outside of the realms of virtual certainty, I'd be very surprised indeed if this presentation doesn't contain at least a nod to the upcoming tenth <em>Pokemon </em>generation. Back in October, a massive <em>Pokemon </em>leak <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a709d9-d361-46d9-823d-aa0957eba8ed" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">seemingly revealed details about gen ten</a>, so the clock's ticking on an official reveal.</p><p>We may also see more DLC announced for last year's <em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>. The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d5d3818-49a2-4447-89bf-e19e298fa0df" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold very well indeed</a>, so a second DLC pack after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a7fab66-8e9f-461b-8e80-b39e300cbd1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Mega Dimension</em></a><em> </em>seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>Whatever gets announced, the next Pokemon Presents will be airing on February 27th at 6am PT/9am ET/2pm GMT.

At the conclusion of a new video celebrating the 10 million achievement, a message simply reads "<em>NieR: Automata </em>to be continued...".</p><p>It's worth noting that the rest of the video is entirely in Japanese, so it's possible that this is a mistranslation, or that the message simply points to more <em>NieR: Automata </em>media in future. Perhaps a current-gen port could even be on the cards.</p><p>Still, <em>NieR: Automata </em>remains the last new mainline release in the <em>NieR </em>series at time of writing, so I don't think it's unreasonable to hope that Square Enix could be gearing up to give Yoko Taro another chance to hold the reins this year.</p><p>You can watch the aforementioned video, which celebrates <em>NieR: Automata</em>'s achievements over the years, right here.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>NieR: Automata</em>, it's an action game that serves as a collaboration between iconoclastic designer Yoko Taro and action luminaries PlatinumGames.</p><p>The game revolves around 2B, an android who slowly begins to question her existence as a war with machines threatens to develop into something more complex than she initially believed.</p><p>You can check out <em>NieR: Automata </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/nier-automata/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/nierautomata-become-as-gods-edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/NieR-Automata-The-End-of-YoRHa-Edition-2232461.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's playable on current-gen systems through backwards compatibility as well.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">The rumors were true!</a> As <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021518874785841331%7Ctwgr%5E84390244049800bd06a3aa327dea273d54fee7b6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fpokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213">anticipated</a> by Pokémon leaker Khu, <i>Pokémon FireRed&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>LeafGreen—</i>the Game Boy Advance remakes of the original English-language&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games—are coming to Switch and Switch 2 February 27. They’ll be available as downloads as soon as the 30th anniversary Pokémon Direct comes to an end.</p> <p>So yes indeed, this confirms what was absolutely certain: that there would be a Pokémon Direct this Pokémon Day, during which it seems utterly impossible that we won’t get our first glimpse of Gen X Pokémon and the new mainline game in which they’ll appear. We now also have the time: February 27, 2026 at 9 a.m. ET.</p>

  <p>The arrival of these two 22-year-old versions of a 30-year-old game as a paid download, and not as new entries in the GBA section of Nintendo’s Online subscription package, is a bizarre and pretty shocking choice. Some might say a mercenary one. There surely was the potential that they could have been made available for free to celebrate the franchise’s 30th birthday, and given how ancient they are and how appropriate it would be…that’s obviously not happening. It’s Nintendo. If your uncle worked for Nintendo, he’d charge you for those imaginary leaks. So yeah, astonishingly the company has the complete gall to charge $20 for each. And it won’t even support online features.</p> <p>Ew, what a horrid taste that leaves in my mouth. The GBA versions of these two games had sold a combined total of 11.82 million copies in their first four years on sale. That’s over $400 million. They kinda made their money back. Nintendo could so easily celebrate this huge anniversary by having these be available for free, or at least a couple of bucks, gain so much good will, and get nostalgic players hyped for <em>Pokémon</em> again ahead of the release of the new game this winter. Gah. Twenty sodding dollars.</p>

 <p>And if you’re thinking, “But surely someone at Nintendo must be aware how bad this looks?” you’re right! Because this announcement comes with the most extraordinary FAQ in which Nintendo asks itself everyone you and I would want to know, and then <em>evades its own questions</em>.</p>

 <blockquote><p><b>“Will these games also be coming to the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection?</b>These games are being offered as standalone software and are not planned for release as part of the Game Boy Advance – Nintendo Classics collection.</p> <p><b>Why are you handling these classic games differently?</b>In celebration of 30 years of Pokémon, we thought it would be fun to return to the ultimate versions of the original Pokémon adventures in the Kanto region with these special releases.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s incredible, right! Like there’s this voice inside Nintendo’s head, the voice of reason, and it’s trying to understand why it’s making these choices, but then shouted down by non-answers that don’t address the issue at all. It’s not even the only time it happens in this FAQ:</p> <blockquote><p><b>“Will you add the original Pokémon Red Version and Pokémon Blue Version or other Pokémon games to the Nintendo Classics collections available with Nintendo Switch Online?</b></p> <p>The following Pokémon game is currently part of the Game Boy – Nintendo Classics collection, available with a Nintendo Switch Online membership:</p> <p>[List of non-mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games]”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s like watching a politician being interviewed on TV, and being left screaming at the screen because the interviewer didn’t follow up.</p>

<p>Nostalgia for Pokémon fans is through the roof ahead of Pokémon Day 2026, with a slew of news set to be announced, and the re-release of Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on Nintendo Switch platforms is on the horizon.</p>



<p>22 years after an initial release, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green are coming to both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as re-releases. Unlike other classic games, these will be a separate purchase and won’t be included with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online/" id="1413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch Online</a> membership.</p>



<p>If you’re already counting down the hours until you can explore the Kanto region again, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and launch times.</p>

<p><strong>Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch systems on Friday, February 27, landing as part of the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Day celebrations.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of the re-release</a> of the titles originally released on Game Boy Advance two decades ago came a week ahead of their release. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-return-teased-by-leaker/" id="175794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously leaked</a> that the titles would be made available again.</p>

</ul>



<p>Full Pokémon Home connectivity will be added to the titles at a later date, increasing the number of available Pokémon in the game. In the original release, players could transfer Pokémon from other titles like Gold, Silver, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear when Pokémon Home functionality will be available, and whether previous events in the game will be made available.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-nintendo-switch-start-times">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green Nintendo Switch Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green will be released on Nintendo Switch platforms following the conclusion of the Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27.</strong></p>



<p>No precise time for the drop has been shared, and it’s not clear if the titles will be immediately available after the conclusion of the showcase. However, if they’re not available as soon as the show ends, it’s likely to only be a short wait until they’re in the store.</p>

<p>Styx: Blades of Greed dropped <strong>yesterday</strong>, presenting players with a stealth-driven, goblin-backed adventure packed with brutal kills, open environments, and quips from a protagonist accurately described as ‘caustic’.</p>



<p>In the reviews surfacing online, Styx has been doing very well for itself, earning decent scores from critics. It’s the third game in the series, which emerged in 2014 with Styx: Master of Shadows. In a recent post on social media, the developers took the opportunity to throw shade at competing franchises based on the positivity surrounding the launch of Blades of Greed.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay-attention-assassin-s-creed">Pay Attention, Assassin’s Creed</h2>



<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was given a positive review by Eurogamer, and the social team at Cyanide Studio took it upon themselves to go on the offensive against other developers. Of course, it’s all in the character of Styx himself, a volatile goblin prone to self-deprecation, harsh humor, and sarcastic one-liners.</p>



<p>When news of the positive reviews hit the airwaves, Cyanide went straight to social media, calling out Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed brand:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It didn’t end there. One user asked what Styx would do when faced with the ‘GOAT Sam Fisher’, the frontman of the legendary Splinter Cell series, arguably the most iconic stealth shooter ever made.</p>



<p>In response, the team at Cyanide simply wrote, ‘Sam Fisher stays in the shadows.’</p>



<p>It got a bit close to the wire when someone asked them to comment in French, so Ubisoft could ‘understand properly,’ and the social team wrote:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Styx has also openly challenged the likes of Agent 47 and Big Boss, which is ambitious.</p>







<p>Have you played Styx: Blades of Greed? Is the game good enough to warrant the arrogance from the developer’s social media team? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Titanium Court Is Just The Right Amount Of So Much]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/titanium-court-demo/</link>
            <guid>1441585</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The other evening, in those weird hours when it’s too early to go to bed but too late to dig into a new task without ruining any chance of going to bed, I was looking for a new game to play. I remembered seeing mention of the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2364580/Titanium_Court/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Titanium Court</u></em></a>, a game that in its <a href="https://aftermath.site/dawnfolk-impressions-review/"><em><u>Dawnfolk</u></em></a> vibes felt like it might be something small and lightweight to poke around in at the end of the day. It was not that. I don’t quite <em>know</em> what it is, but I like it.</p><p><em>Titanium Court</em> appears to be several games in one. There’s a match-3 section, and a battle section, and a whole narrative of a fantasy kingdom in which you wander into a party one night and then discover you are the queen, tasked with fighting enemy forces while you try to get out of there. Here’s a trailer that doesn’t explain anything:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSxuuoYkR3o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Titanium Court Reveal Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>The gameplay part of all this involves fighting enemies in a two-phase battle that takes place on a tiled grid. In the first phase, called High Tide, you match resource tiles into lines of three to remove them from the grid. Matching features like water, hills, and fields gives you resources like food, rocks, and wood. You can also arrange the landscape to better protect the square representing your kingdom from enemy troops, surrounding it with hills or water. Matching multiple groups of three in a row also gives you more turns to play during this phase, making the whole thing a complicated mini-strategy game. </p><p>In the second phase, called Low Tide, you spend the resources you’ve gathered to deploy soldiers or farmers. The farmers gather more resources as the battle rages (provided you left some resource tiles on the field for them to harvest), while the soldiers go out to destroy enemy strongholds or fight to keep enemies from reaching your kingdom. You don’t control your troops; you just watch their tiny fights take place interspersed with images of cricket players, cats knocking things off tables, and Jenga towers that represent the tide of battle.</p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson</span></figcaption></figure><p>Complications get added as the demo goes on. Special buildings can appear on the grid that you can access during Low Tide, but only if you keep them on the grid during High Tide, trying not to match them even when it’s <em>very</em> tempting. These can be hospitals that heal you, or shops where you can buy items; I was especially fond of a mirror I could arrange next to my kingdom to get two-for-one troops. Enemies get more varied, with catapults you can fend off by surrounding your kingdom with hills, or flying enemies who frequently mobbed by kingdom. </p><p>Layered atop all <em>this </em>is moving your kingdom along a roguelike map that even the game admits is confusing as hell, trying to make it to some kind of exit. And surrounding all <em>that</em> is the narrative element, which frequently breaks the fourth wall and is full of surreal jokes, talking cats, and a seeming conflict between the in-game narrative and the demo’s tooltips.</p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure><p>It would be easy for all this to become grating, but instead these narrative bits never overstay their welcome, lasting just long enough to be funny without becoming too much. Absurd maximalism is deeply not my thing, but it totally works here; characters in the game seem just as confused as you, and it creates this vibe that you're all in this together, trying to survive and make sense of this very strange world. </p><figure><figcaption><span>AP Thomson</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Titanium Court </em>is weird as hell and completely charming, enjoyable both to play and just to <em>experience</em>, which feels like an impressive balance to pull off. The demo is available now, and the full game is "coming soon" according to Steam, though there's no release date yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen our fair share of Pikachu plushies over the years (it's only one of the most recognisable faces in media <em>ever</em>, after all), but few have been quite as lifelike as this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wow! Stuff and RealFX unveiled their latest creation: the Pikachu Puppetronic. As that name suggests, this is a puppet with a traditional hand-controlled design, combined with a fair amount of electronics for even more movement and expression.</p>
<p>We're talking dual-motion ears, blinking eyes, light-up cheeks, a moving mouth, and sensors all over its head, body and neck, so it can react to your touch. Throw in "over 120 sounds and actions", and this is probably as close as you can come to having ol' anime Pika in your home.</p>
<p>Naturally, it doesn't come cheap. The first wave of pre-orders went up on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/product/72-11257-101/pikachu-puppetronic-by-real-fx">the Pokémon Center UK website</a> yesterday for <strong>£89.99</strong> and almost immediately sold out. Admittedly, there may have been a rush on these thanks to the inclusion of a special "First Edition" badge and certificate to up the FOMO, but we wouldn't be surprised to see folks clamouring for these for a while yet.</p>

<p>It's all very sweet, but there's a bit of us that finds the puppet a little... freaky. There's something about the blinking eyes, the vacant expression, and the promise that it can move on its own that pushes things closer to the uncanny valley than we'd like. A cute plushie, we can deal with, but one that might open its mouth and blurt out a "Pika Pi" in the middle of the night? *<em>gulp</em>*</p>
<p>The puppetronic is expected to ship in mid-spring 2026, so keep an eye out for restocks in the coming months, if this looks up your street.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Allegedly Tried to Buy Ashes of Creation in 2022-2023; Intrepid CEO Steven Sharif Files Counter-Lawsuit]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-creation-riot-games-acquisition-sharif-counter-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1441567</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The story behind the MMORPG <strong>Ashes of Creation</strong>, its development team (<strong>Intrepid Studios</strong>), its founder and CEO <strong>Steven Sharif</strong>, and its major investors (<strong>Robert Dawson</strong>, <strong>Jason Caramanis</strong>) continues to get messier.</p>



<p>As you might remember, Jason Caramanis publicly accused Steven Sharif of fraud, embezzlement, and other illegal acts, and mentioned that Sharif would be the target of several lawsuits, including one already filed by <strong>TFE Games Holdings</strong> against Steven Sharif and his husband, John Moore, <strong>on February 9, 2026</strong>, in the Nevada District Court, Clark County. However, a few days ago, Sharif himself <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/72286984/1/sharif-v-dawson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>filed a counter-lawsuit</strong></a> in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, against Robert Dawson and others (<strong>not against Caramanis, though</strong>), including the aforementioned <strong>TFE Games Holdings LLC</strong>, a Delaware-based LLC created and controlled by Dawson that the filing describes as having been created for the sole purpose of receiving, exploiting, and monetizing Intrepid's trade secrets and intellectual property.</p>



<p>One of the most explosive revelations from the new legal documents is that between late 2022 and early 2023, a major game development company <strong>offered hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire Ashes of Creation and the studio behind it</strong>. However, Dawson allegedly urged Sharif to reject the deal in favor of continuing development under his financing, which eventually led to the talks with the acquiring company ending. This company is never named in the filing, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p-mL-Nlq4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new video interview with NefasQS</a>, who was the first one to break the veil of mystery on this whole controversy, Caramanis reveals that "<strong>the only company that I know they had dialogues with that they communicated with was Riot</strong>."</p>



<p>Needless to say, it's a surprising turn of events (albeit not officially confirmed) that the public didn't know about before. Riot's backing could have certainly helped Ashes of Creation, although they have been working on their own <strong>League of Legends MMO</strong> for several years without anything to show for it. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was rebooted in March 2024</a></strong>, and we still haven't learned anything concrete about it.</p>



<p>Anyway, the counter-lawsuit frames this as the turning point in their relationship: Sharif alleges that, seeing the company's real potential for extremely high returns, <strong>Dawson then began a campaign to seize control of the company</strong>, but notably, he did so "without consideration for the quality of the game and the typical development timeline of MMORPGs."</p>



<p>The allegations made by Sharif against Dawson only get harsher from here on. According to Sharif, from <strong>early 2023 through May 2024</strong>, Dawson repeatedly threatened to withhold payroll and health insurance financing just before payroll deadlines, to shut the company down through litigation, and to cause Sharif <strong>financial ruin and physical harm</strong>, unless Sharif signed documents granting him progressively greater equity and control. The filing lists the following examples:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dawson demanded <strong>a warrant granting him 10% of the company for $10</strong></li>



<li>He demanded <strong>zero-cost non-dilutable equity options</strong> in his convertible debt notes</li>



<li>He <strong>required Sharif to involve him in all discussions with company counsel,</strong> despite having no right to that access (at least according to Sharif)</li>



<li>He <strong>falsely represented that he was an agent of the Company</strong> to retain Company counsel</li>
</ul>



<p>Steven Sharif <strong>claimed to have suffered from severe health issues due to these undue threats and pressure</strong>, including a hypertensive emergency, acute kidney failure, hospitalization, and vision loss from blood pressure complications, including macular edema. </p>



<p>As a result of debt-to-equity conversions under the <strong>May 2024 Settlement Agreement</strong>, <strong>Dawson became the majority shareholder</strong><span><strong>, holding</strong>&nbsp;4,008.67 shares of Class A, B, and C Common Stock, representing</span> roughly <strong>58% of all shares in Intrepid Studios</strong>. Under that same agreement, Sharif <strong>expressly retained full creative control of the Company</strong>, even as Dawson gained financial and governance control.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RIOT Games Was Supposed to Buy Ashes of Creation???" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p-mL-Nlq4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>At a subsequent Board meeting that took place on September 4, 2024, Dawson was appointed Chairman of the Board, and <strong>Ryan Ogden</strong> was appointed Chief Financial Officer. Dawson then directed Ogden to open new Intrepid bank accounts at Pathway Bank, which the lawsuit frames as a bank over which Dawson exercises de facto or de jure control. From this point, Sharif<strong> was effectively stripped of all financial authority and ceased to have any access to active company bank accounts</strong>. By August 2025, Dawson added Theresa Fette and Aaron Bartels (both of whom are also among the lawsuit's defendants) to the board. From that point until Sharif's formal resignation dated January 19, 2026, <strong>the full board consisted of Dawson, Ogden, Fette, Bartels, and Sharif</strong>, who claimed that Ogden, Fette, and Bartels were acting at Dawson's behest rather than as independent directors.</p>



<p>Even the early access launch of Ashes of Creation, clearly rushed by most gamers' judgment, <strong>was forced by the board against Sharif's and other senior leadership's advice</strong>, at least according to Sharif's own reconstruction of the events. The filing also states that prior to the board's interference, Ashes of Creation had achieved an unusually strong Day 30 player retention rate of approximately 76%.</p>



<p>Critically, it is alleged that Ryan Ogden <strong>specifically assured CommerceWest Bank that Steam revenue from the Early Access launch would cover the outstanding loan obligations</strong>. As a reminder, Caramanis had alleged that Sharif was notified by Valve that a Steam payout was incoming, and then Sharif deliberately allowed or directed those funds to flow to the CommerceWest Bank loan, which Caramanis described as Sharif essentially using company money to cover a personal debt, since the $6 million loan was personally guaranteed by his husband, John Moore.</p>



<p>The two accounts actually agree on the assurance given to CommerceWest Bank, but <strong>the funds themselves appear to still be frozen</strong>. Prior to the foreclosure, Ogden had specifically directed Valve to divert the Steam revenue owed to Intrepid into a new Pathway Bank account opened for TFE, but <strong>Valve refused to comply</strong>. On February 3, 2026, <strong>Valve terminated Intrepid's Steam partnership entirely</strong>, citing multiple conflicting requests from alleged account administrators trying to change Intrepid's banking information, demands from multiple potential creditors for Intrepid's revenues, and a large volume of player refund requests. The filing states that before refunds, <strong>Intrepid would have been entitled to approximately $5 million from Steam</strong>.</p>



<p>Sharif's counter-lawsuit lists eight specific violations of the law:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Defend Trade Secrets Act</strong> (federal): Misappropriation of Intrepid's IP and trade secrets</li>



<li><strong>California Uniform Trade Secrets Act</strong>: The same, albeit under state law</li>



<li><strong>California Commercial Code violations</strong>: The Article 9 foreclosure was procedurally unlawful, commercially unreasonable, and conducted without required notice to senior creditors</li>



<li><strong>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: Board defendants failed their duties of loyalty, care, candor, and independence to the company and shareholders</li>



<li><strong>Aiding and Abetting Breach of Fiduciary Duty</strong>: This one specifically targets TFE for knowingly facilitating the board's breaches</li>



<li><strong>Corporate Waste</strong>: The board's actions were so reckless and devoid of legitimate business purpose that they constituted a waste of corporate assets</li>



<li><strong>Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</strong>: A direct personal claim by Sharif, based on the deliberate campaign to destroy his reputation and safety</li>



<li><strong>Civil Conspiracy</strong>: All defendants knowingly conspired to misappropriate IP and trade secrets and to scapegoat Sharif publicly</li>
</ol>



<p> The filing requests a variety of remedies, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>An injunction to prevent the defendants from accessing, using, or selling the trade secrets related to Ashes of Creation</li>



<li>The annulment of the wrongful foreclosure</li>



<li>Compensation for consequential and punitive damages</li>



<li>The disgorgement of profits</li>



<li>The removal of the board of directors</li>



<li>The establishment of a constructive trust</li>



<li>The payment of legal fees</li>



<li>Permanent injunctive relief against future misconduct</li>
</ul>



<p>By the way, Steven Sharif himself <strong>appeared in the YouTube chat of the linked NefasQS video to share this message</strong>:</p>



<p><em>My goal is maximum accountability. I am glad to see Jason commenting and sharing as much as he is, I think you are doing a great job with that @NefasQS, so thank you for that. It obviously would not make much sense for me to fight a battle in the court of public opinion, when the truth will come out obviously in court. Federal court is not like state court; there is a higher burden of factual proof required. I would not sign my name to that document if I was not certain of the truthfulness.</em></p>



<p>To say that the situation is intricate would be an understatement. We'll keep tracking the development of this legal battle; stay tuned.</p>

<p>In general, it seems that <em>Nioh 3 </em>is part of an upward trend for Koei Tecmo when it comes to initial sales; back in 2024, the studio also revealed that its Bakumatsu-era RPG <em>Rise of the Ronin </em>had surpassed the first two <em>Nioh </em>games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="67f991d6-0e1a-4301-9f20-4cef49c020a1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in terms of launch sales</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Nioh 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third game in the <em>Nioh </em>series, which blends <em>Souls</em>-esque combat and exploration with a focus on loot gathering and fast-paced combat.</p><p>In contrast to its predecessors, <em>Nioh 3 </em>allows you to travel between various eras in Japanese history, including the aforementioned Bakumatsu era, as well as the Edo, Sengoku, and Heian periods.</p><p>Much like in Team Ninja's other Soulslike RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ded52dd9-4edb-4dd7-b4c6-09ff708bab63" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a>, you'll meet and interact with historical figures from throughout these periods, including the likes of Hattori Hanzo, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and Himiko.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Nioh 3 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/nioh-3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>. There's been no mention of ports to other systems yet, but given that <em>Nioh </em>has historically been exclusive to PlayStation (and PC), it's unlikely.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s organisers are currently awaiting a chat with European Union politicians about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">server shutdowns rendering online-only games impossible to play</a>. Said chat's been set up by a petition which racked up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-amassed-just-under-13-million-verified-signatures-according-to-final-count">just under 1.3 million verified signatures</a> at its final count, with that being one of the alleys the group have gone down in pursuit of action against publishers being able to abandon games without leaving a way for them to be kept running.</p>
<p>Rather than simply adjusting their ties and googling nice places to visit on a trip to Brussels while they wait for their meeting, the group have announced some more action they'll be taking to get their message out in the ling term. Two Stop Killing Games non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are going to be set up to cover Europe and the US.</p>

<p>There are definite advantages [to launching these NGOs]," YouTuber Ross Scott said in the campaign's latest update video. "The first is this will allow us to do long-term counter lobbying on this issue. I mean, we're hoping to get the [European] Citizens Initiative passed or added to the Digital Fairness Act, but if those fail, there's still the possibility of being added to the Digital Content Directive revision. We're trying to find a way in any way we can. This will also signal that we're not just going away on this issue." He added that it'll "also allow for more watchdog action", such as the setting up of sites where players can report the situations of specific games to consumer protection agencies who may then take action.</p><p>As a social studies refresher, non-governmental organisations are typically groups which campaign about or take action to address specific issues - Oxfam fight inequality, Doctors without Borders tackle medical emergencies, the WWF promote wildlife conservation. As you might have gleaned from that list, many NGOs are non-profit charities funded by donations, but they can also draw funding from governments or run like for-profit businesses in some cases.</p>
<p>Ross cited Stop Killing Games campaigner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritz-katzner-473a54342/?locale=en">Moritz Katzner</a> as having spearheaded the push for these NGOs, with the German political activist also having led the charge on the campaign's EU petition. As for what'll come out of the meeting with EU lawmakers that petition's set up, Ross said the campaigners have "actually have no idea what to expect".</p>

            <p>Ubisoft are laying off around 40 people at Ubisoft Toronto, the studio behind the forthcoming remake of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>. That’s approximately eight percent of the studio headcount. It’s all in the service of Ubisoft’s drive to cut costs after restructuring their operations around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">a big dollop of Tencent funding</a>, which has elsewhere seen Ubisoft propose to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">lay off up to 200 people in Paris</a>, and chop fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As ever with layoff announcements, the accompanying statement consists of an anonymous spokesperson rotating a dial back and forth between “robotic platitude” and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">“ghastly euphemism”</a>, while looking back at the audience for approval. In this case, the dial is tilting towards “robotic platitude”.</p>
<p>“This decision was not taken lightly and does not in any way reflect the talent, dedication, or contributions of the individuals affected,” an Ubi rep told <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, as passed along by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-layoffs-at-toronto-studio-but-insists-splinter-cells-remake-is-still-coming/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance.”</p>
<p>MobileSyrup have also gotten hold of an internal email in which some company bigwig allegedly claims that Toronto will remain “a key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams,” in addition to developing Splinter Cell’s remake. The latter was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watch-the-new-tom-clancy-game-reveal-here-today">announced back in 2021</a> as a Snowdrop engine project. We’ve heard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-the-splinter-cell-remake-might-be-about-to-reappear-after-years-in-the-dark">very little</a> about it since. Splinter Cell is not one of the three flagship series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-didnt-cancel-beyond-good-evil-2-because-open-world-games-are-a-priority-but-i-suspect-the-real-reason-is-more-boring">identified by Ubi management as being potential “billionaire brands”</a>. As such, Splinter Cell projects are theoretically at more risk of being terminated, though Ubisoft have yet to cancel infamous vapourware game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>, so who knows.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">Begun in January</a>, Ubisoft’s Tencent-abetted restructuring has seen them cancel six games, delay seven others, and close a couple of studios, alongside company-wide layoffs. They’ve also announced a new RTO policy, with staff getting a yearly allowance of home days instead of proper hybrid working. All of which has provoked hundreds of Ubisoft workers to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">go on strike</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A dataminer has seemingly found links to the next game in the series in the God of War: Ragnarok files, which mention Athena and an Egyptian cat. </p>



<p>Since the announcement of the God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake</a> and the insider talks about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-developing-more-than-just-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica’s other game</a>, fans have been eagerly waiting for the next announcement. Many think it will be God of War in Egypt; however, we haven’t received confirmation for that yet. Now, some details about the next God of War game have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-ragnarok-sequel-appears-to-have-references-to-athena-and-egypt">God of War Ragnarok Sequel Appears to Have References to Athena and Egypt</h2>



<p>A new post on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1r986bw/found_athena_cutscene_and_atreus_in_his_travels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GodofWarRagnarok</a> subreddit discusses the datamine related to the next game. It seems this user found hidden content in God of War 2018 that turned out to be the beginning of Ragnarok (Atreus killing the bear, finding Tyr). Now, the user has found hidden content in Ragnarok’s files that could be part of the next game. </p>



<p>The datamined content includes a cutscene featuring Athena discussing Atreus and Odin. The Greek Goddess of Wisdom is apparently also referenced as the ‘Robed One’ in this cutscene. Athena’s dialogues are “To lefkó fídi tha se fáei,” which is Greek for “The white snake will eat you,” and “One failed us. One rejected us,” probably referencing Odin failing the ones from the higher plane and Atreus rejecting the mask.</p>



<p>There’s also a cutscene for Atreus, where he talks to a character called ‘Mau’. Mau is also a cat in Egyptian, and “one of the manifestations of the Sun God Ra.” The Mau character is like Groot from the MCU: he only says ‘I am Groot’. Mau only says ‘mau’, but Atreus seems to understand what he means. Check out the conversations below: </p>



<h4 id="h-athena-cutscene">Athena Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>To lefkó fídi tha se fáei</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Robed Figure: “<strong><em>One failed us. One rejected us</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Athena: “<strong><em>We have a problem</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-atreus-and-mau-cutscene">Atreus and Mau Cutscene: </h4>



<ul>
<li>Atreus: “<em><strong>Wake up. I think we’re close</strong></em>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau?</em></strong>“</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>Hey, you insisted on coming along. C’mon, let’s have a look</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Mau: “<strong><em>Mau</em></strong>.”</li>



<li>Atreus: “<strong><em>I hope you’re right. Sounds like we found it</em></strong>.”</li>
</ul>







<p>Readers should take this information with a grain of salt and wait for official confirmation from Santa Monica to know for sure. </p>

Embark are continuing their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-takes-a-turn-for-the-long-dark-with-todays-cold-snap-update-beware-the-frostbite">meteorological experiments</a> in extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> with a  rousing injection of wind. There’s a hurricane coming to the game on February 24th, a new map condition that limits visibility, degrades shields, impedes movement, and makes you suck even more at shooting things. Still, this stormcloud has a few silver linings. With the gale at your back, you’ll naturally move a lot faster. Also, you may find it easier to avoid detection in the open if you disable your shield.

“The wind will change how you navigate topside,” explains <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">an official site post</a>. “When you have a tailwind, you’ll feel fast and nimble, but fighting against the gales will inhibit your speed and quickly drain your stamina. Throwables will also behave differently in these conditions, and it may take a while to master the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Other aspects of gameplay like smoke, gas, and even jumping will be affected by the power of the Hurricane.”
</p>
<p>
The howling boreads will also steadily erode your shield, causing it to glitch and spark. This will make you more visible to other raiders through the murk, so you might want to turn it off. The steady mithering of the elements will also make it harder to see and hear Arc robots. It’s not entirely clear from the blog post if the likes of Wasps and Hornets will be whirled off course by the hurricane. Perhaps if we could work out the wind direction, we could set up a big net to catch them and then grenade them all in one go.
</p>
<p>
As ever with map-wide afflictions in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, peril brings plunder. The storm will reveal new caches of gear. Baby wanna new powercell? Out you go into the squall, then.
</p>
<p>
Off the top of my head, the only thing the Arc Raiders hurricane is missing is the opportunity to get lifted clean away Dorothy-style and land in a different map, perhaps even a different game. Picture a bunch of sky-tossed Raiders touching down on the sun-kissed isles of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, headshotting Tom Nook and stripping his cottage for parts. If you find Embark's approach to live service updates too turbulent, I'm sorry to say that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-like-how-often-map-conditions-rotate-in-arc-raiders-sorry-but-the-devs-say-that-most-likely-wont-change">the studio have no plans to change how they rotate the map conditions</a>.

<p>Shrouded Sky is bringing a lot of new content to ARC Raiders, but one of the highlights is undoubtedly the Hurricane map Condition. These are a key part of what keeps ARC Raiders feeling fresh and exciting, as some of them can fundamentally change how a map is played. </p>







<p>Some of the Map Conditions can be minor, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a>, but it seems like the Hurricanes are set to make some big changes when they roll through the maps. If you’re wondering what’s on the way with the Hurricanes, as well as what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> maps they’re playable on, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-maps-are-hurricanes-on-in-arc-raiders">What Maps Are Hurricanes On In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t get swept away! Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, it hasn’t been officially announced which maps the new Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, but the teaser trailer provides a few clues.</strong></p>



<p>During the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" id="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a>, the iconic Spaceport tower is clearly visible, indicating that the Hurricane will be playable on that map, but the rest of the footage is notably dark and unclear. Whilst that might replicate the visibility issues during the Hurricane, it makes it harder to figure out what maps are being played on. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders Shrouded Sky Release Date &amp; Start Times—All Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, from what little can be seen, it appears that Dam Battlegrounds will be another playable map that features the new Map Condition, and maybe even The Blue Gate. They seem to be safe guesses, as both maps feature prominent overground areas, and a Hurricane hitting Buried City might be thematically inappropriate, whilst Stella Montis would simply be unfeasible.</p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark Studios</a> officially reveals which maps the Hurricane Map Condition will be playable on, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with more certain clarity.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Time to extract? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Hurricane Map Condition will make numerous changes to ARC Raiders, with the key ones being impacted visibility and flying debris that can damage shields. </strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/">ARC Raiders Event Tracker—Every Map Condition Schedule</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s every change coming to ARC Raiders during the Hurricane Map Condition:</p>







<h3 id="h-wind">Wind</h3>



<p>Perhaps the most prominent feature of the Hurricane Map Condition is that raiders will have to battle unrelenting winds as they explore topside. They’re not just for show, however, as they’ll directly hinder movement and the trajectory of thrown items like grenades. Even smoke, gas, and jumping will be impacted by the Hurricane, so it’s important to plan your movements carefully.</p>



<h3 id="h-debris">Debris</h3>



<p>The winds don’t just impact raiders, though, as they’ll also kick up debris from the surface, which spells bad news for your shield. When hit by debris, your shield will glitch and degrade, both making you more visible to other raiders and lowering your chances of surviving many gunfights. It seems that when navigating the Hurricanes, it might be best to take off your shield, though you’ll be far more susceptible to a raider ambush.</p>



<h3 id="h-visibility">Visibility</h3>



<p>Clouds hang low during the Hurricanes, making topside almost unrecognisable. Vision will be limited, as will be your hearing, thanks to the howls of the winds. However, it doesn’t have to be all bad news, as you’re more than welcome to use it to your advantage too—just don’t walk headfirst into an obscured ARC.</p>



<h3 id="h-first-wave-caches">First Wave Caches</h3>



<p>Everyone’s always on the lookout for loot in ARC Raiders, and it looks like the Hurricanes will unearth some forgotten treasures. First Wave Caches can be found during the Hurricanes, as these First Wave relics have resurfaced due to the powerful winds. It seems like good loot can be found in these, so it might be worth weathering the storm after all. </p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem copies are in the wild, and Capcom has now promised to take action against the people posting any gameplay videos. </p>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is one of the developer’s biggest releases of the year, and they are committed to preserving the experience for fans. While <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-have-3-playable-characters-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaks</a> prior to official reveals and announcements typically reveal only limited details about the game, the physical copies being shared earlier are spoiling content for players.</p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers-are-already-online">Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers Are Already Online</h2>



<p>Capcom released a new statement on the BIO_OFFICIAL <a href="https://x.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024787173917249896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) regarding actions against individuals who spoil content from Resident Evil Requiem. The developers acknowledged that a significant number of gameplay videos have surfaced, which they believe were obtained illegally. They have requested that players who have access to the content or the game refrain from posting it online.</p>



<p>The developers have stated that posting these videos is not only a copyright infringement but also an offense against their customers. As a result, they will take firm action, such as deleting these videos and issuing warnings to users who engage in this activity. The developers aim to deliver a story that intertwines mystery and tension, providing a thrilling gaming experience that challenges players with unknown threats. They don’t want this experience to be spoiled for their audience.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both.

</p></div>
<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve had a great week of gaming this week. I’ve just really enjoyed myself, and a lot of that seems to come down to my returning addiction to Overwatch. The community has blossomed with the introduction of the five new characters, and everything feels somehow fresh and new, while also being reassuringly locked down. I know I enjoyed my time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard</a>, but, with limited competitive gaming time, it’s got to be Overwatch for me. I, perhaps, shouldn’t still be playing it at 1AM, but, what are you going to do? Sleep?</p>
<p>Jason has been playing Skyrim, which he’s playing with mods for the first time. He says, “I’m enjoying the mix of nostalgia and cool new spells a lot. I’ve also been playing more Lort, which is an excellent roguelike which might have broken the balance with the latest character, but I’m not complaining.”</p>

<p>Aran finished The Man Who Erased His Name, which he says, “Was a great Yakuza spin-off. I enjoyed playing as Kiryu and wandering around Osaka playing through a standard over the top Yakuza storyline. The ending was great and very emotional.</p>
<p>Gamoc has been played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/17/styx-blades-of-greed-review/">Styx</a> for review. He also started NG+ in Spidey 2 since it’s on PS+, while also starting Phantom Doctrine, “Because it was £1-odd on Switch.”</p>

<p>Jim has been glued to Red Dead Redemption all week, again. He said, “For the past several hours, I’ve been roaming Mexico, crossing off side quests and challenges before heading back up north. I remember finding this middle act fairly boring during my initial playthrough many years ago though now I have a much greater appreciation for it and clever shift in tone/setting. I’m unsure whether I’ll go for the platinum trophy though I intend to at least finish the main story and Undead Nightmares.”</p>
<p>Laura has been trying out Planet of Lana 2 for review this week – she says, “So far I’ve “squee-ed” (I’m pretty sure that’s a word) at least nine times at how adorable Mui is and “flargh-ed” (yep, that’s a word too) several times at how perfectly tricky the puzzles are! I’ve also been enjoying all the new updated content and improvements to Absolum with Ade – it’s now even better than before!”</p>

<p>Ade confirmed, “Oh yes! Let me tell you, the Absolum devs have clearly been working hard post-launch and have now fixed all of the roguelike related issues I brought up in my review. As a result, Absolum is now more than likely the best side-scrolling beat ’em up I’ve ever played!”</p>
<p>Steve has been writing a heck of a lot this week, while also fitting in some of his own gaming too. He said, ” I managed to spend some quality time playing through Lost Records: Bloom and Rage in an effort to clear some space on my PS5 for a big download which I ended up installing on PC instead. That big download is my current play but I am not allowed to speak of it. I also made a start on Son of Sparta, which is&nbsp; a perfectly solid search adventure game but hasn’t really got going yet. Aesthetically, it reminds me of a dialled-down Prince of Persia but doesn’t have the fluidity or innovation (especially the map screenshot feature) of Ubi’s most recent iteration. Whilst commuting, I enjoyed finishing Gumball in Trick or Treat Land, a modern GBC JRPG that I’ll have the review up for soon.”</p>
<p>Tef has swanned off to Munich to check out the latest updates to Rennsport, though he’s also spent a lot of this week squinting into the Nintendo Virtual Boy. Fancy!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

This wouldn't be the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">first time</strong> something like this happens: Ragnarok's beginning was also hidden inside the files of 2018's God of War.</p>



<p><em>"A hidden cutscene with what I think are beings from the higher plane and Athena talking about Odin and Atreus. There is also another character called 'Robed Figure', who says 'To lefkó fídi tha se fáei.' Greek for 'The white snake will eat you.'

<p><em>"One failed us.

<p>As the next God of War game has yet to be officially announced and is likely still a few years away, there's no way to know if these <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">newly discovered cutscenes</strong> will indeed be the basis of the next <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em></strong>.

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>

<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is tough without the right starting words or hints. February 20, 2026, Quordle is the #1488 edition of the puzzle, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to help you solve all four words.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-quordle-daily-game">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 20.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>
