<p>When Ubisoft announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was canceled</a>, it was also revealed that five other games were ending. Insider Gaming has learned the six games that have been cancelled at Ubisoft.</p>



<p>First reported on Insider Gaming Weekly, Insider Gaming understands that the following six games were canceled:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</strong> – Canceled after being first announced in 2020.</li>



<li><strong>Project Ether</strong> – In development since 2019, which was canceled, but has morphed, in a way, into a newer project. Believed to have been in development at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" id="168333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Project Pathfinder </strong>– Known previously as Project U</li>



<li><strong>Project Crest</strong> – A World War 2 extraction shooter</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</strong> – Stopping support</li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Singularity </strong>– A new mobile Assassin’s Creed Game</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with the game cancellations that were previously announced—confirmed above—there was also a multiplayer Assassin’s Creed that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-an-assassins-creed-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly been shuttered</a>. That game, however, isn’t a part of this group. </p>



<p>One game that is still coming is the Assassin’s Creed: Blag Flag Remake. The latest rumors suggest that a reveal will take place in April after being delayed out of the current physical year. </p>

            <guid>1435861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Seven years ago, this would have been my weekly recommendation of what to play – after all, I did put over 1,000 hours into the original Overwatch – but if you told me coming into 2026 that I'd be back into it, I would have laughed at you. But here we are; Overwatch's recent complete overhaul, which saw the game stripped of the "2" in its title, made me curious enough to jump back in. As a regular player from 2016 to 2019, Overwatch sits near the top of my personal favorite games of all time, but following the announcement of Overwatch 2 back in 2019, the title fell off hard. Content slowed to a drip as the team focused on Overwatch 2's story content, most of which never saw the light of day. Then, when Overwatch 2 arrived, I still enjoyed it (I <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/overwatch-2/a-heroic-return">gave it an 9 out of 10</a>, after all), but it was a far cry from the novelty and excitement surrounding the original game during those first several years.</p><p>This reworking of the entire game is so much more than just a simple title rebrand; in addition to a more prominent story, complete with Blizzard's famously great cinematics, it's also refocusing on what players love. A permanent 6v6 mode is there for those who favor the original Overwatch team compositions. A ton of new heroes are joining the roster this year (including five heroes just this week), completely flipping any existing Meta on its head. And speaking of Meta, the new Conquest Meta Event has you pick a faction and fight for it over the course of a five-week event, earning rewards every step of the way. As someone who hasn't played the game for several years now, I'm struggling to not only rewire my rusty muscle memory, but also relearn my favorite heroes, as many of them have received reworks in my absence. It's a little overwhelming, and many of my old strategies now fail, but I'm having a blast dipping my toe back in. And when I am able to go on a run as one of my old favorites, I'm reminded precisely why I fell in love with this game in the first place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2026/02/13/the-video-games-you-should-play-this-weekend-february-13]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-devs-know-safeguard-has-problems-and-are-looking-into-it-2000668703</link>
            <guid>1435834</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over a decade ago, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em> introduced a new multiplayer game mode to the franchise: <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Safeguard_(game_mode)">Safeguard</a>. This team-based mode had players pushing and defending a walking robot from another team tasked with stopping it. It was very good. But the mode’s last appearance in a main game was in 2018. So I was over the moon to see the mode return as part of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s second season. And while I have some issues with it, Safeguard is still a lot of fun in 2026.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Booting up Safeguard in the new season of <em>COD: BLOPS7</em></a> was like returning to an old friend’s house after years away to hang out. Something I’ve always appreciated about the mode was how it gave the defense a way to fight back that wasn’t just “Kill the other team.” You can instead focus your damage on the robot, and if you do enough, it will stop moving and have to reboot. This gives less skilled players a way to help without having to hunt down highly skilled <em>COD</em> pros each match. It also leads to an interesting dynamic where a defending team can over-focus on taking out the bot and let the attackers flank them and wipe them out. But focus too much on the attackers, and the bot will walk its way into the checkpoint, and you’ll lose before you realize it.</p>

  <p>This time around, the robot you are defending is a four-legged Boston Dynamics-like mechanical dog. The bots were previously bipedal humanoids, which was fine, but I’m far more into guarding a robo dog than a random mechanical man. But it felt to me as if this robot dog might be moving faster than the past bots had in Safeguard. So I talked to the devs behind the mode, and they confirmed that, no, the bot is moving at a “pace consistent with previous” versions of Safeguard.</p> <p>However, “<em>BO7</em>’s tighter map layouts, updated pathing, and the new animation set can make its movement feel faster, even though the underlying speed hasn’t changed much,” said a Treyarch spokesperson. They also confirmed they are looking at data to decide if the bot should move a bit slower.</p>

 <p>Another issue with the current version of Safeguard in <em>Black Ops 7</em> is that you can sometimes win, but still lose. Basically, the game mode is built around how fast you get the bot to the checkpoint. Each team gets a shot at pulling this off. If the first team does it in let’s say two minutes, then the other team goes, and if they get the bot there in two minutes and three seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LegP5qViODY">they’ll lose despite the bot making it to the checkpoint</a>. This feels bad, and Treyarch tells me they are looking into this.</p>

 <p>“We’re evaluating options to end the second round early in situations where the attacking team hasn’t pushed the Robot far enough in time,” Treyarch told <em>Kotaku</em>. “And we’re looking at this alongside the broader UI improvements already in progress. Our goal is to make the rules and win conditions as clear and intuitive as possible for all players.” The team is also open to bringing back overtime, which isn’t included in Safeguard right now.</p> <p>Besides those issues, and an odd bug that let people knock the bot out with a combat axe that has already been patched, I’ve really enjoyed playing Safeguard again. I think it’s a great example of how <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s gunplay can be incredibly successful in modes that aren’t simply about killing each other.</p>

 <p>I hope the mode sticks around past season two and, like Kill Confirmed and other fan favorites, return in future <em>Call of Duty</em> games. You don’t even have to have a robot for this mode to work. If the next <em>Call of Duty</em> isn’t set in the future but instead WW2 or something, fine, use a jeep. That would still let me enjoy this mode with my friends, even those who aren’t great at FPS games.</p>

<p>Rovio's performance "fell significantly short of initial forecast"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8a7a553b8c1b"><a title="Sonic Angry Birds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8a7a553b8c1b/sonic-angry-birds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>SEGA Sammy has published its <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_q3_presentation_e.pdf">Q3 2025/26 financial report</a>, and it's a pretty mixed bag for the multimedia giant, with losses reported in multiple different areas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest piece of news comes from Rovio's side of the business. Sega acquired the Angry Bird developer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/its-official-sega-is-buying-angry-birds-maker-rovio">in 2023</a> Sega reports has fallen "significantly short of initial forecast due to rapid changes in the market environment and other factors".</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20260213_forecast_e.pdf">reported an impairment loss</a> of ¥30.4 billion ($198.6 million), citing increased competition and the rapid deterioration of user bases. This meant that "Rovio found it difficult to advance its initially planned business development".</p>
<p>A number of titles haven't met Sega's own internal targets, with development delays and cancellations also a factor. <strong>Sonic Rumble</strong>, the mobile game which Rovio co-developed, also fell short of expectations, particularly around customer acquisition.</p>
<p>It's not just with Rovio, though — while net sales remain steady and are 4% up year-on-year, operating income and ordinary income are both down, 54.6% and 51.8% respectively. Entertainment Contents has also dropped 31%.</p>
<p>Sega only reports two full game releases for the third quarter: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> on Switch 2, and <strong>Football Manager 26</strong>, the latter of which needed "a series of updates to address post-launch bugs, etc. and improved the gameplay environment". And in general, full game titles have reported "stagnant growth".</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though: Sega is planning to release "four major new titles for mainstay IPs" next financial year, with a continued focus on expanding the trans-media business (movies, TV shows, merch, etc.). Daniel Svärd, once King's head of live game studios, will be appointed as Rovio's COO.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great showing for the company, and Sega has revised its net sales expectations to rise slightly — ¥490 billion / $3.2 billion, up from ¥475 billion / $3.1 billion — while operating income expectations have been lowered to ¥40 billion / $261.5 million, from ¥53 billion / $346.6 million.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> has <em>just</em> launched, and that will be included in the final report for the fiscal year ending March 2026. So that may help turn the tides a little. And 2026 marks the 35th anniversary for the Sonic series, so the future should be blue — in a good way.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/valve-adds-ability-attack-pc-specs-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1435807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that user-submitted <strong>Steam Reviews</strong> have often been <strong>quite controversial</strong>, especially during so-called "<strong>review bombings</strong>". In these instances, specific games have been targeted with a deluge of negative reviews, thus <strong>crashing the overall user review score</strong> on Valve's platform.</p>



<p>One of the earliest scenarios was the review bombing of <strong>Firewatch</strong>, <strong>Campo Santo</strong>'s acclaimed adventure game released in 2016. The following year, YouTuber <strong>PewDiePie</strong> <strong>racially insulted a player</strong> during a livestream in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (<strong>PUBG</strong>), and Campo Santo's founder <strong>Sean Vanaman</strong> asked YouTube to remove all of PewDiePie's videos from the platform. However, in retaliation, PewDiePie's legion of followers went en masse on Steam to <a href="https://wccftech.com/firewatch-negative-reviews-pewdiepie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leave negative reviews on Firewatch</a>.</p>



<p>Just a week after the controversy, Valve <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-histograms-help-review-bombing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added histograms to user-submitted Steam Reviews</a> to help them make sense of these situations. However, review bombings continued:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2018, SEGA's <strong>Total War: Rome II</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/tw-rome-ii-review-bombed-female-generals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got review bombed</a> <strong>due to the presence in the game of too many female generals</strong></li>



<li>In 2020, CAPCOM's <strong>Monster Hunter World</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-world-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-due-to-racist-joke-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a temporary blast of negative reviews</a> from Chinese players following what they perceived to be <strong>a racist joke in the Monster Hunter movie</strong></li>



<li>In 2023, Blizzard's <strong>Diablo IV</strong> was <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-is-already-being-review-bombed-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately review bombed when it launched on Steam</a>, with many user reviews blatantly criticizing the studio <strong>without even touching the game's actual content</strong></li>



<li>In 2024, Sony Santa Monica's <strong>God of War: Ragnarök</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-review-bombed-on-steam-amid-the-psn-linking-requirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was briefly the target of a review bombing</a> when Sony still required users to register for a PlayStation account to play single player games</li>
</ul>



<p>That said, in some instances, negative Steam reviews <strong>can be helpful to the developer if they point out actual problems with the game</strong>. One such scenario is whenever there are performance issues. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">With the latest Steam Client Beta</a>, Valve has introduced the "<strong>option to attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page</strong>", which could be really useful for developers as they diagnose performance problems mentioned in their game's Steam reviews. </p>



<p>The new Steam Client Beta also introduced another option: to send "<strong>anonymized frame rate data</strong>" to Valve. This data will be stored "without connection to your Steam account, but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on." Valve claims <strong>it will help them improve Steam and overall game compatibility</strong>, with a focus on devices running <strong>SteamOS</strong>.</p>

              <p><span>Cool stuff is always coming out of the alternative controller community. From rhythm games where you wiggle around on </span><a href="https://scrape.nugget.fun/"><span>a real skateboard</span></a><span> to games where you smack </span><a href="https://www.dachu-interactive.com/how-to-pet-your-cat"><span>a giant stuffed animal cat butt</span></a><span>, the world of weird controllers is awesome and underrated. Luckily, a brand new type of alt control is getting some well-deserved love.</span></p> <p><span>Streamer Perri Karyal is </span><a href="https://youtu.be/rIbfNUA5pWk?si=ZHmAQQDUcdhWQfk2"><span>known</span></a><span> for making alt controls that allow her to play games using her brain—but what if it were the other way around? What if a game could control a player?</span></p> <p><span>On Thursday, Karyal </span><a href="https://x.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?s=20"><span>posted</span></a><span> a video showing off exactly that. Using a process called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which basically sends signals to the part of your ear canal that’s responsible for your sense of balance, Karyal was able to hook up her own body to a controller.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can control your balance</p> <p>I made a device that sends DC current through my head to stimulate my vestibular nerve (called galvanic vestibular stimulation or GVS) and, in doing so, can make me feel completely destabilised. By changing the direction of the current, it can make me… <a href="https://t.co/XNH0EtRow6">pic.twitter.com/XNH0EtRow6</a></p> <p>— Perri (@perrikaryal) <a href="https://twitter.com/perrikaryal/status/2022045170154328538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“By changing the direction of the current, it can make me fall in that direction,” she explains. The video shows Karyal running in a straight line — until a person shifts a joystick to the left, which causes her to veer to the left, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Karyal proceeded to use the tech to simulate G forces while playing Ubisoft’s 2020 racing game </span><i><span>Trackmania.</span></i><span> In the video, she sways from side to side in tandem with her digital car, to dizzying effect. She also reports seeing “flashing lights,” which doesn’t sound too good. The official </span><i><span>Trackmania</span></i><span> Esports account </span><a href="https://x.com/TMesports/status/2022169923741741070?s=20"><span>took notice</span></a><span> of Karyal’s experiment, calling it “awesome.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The technology that makes this possible is actually quite old. In an NBC article from 2005, journalist Yuri Kageyama </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna9816703"><span>tries out GVS</span></a><span>: “I found the experience unnerving and exhausting: I sought to step straight ahead but kept careening from side to side. Those alternating currents literally threw me off.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perri Karyal stresses not to replicate this experiment at home, as GVS isn’t very well-researched and can cause adverse effects. It’s very cool to watch someone else do it, though!</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After some teasing last week, Stern Pinball has officially unveiled its pricey <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-firered-leafgreen-switch-2-port-eshop-online-2000668213"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-themed tables with a snazzy trailer. The question now is: Are you willing to pay $7,000 to fling steel balls at Meowth’s face?</p> <p>On February 13, Stern Pinball released a new trailer showing off its $7,000 <em>Pokémon</em> table, which features a large HD screen that plays clips from the anime series as well as a highly interactive playfield that includes a moving Pikachu and a Meowth balloon. Here’s the video:</p>  <p>Stern says players will be able to capture Pokémon while playing this pinball machine. And if you have a Stern account and log in via the app while playing, you’ll be able to collect Pokémon and check them out later on the app. As you’d expect from a modern pinball machine, the playfield is jam-packed with spinners, ramps, and targets to hit, all of which will cause Pikachu to react to how you’re playing.</p>

 <p>“Today we’re proud to finally deliver the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> by Stern Pinball machine,” <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">said Stern Pinball president</a> and CEO Seth Davis in a press release. “This game is a true celebration of nostalgia, craftsmanship, and the enduring adventure of Pokémon – brought to life in a whole new way through immersive pinball gameplay, thrilling battles, and the timeless excitement of catching <em>Pokémon</em>.”</p> <p>This all sounds cool, and if you find one at your local arcade or bar, it will likely be a lot of fun. However, if you want to buy one of these machines to stick in your basement or gaming room, you’ll need to drop at least $7,000 on the base model. There’s also a premium model that features different artwork, enhanced audio and visuals, and a fancier backglass, among other bonuses. Those don’t come cheap. This upgraded version will cost $9,700. Meanwhile, a limited-edition version of the table will set you back $13,000!</p>

 <p>If you can afford to grab this <em>Pokémon</em> table, first off, congrats on doing well in life. <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/pokemon/">And also, Stern is taking orders for its newly revealed <em>Pokémon</em> pinball machine right now on its website.</a></p>

            <guid>1435747</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Highguard </strong>is the latest free-to-play first-person shooter to hit the market, and if things keep going the way they are now, it'll also be the latest free-to-play first-person shooter that was shut down after being unable to break through as a massive hit right at launch. After its trailer at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards</a></strong> failed to land with players, and the weeks of silence that followed did nothing to help, when it arrived, before players even made it through the tutorial, <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">they were leaving negative reviews</a> on Steam.</p>



<p>Even though it had over <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K</strong> concurrent players</a> on Steam when it launched, those numbers quickly dwindled, and now, barely two weeks after it launched, developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> confirmed that it had laid off several members of its staff, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">those impacted confirming that "<em>most</em>" of the studio had been cut.</a></p>



<p>One of those impacted developers, <strong>Josh Sobel</strong>, a technical artist who worked on Highguard, took to X (formerly Twitter) to write an extended reflection on how the game's launch went, what happened, and how he and several of his former colleagues are now out of a job and back looking for work in this volatile market.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After starting by discussing just how much everyone at the studio believed in the game, and how high its praise was from internal feedback, Sobel began digging into when things turned sour.</p>



<p>"<em>But then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there</em>," Sobel begins. "<em>Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they’ve got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel went on to discuss how he and some of his colleagues were directly targeted after making celebratory posts about the game's reveal and its subsequent launch, with a slew of hate and vitriol sent towards them. </p>



<p>"<em>They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be 'woke trash.'"</em></p>



<p>On the topic of the game's poor marketing in its lead-up to launch, Sobel didn't directly comment because he felt it was not his place. He also made the point that we can never know if Highguard would have been received the same way, or more positively, if it hadn't gone ahead with its Game Awards trailer, or even if it had submitted a different trailer to the show. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It should be noted that not long after user reviews on Steam began piling in, Wildlight's chief executive officer, <strong>Dusty Welch</strong>, apologized for the game's marketing up to that point and took responsibility for its "<em>poor</em>" trailer at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better. Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback</em>," Welch said in an interview. "<em>I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think The Game Awards was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient.</em>"</p>



<p>Sobel continued, digging into how the public's response to Highguard was to judge it before they had even touched it. "<em><strong>We were turned into a joke from minute one</strong>, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival,</strong> and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and 'Titanfall 3 died for this.' </em><strong><em>At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial.</em>"</strong></p>



<p>Sobel does add that Highguard's current state is not fully the fault of the players who decided the game sucked before giving it a shot, or the subsection of the content creator economy that has been built off of negative content. But he does say that it played a role.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. <strong>All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Sobel concluded by remarking that if we keep seeing new multiplayer games get beaten out of the space by pre-conceived notions based on a bad trailer, we'll stop seeing new multiplayer projects like Highguard even get their chance. Developers will stop taking the chance on a new upstart studio looking to try something new in the triple-A space, because it's too much of a risk to put their livelihoods on the line. "<em><strong>Innovation is on life support</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Even if Highguard had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight…deserved better than this. <strong>We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>Nothing is going to stop players from making snap decisions based on a trailer. If a game doesn't resonate with them in an instant, many are quick to categorize their feelings for that game as negative and move on, sticking with what they already know. Especially when it comes to free-to-play games, where it's understood that these games don't just want your money for cosmetics, they want to consume as much of your gaming time as possible.</p>



<p>It's up to developers to catch your eye and convince you that their game is worth investing that kind of time in. But it's also fair to say that leaving a negative review before you've finished the tutorial should not be a weight placed on any game. You might have made up your mind about the game in seconds, but that doesn't mean you can speak on its quality with any real authority. No one would pay someone any attention if they tried calling themselves a 'critic' or 'reviewer' after only playing five minutes of a game.</p>



<p>But even if Highguard didn't get lambasted with negative reviews right off the jump, it's difficult to say that it would have found success. For as big as free-to-play live service shooters are, there's a great deal of fatigue players are feeling around these games, and ones trying to enter the genre are facing the brunt of that fatigue.</p>



<p>We'll never be able to pin down one single reason Highguard's launch has gone this way, but Sobel's comments do provide insight into how developers see these launches play out from their end, and how hurtful it is to see people decide they've failed before they even started.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maestro Media has announced an official card game based on James Cameron's<em> Avatar</em>. The new game, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>, pits players in a fast-paced battle for control of the alien world of Pandora.</p><h2>The <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> Card Game Announcement</h2><p>According to a report <a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/61628/maestro-media-licenses-avatar-new-tabletop-game" rel="nofollow">by ICV2</a>, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is an asymmetric card game designed for two players. Players take on the role of either the RDA or a faction of Na'Vi as they battle across various locations on Pandora. The core gameplay isn't a deckbuilding experience but lane-battling, similar to a MOBA. The first person to reach 30 points is declared the winner.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-fire-and-ash-film-photo.jpg?itok=SDT80Sh3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="750" height="421">

  </picture><p>Maestro Media's CEO Javon Frazier explained the more asymmetric elements of the card game.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>"The RDA and the Na’vi do not play the same game, and they should not. One side is focused, aggressive, and extractive. The other is adaptive, interconnected, and rooted in the land. The asymmetry is the experience. Every match becomes a tense, strategic story about control, resistance, and what it means to fight for a world worth protecting.”</p></blockquote><p><em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is the latest Maestro Media project adapting popular and beloved media properties. Their past work includes the Kickstarter campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-afternoon-rewind-kickstarter-campaign-blows-up-with-millennial-nostalgia" rel="nofollow"><em>Disney Afternoon Rewind Collection</em></a>, a board game adaptation of the mobile title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/maestro-media-announces-clash-of-clans-epic-raid-board-game-based-on-hit-mobile-game" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Stanley Kubrick film, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2001-space-odyssey-board-game-tasks-you-with-outsmarting-hal-9000" rel="nofollow"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></a>, and a board game based on <em>The Smurfs</em>.</p><p>Curiously, <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em> is one of few board game adaptations of James Cameron's blockbuster films. Despite spanning three feature films dating back to 2009, Avatar has very little multimedia presence outside of a few tie-in comics. The last board game release was <em>Avatar: The Board Game</em> released by Mega Games in 2010, which currently sits at 4.8/10 on Board Game Geek.</p><p>At the time of writing, there is no release date or MSRP for <em>Avatar: Pandora's Power</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the new tactical RPG roguelike about cat breeding, has come under a bit of fire during its launch week for its long list of voice cameos. Among </span><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/252481/mewgenics/credits/windows/"><span>the eclectic group</span></a><span> of people who do the various “meow”s in the game are a fair number of content creators, including husband-and-wife podcast hosts Ethan and Hila Klein, both of whom have expressed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qidsNawR9TE"><span>pro-Israel views in regards to its ongoing conflict with Palestine</span></a><span>. Hila was born in Israel and was required by law to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytOl5hbTrCY"><span>serve in the Israel Defense Forces at 18,</span></a><span> albeit not in a combat role. After some criticism of their presence in the game on social media, the developers have responded.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate"><i><span>Rock Paper Shotgun</span></i></a><span>, developer Edmund McMillen explained that the giant list of meowers was accumulated over several years, with Ethan Klein’s contribution coming together four years before the game launched.</span></p> <p><span>“I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games,” McMillen told </span><i><span>RPS</span></i><span>. “As some probably noticed I was [pretty] all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This counterbalancing, as McMillen calls it, means recruiting people with different views, such as iDubbbz and Anisa Jombha, who have </span><a href="https://x.com/overzealots_/status/2018074085964575102"><span>publicly supported Palestine</span></a><span>, to balance out people like Klein. iDubbbz and Klein have been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyB85pVw-v4"><span>publicly feuding</span></a><span> after the former released a video criticizing the latter’s stance on Israel. McMillen says he contacted both parties before </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ launch to make sure they knew the other would be in the game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now that </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mewgenics-has-some-problematic-meows-ethan-klein-hila-klein.1431916/"><span>gotten pushback for including Klein</span></a><span>, he says it’s “sad” that some might be “</span><span>so put off by the idea of an inclusion of someone they don’t like so much that they will never play the game,”</span><span> though he doesn’t engage with the fact that at the heart of this disagreement is a literal genocide.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial…” McMillen said, “but it felt interesting so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>McMillen says that someone who was bothered by a “problematic meow” would probably not enjoy </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>anyway, though he says that if you do still play the game, you can simply throw any offending cat in the trash and go about your way. </span></p>

<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Warhorse Studios has surprise-dropped a free <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> update on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S that brings the game up to Ultra Quality-like PC visuals on consoles. That includes 60 FPS performance, 4K resolution upscaling, improved textures and assets, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Out now, this update is free to all existing owners of Kingdom Come: Deliverance on PlayStation and Xbox, and if you don't already own the game, you can pick it up on digital storefronts for $29.99. In a new "Next-Gen Update" trailer highlighting the game's PS5 and Xbox Series X/S enhancements, Warhorse reveals Kingdom Come: Deliverance has surpassed 10 million copies sold, which is more than double the 4 million copies sold of its sequel, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/best-of-2025/2025/12/16/editor-top-10s-of-2025">which was my Number Two game of the year in 2025</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gLXjKFYQg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_gLXjKFYQg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>My Quick Kingdom Come: Deliverance Next-Gen Update Impressions</h3><p>As you can see, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is looking better than ever. I adored Kingdom Come: Deliverance II last year, but I had actually never played its predecessor. With how much I enjoyed Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, I'm happy to report that in my early hours with this updated version of the first game, I'm having a great time. Something I especially appreciate is that Warhorse seemingly held great restraint when essentially remastering this game – it looks very much like the original release, but is just a bit easier on the eyes. The artistic vision of that first game remains intact, and based on comparisons I've been seeing, there aren't any major changes that disrespect what the original developers accomplished more than half a decade ago.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, that is an ideal enhancement update: make it run better, increase the resolution, and lightly touch up the other areas of the game. It's okay if that knight still kind of looks a little wonky – it's the knight your original players of the 2018 came to enjoy seeing on their screen, and I like that this update upholds that. Even the gameplay matches that of the original game, and while that's for the worse when compared to the across-the-board improvements made in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, it's nice to experience this game with a new coat of paint and come to understand the context in which its fans came to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>It's why, when I watched <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> for the first time in the late 2010s, I chose the original version– not <em>Kai</em>, which essentially trims the filler and remasters the visuals. <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>is a beloved anime, and I wanted to see it the way its long-time fans originally did; I appreciate Goku's adventures more because of that. I imagine I'm going to roll credits on Kingdom Come: Deliverance on my PS5, feeling the same.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read my <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/a-medieval-day-epic">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II review</a> to find out why it was one of my favorite games of 2025, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/kingdom_come_deliverance/b/xboxone/archive/2018/02/28/kingdom-come-deliverance-review-game-informer.aspx"><em>Game Informer's </em>review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> to learn what we thought of it in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about this update, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance/kingdom-come-deliverance-patch-197-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s">you can check out the full patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited to check out this update for Kingdom Come: Deliverance?
