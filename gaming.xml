			<p>Digital Extremes has revealed major <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulframe</a> news at TennoCon 2025. Preludes, the Pre-Alpha version of the game, will be opened to public access for everyone who signs up <a href="http://www.soulframe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> by July 20 at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. They'll continue to have access until the game's full public launch. After the open sign-up period ends, players can still sign up but will be placed in a queue until additional access becomes available.</p>



<p>Geoff Crookes, Creative Director of Soulframe, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Over a year now of players going hands-on with Soulframe in our Preludes pre-alpha builds, we’ve learned so many lessons and built a lot of new features for us as a studio. After last TennoCon, we put a huge amount of effort into improving combat fluidity and continued that passionate work into exploring brand new features like player social hubs, asynchronous player messaging with World Trees, among so many other additions. Today, we shared what the latest additions to our next Preludes build would be and beyond. We promise to all existing and future players to keep trying new things outside our comfort zone and work with you to create something we’ve all been looking for.</em></p>



<p>Combat has been significantly improved since last year, with smoother and more grounded fights. Movement and stagger have been overhauled, and a new "Smite" critical hit that allows "soul stealing" from enemies has been implemented. Bows have been reworked as well, and a new "Combat Arts" system, where packs and weapons level up through combat to unlock unique arts, is being introduced. More weapons will be added, including a two-handed axe.</p>



<p>The gameplay demo from TennoCon 2025 also showed new content and features coming to Soulframe.  A new fable, "The She-Wolf Snared," which is Orgal's fable, has been added. Playing it allows players to get their own puppy. New time-based festivals, including the "Festival of the Circade" and "Akfolmar" (a spooky season event), have been introduced. Improvements have been made to the Sparrow's Tale system, an in-game mission system now tied to factions, offering greater variety in mission types. The new player experience has been improved, too, with the game now starting with a choice to pick an alignment (Spirit, Courage, or Grace), which is connected to one of three enclaves in their faction system (Alchemist's Children, Kith and Kin, and Silent Rose).</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Players will soon find a new enemy, the Wazzard of Wastes, who is the source of the rot in the heart of the Galvinar Swam. Furthermore, this magical mini-boss offered a new perspective on Magick-focused combat in Soulframe, showing off a new parry feature that can reflect projectiles back at the corrupt thaumaturge. After an initial tease, TennoCon 2025 attendees and viewers were even treated to the next Omen Beast boss fight: Bromius. Players will explore the underground realm of the Neath’uns, which is full of corrupted Sproutfolk and environmental puzzles that hinder the rehabilitation of the mutated, three-headed Bromius from the sinister whispers within the dark, tainted sap.</p>



<p>The Soulframe development team then showcased the first set of hairstyles available for players to customize their Envoy. Eight different hairstyle cosmetics are in production, and additional customizations for Envoys are still to come. More interestingly, the Soulframe team presented a customizable approach to combat techniques and skill progression that can be tailored to individual playstyle preferences. Offensive and defensive build options can be mixed and matched, including close-range melee focused on creating space with dodges and ranged damage that can close the gap with timed parries. Other combinations include more supportive roles. This progression approach allows players to tailor their Envoy's strengths to their preferred playstyle. It also adds to situational party compositions when playing cooperatively with others across various encounters.</p>

            <p>Fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> remains nestled away in its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-warframe-devs-want-you-to-come-try-their-luxurious-fantasy-action-rpg-soulframe">closed alpha form</a> as this year’s TennoCon arrives. Despite plans to open that beta’s doors to a bunch more folks over the course of this weekend, developers Digital Extremes are keen to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>'s cottagecore sibling closed off for at least a bit longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that they have a bunch of new stuff they’re planning to unleash into fantasy land soon, as they continue to build a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe">strong fairytale-infused foundation</a> for the tale of the natural world clashing with technologically-advanced invaders.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, if you've signed up for an account via <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/signup">Soulframe’s website</a> to this point or do during the course of this weekend, July 19th to 20th, you’ll be granted access to Soulframe’s Preludes alpha testing, joining the fair few folks already running around in there. Given that’s likely to drive a pretty sizeable expansion of the playerbase, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair was asked during a press preview attended by RPS whether it indicates an early access release might be coming soon.</p>
<p>“We have ambitions, we have a few things…about our progression systems that are not quite in yet. We’re not comfortable doing anything open until those systems are in,” he replied, “So, it’s a great opportunity to join us and help shape that future, but we still have a few things we need to get in before we’re comfortable even trying that.”</p>
<p>While they’re still playing a bit coy with regards to timings on Soulframe additions, the devs did show off a number of features that’ll be arriving in the game soon, with the biggest being a new quest in the form of the Waste Bear fable. This got a big demo playthrough as part of the game’s Tennocon 2025 showcase, and it’s all about you being enlisted by a witch who is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur</a> levels of French to investigate the plight of a three-headed bear omen spirit called Bromius, who's struggling to fulfil his duty of caring for the trees.</p>

<p>There’s outside pollution that’s affecting him, some little woodland fellas called Sproutfolk that you’ll have to battle to save them from the corruption, and a boss battle you’ll have to trek through a new dungeon called the Neath’uns to face. If you want to know more about how it came to be and why it features a mini-boss who is brilliantly named the Wazzard of Wastes, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-director-chats-wiz-versus-waz-and-a-demo-he-hopes-will-help-prove-its-not-just-a-soulslike">our pre-TennoCon interview with Soulframe director Geoff Crookes</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the devs also teased the mote system that’ll allow you to unleash weird little woodland creatures on your opponents, expanded character customisation via the means to change your hairstyle, and some medieval-style martial arts manuals being added into the progression system to teach you skills like parrying. Plus, the promise of more stuff to do down the line in the form of extra Sparrow’s Tales, fables, and ancestor ghost people to recruit to your home camp, the Nightfold.</p>
<p>It all looks pretty cool, though that might just be me being easily swayed by the fact the bear fable involves you fighting a Wazzard.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframes-getting-a-bear-quest-and-its-devs-want-you-to-keep-bearing-with-them-as-you-wait-for-it-to-emerge-from-alpha]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Soulframe is a free-to-play, open-world multiplayer RPG with a fantasy setting that sits in contrast to Warframe's sci-fi world. It’s much more rooted in a connection to nature, encouraging exploration of Midrath’s mystical wilderness. Instead of guns and lasers, think bows and magic.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're interested in trying the game for yourself, you can sign up right now on the Soulframe <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2QQfvF1_72cTWjozBDJbSrvJV_Nt-eZQ3-D_SvKgyLAS1b0gjmAFILXJPex6kUuka-j-ml9wMeC1paZGCHTEXX6NqVnpvHSwUtapNkrV9WkY7_Pa-XKCIlEUmps0Q_MJBe1ZqUVT08dSr3jVssyBRX5IJwR-aG3IDv4RLMZUGy2RpUEo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>. Digital Extremes is granting Soulframe Preludes access to all players who sign up during TennoCon weekend, <strong>before July 20 at 11:59 p.m. ET</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Earlier, Steve spoke about how skill trees felt "boring," and maybe not the right fit for Soulframe as a live service game, while showing off concept art of a new skill system. Can you speak a bit more about the new way of managing and obtaining skills, and how it works better for Soulframe? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Scott McGregor</strong>: If you're familiar with the early days of Warframe, we had a version of a skill tree. And we found it didn't work. And then, we repeated the same problem again [laughs]. And in Soulframe, we were attempting to try to tie it to… a broader category of weapons to sort of make that pace work with the length of the game that we're making. The games that we make, obviously, are thousands of hours. You know, we're getting players, hopefully, in for a long time, right? We have lots of players that have been with us on Warframe for the full 12 years.</p><p dir="ltr">And designing systems that can be interesting and deep enough for that amount of time is a challenge. So, obviously, seeing where we were on the skill trees, we felt, again, it wasn't going to work for us. So we're pivoting to a system that's more open-ended, and more something that you can add to quickly, and out of sync. Skill trees sort of suffer from this problem [where] you have to respect all the player's investment in it.</p><p dir="ltr">So, a player that has been with us for a very long time… if you add something cool and new to the game, they can get the thing that's at the very end of the tree, right? A new player that, you know, joined five years in, cannot. Or someone that just, you know, happened to watch a dev stream is like, "Oh, those new skills that you're adding to the game look really cool. I want to check out this game." And then they look at the skill tree and go, "Oh my God, this is thousands of hours just to get to the end where I can get this final new skill."</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas an open-ended system, where you can add things and take away as we develop them, allows new and old players to experience those things. So I think that is one of the reasons why we're doing this. It's like making a system that can grow with us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534957"></a><figcaption>The Envoy fighting a troubled Bromius.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534957-bromius-fight-6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: It's not 100% [one way or the other]. [Your] progression of the amount [of skills] that you can slot will be tied to the progression of the weapon category. So if you're using bows, you'll have like a bow skill ninja scroll type thing that you can slot in--different bow techniques and bow skills. And then, as you get better with more bows, you [will] have more slots to slot [skills] in. And then finding the individual skills will be based on what's in the world. Like you can find it from an ancestor, or pick up a rare one from a drop, or something like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>We met this French-speaking witch, Verminia--who I love by the way, because I speak French--and it was mentioned that language is important in Soulframe. Does language diversity tie into the narrative, or is it more of an overall vibe or feeling you were going for when expanding or fleshing out the world?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sydney Hills</strong>: Yeah, definitely a big part of the soul of Soulframe is the different languages and the different accents. We've worked with voice actors from tons of different places already. Kim Bonifay, who voices Verminia--she's French, [but] I think she's located in London, England. Also, for the Bromius quest, we got Øystein Kanestrøm, who is the voice of Bromius. And he is Finnish, recording from Finland.</p><p dir="ltr">I know in my writing, I source a lot of inspiration from historical languages and historical slang. For our last update, we got a bunch of Scottish voice actors in for all of these NPCs around Dendria, which is our pseudo-Scottish town. And I learned so much good Scottish slang and it was so much fun [to learn]. A lot of the time, I would come into the recording sessions with some Scottish slang in the script, and the Scottish actors would be like, "So does this mean he's drunk?" And I would be like, "Well, no, I thought that meant he was tired." They're like, "Nope, this means drunk." Every Scottish slang [term] means drunk if you really get to the bottom of it [laughs].</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534955" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534955"></a><figcaption>Bromius looking at an acorn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534955-bromius-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Anyways, tangent, but definitely in the Bromius quest too, we had a lot of influence from Finnish mythology [and] Finnish language. There's this word… a Finnish word, [and] it kind of means "tears of the deep forest spruce." And again, it's alcohol. It's another euphemism for moonshine.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: Oh, really?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Doing that sort of early language [research] definitely helps inspire a lot of the themes. It definitely helped inspire the Bromius quest. And, you know, what would a tree cry? It would be sap.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are some of the challenges you face when crafting a narrative for a live service game in these early stages, while players are still playing Preludes, and it's not, you know, fully open yet? How far ahead do you have to look and plan for a game that wants to grow year after year?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Narrative-wise, it's definitely a lot of guessing. There's a lot. There's some things that we know for sure. We have really big plot points surrounding some of our big villains and our big heroes, and people that we'll need to save. But a lot of it… comes up organically in writing weapon descriptions or location text in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a lot of, you know, very slow building, and every once in a while I'll insert another, "Okay, there's another place in this world called 'Skelflind.' And now that's a thing, and we can draw on it later. It's a lot of following threads of what we find interesting and hoping that they'll all fit together in the end.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That sounds really difficult, I'm not gonna lie [laughs].</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: There's a lot of planting seeds. You're leaving little nuggets of stuff that you're going to come back [to] years later and be like, "Oh, well, this is what I meant back then about that thing that I only mentioned in one sentence." But we expand that later. I always found that was super interesting about the Warframe development. Stuff that was, you know, vaguely referenced in very early lore, becomes this great big thing later on. And I think that was fantastic. And I think Soulframe will follow that same path.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534956" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534956"></a><figcaption>The Envoy exploring the woods.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534956-wavetwood-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: It's a different category. So, sidearms are our subsection of weapons that can only fit into that slot. I won't say that we won't allow you eventually to mix and match and put a sidearm into your main [slot] or your main into your sidearm [slot]. That could end up being a thing, but currently, right now, we have them in two [different] buckets.</p><p dir="ltr">But there will be different options in your sidearm. So you'll be able to get a magic casting wrist gauntlet for your sidearm. Or you'll be able to get a wrist-mounted bow. It isn't always just gonna be blades or maces, or stuff like that. There'll be a variety of weapons in both categories.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think community manager Sarah [Asselin] was talking about it, and she said that the sidearm is very distinctly not [a] secondary weapon.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: Yeah… I think Steve [Sinclair] is rubbing off on Sydney, too. They like to name things--give them names for Soulframe. Which, you know, makes my life difficult because I always stumble on these things when we're trying to talk about them in public. Because it's like, "It's your sidearm," [but no,] "It's your secondary."</p><p dir="ltr">I think that's what's great about the games that we do make is [that] we go that little bit extra to make sure that they have a flavor and a uniqueness. It isn't just the same thing that everyone uses. We try to make sure we put something on it that makes it unique to our game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534948"></a><figcaption>The new Wazzard of Wastes enemy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534948-wazzard-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: For me, currently the coolest one I think we've got was the alt fire for the bows. 'Cause [it's] like a rain of [arrows] in an area of effect. I thought that was a nice play on something that's sort of... there's bows in a lot of games, and there's a lot of ways to do it. And I thought that felt really unique to us.</p><p dir="ltr">The mechanic that we've been really buzzing about in the demo is--if you saw it in the live demo--was the [ability to] reflect magic back and forth. It was like a wizard on wizard battle. So, you can actually ping-pong that projectile back and forth, like a parry, right? With swords, that's how it works. If you're timing it right, you can actually bounce that back and forth. And every time that projectile goes back and forth, it gets a little bit more powerful. So, landing that shot could feel very amazing if you are the one sending it. That was one that's been super popular in the studio, that feels really awesome.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Magic ping-pong. Has anyone called it that yet?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: I don't know [laughs]. I'm waiting for you guys to name it so I can stumble over it later.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Magic ping-pong. Write that down [laughs].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>McGregor</strong>: And then, future things. For me, it's Motes. We have a Mote system in the game--it's just kind of bland. It's just stats. And we've come up with this [new] idea that the Motes are creatures that live in your sword and give your sword unique abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">As that system progresses and starts to come together, and we add to it and change it, it's starting to really feel unique to the game. So, I'm excited about where that's heading as a future thing I'm working on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534949"></a><figcaption>The Motes menu, where you choose upgrades and buffs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4534949-motes.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Soulframe is built on a story tied to nature. And we can see that in environments and characters like the bear, Bromius, in the demo. Was there any emphasis being put on adding more talking or singing animal encounters or companions? Because I'm imagining a Disney princess vibe, but just more dangerous.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Yeah, the current lore is it's just our Omen Beasts who can speak. All of the other animals in-game, currently, are just cute little chittering noises. Though we were talking [about]--[and] someone made a joke today about [it having] a Pied Piper vibe--a bunch of little singing and dancing animals following behind a bard. And I thought that would be really cute if they sang.</p><p dir="ltr">But no, I think for now, our Omen Beasts… embody almost the collective spirit of the animal species that they stand for. So Bromius is the collective spirit of all of the bears in Midrath. And so, because of that, he has this extra source of power that allows him to communicate with the Envoy. And I'm sure we'll keep building on that with new Omen Beasts in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any stories or tales you take inspiration from when crafting the narrative that people might not expect?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: Since working on Soulframe, I've gotten super into historical mythologies. And when we first started talking about doing a bear Omen Beast, I definitely did my little research to see what kind of cultures have bears in their myths. And there's a lot of them. We ended up going with the Finnish inspiration because Finland <em>really </em>is passionate about their bears.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, [bears] persist in the mythology [of several cultures]. Back [in] BC--like prehistoric or early historic, ancient antiquity era, they have… I wrote it down… Otso! [He] is this mythological bear that's a part of this really, really awesome poetry epic from Finland that is kind of a creation myth. And it has the bear as the king of the forest. And he's kind of equally feared and respected, which I thought is an interesting thing to think about with Bromius.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll see more of him in the rest of the demo, but he's more than a big, scary guy. He's got a really sweet and soft side that I'm really excited about.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I mean, he </strong><em><strong>was </strong></em><strong>singing to a plant. </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hills</strong>: [laughs] Yeah! You've seen it. It's there.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yeah, I can't wait to see the rest of the demo.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is still in pre-alpha. The game is set to launch for PC later this year.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>What have you played this week?</p>
<ul>
<li>The sun went away long enough for <strong>TSBonyman</strong> to play more Tainted Grail and to make a start on Dead Island 2, or more accurately, a re-start, picking up from his trial save file.</li>
<li>Dead Island 2 was also on <strong>Andrewww’s</strong> playlist, as he checked it out before it left PS Plus. He found it a little disappointing though, so moved along to The Stanley Parable, which he enjoyed somewhat, and watched his daughter playing Astro Bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week’s round up, enjoy the weekend and we’ll see you for more gaming gubbins on Monday.</p>

            <p>Krafton said it "look[s] forward to defending itself in court" after Unknown Worlds' former leadership confirmed they would be suing the publisher after they were suddenly ousted and replaced earlier this month.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>
<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026. It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>"Krafton's decisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players - who are at the heart of everything Krafton does - and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands," a Krafton spokesperson told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/krafton-responds-to-subnautica-founders-lawsuit-we-look-forward-to-defending-ourselves-in-court/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game as quickly as possible to Subnautica’s fans."</p>
<p>All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> last weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would "minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft's own shareholders have directly challenged the publisher to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">launched last April by Accursed Farms YouTuber Ross Scott</a>, calling upon video game fans around the world to petition their local governments regarding the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable due to publisher actions.</p>

<p>The games preservation movement was motivated by Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shut down open-world racer The Crew's servers last March</a>, preventing access to both its multiplayer and single-player content due to its always-online nature. More controversy followed shortly after, when the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">began revoking customers' licenses to the game,</a> permanently removing it from their libraries and preventing hopes of resurrecting it through private servers.</p>
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said, as noted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a> (paywalled) and spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/ubisoft-ceo-addresses-stop-killing-games-after-overseeing-the-deaths-of-the-crew-and-xdefiant-support-for-all-games-cannot-last-forever/">GamesRadar+</a>. "And, whenever we release a game, we provide a lot of support for that game. We also provide a lot of services to make sure that the game is accessible and remains playable 24/7."</p>
<p>Guillemot suggests the publisher already provides "information regarding the game and how long the game can be played", and pointed out it also adds an "online connection required" warning to the front of its boxed products as well as explain that the company can "cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice" in the fine print.</p>
<p>Guillemot also told shareholders it offered "a one-Euro fee proposed to all buyers of the game. For just one Euro they got to buy the next version." As Game File points out, this appears to be in reference to a sale last year that briefly sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> for $1/€1.</p>
<p>"This kind of issue is not specific to Ubisoft," Guillemot added. "All video game publishers are faced with that issue. You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone, and at some point, the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever."</p>
<p>"The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there's a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time," Guillemot concluded. "A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They're no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."</p>
<p>Gulliemot's response, however, feels a tad simplistic, as never-ending access to a game isn't what the Stop Killing Games movement is actually asking for.</p>
<p>"We are in favor of publishers ending support for a game whenever they choose," the FAQs <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">explain</a>. "What we are asking for is that they implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary. We agree that it is unrealistic to expect companies to support games indefinitely and do not advocate for that in any way. Additionally, there are already real-world examples of publishers ending support for online-only games in a responsible way, such as: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-sport">Gran Turismo Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a>."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">consumer-driven initiative</a> is demanding games publishers leave their titles in a playable state once support is terminated, and it's already surpassed 1m signatures. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - weighed in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mario Superstar Baseball" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7802a84e0a688/mario-superstar-baseball.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jonny Malks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Monday 21st July marks the 20th anniversary of Mario Superstar Baseball, so to celebrate Jonny is taking us out to the ball game...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>My first gaming memory: waking up in the middle of the night, heading downstairs, and booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_superstar_baseball">Mario Superstar Baseball</a>'s campaign mode on my GameCube.</p>
<p>It was completely out of character, according to my parents, who still tell the story of my midnight gambit to this day. I had never dared transgress the norms of bedtime before, but my love for Mario and his cadre of ball-playing desperados drew me there – in front of the television in the wee hours of the morning, having the time of my life playing my favourite game. I was six. It was 2005.</p>
<p>Mario Superstar Baseball is reviewed as a completely mediocre game across the board. An ancillary Nintendo sports title developed primarily by Namco and released in the fog of the GameCube's dying breath. Yet it deserves its moment in the spotlight for its ability to show sports kids what makes Mario fun, in a gentle and approachable way. It made video games accessible to those of us in the mid-2000s whose inner nerds waited patiently just beneath the surface. For that reason, Mario Superstar Baseball is more than a nostalgia trip. It's a connector that encourages players old and new to come out of their shells (blue, red, green, or otherwise) and explore the colourful world of games.</p>

<p>When you isolate its core mechanics, Mario Superstar Baseball is pretty close to a rhythm game. Fielding is mostly automated, outside of a few button presses and the option to control players as they race to get underneath pop flies. Thus, the overwhelming majority of gameplay is spent performing baseball’s two other essential functions: pitching and batting.</p>
<p>To pitch, you aim over the plate with the sticks before holding and releasing the 'A' button on time with your character’s specific pitch motion. Part of the game’s nuance is perfecting the timing of these motions across different characters while learning the little tricks that come along with tossing change-ups, curveballs, and special pitches that make use of your character’s “Star Power.” Pro tip: Even though Kamek doesn’t come to mind off the bat as a dominant athlete among the roster of Mario characters included, this Magikoopa’s change-ups rank among the most brutal salvos the game has to offer. Have a go – you’ll be impossible to hit in no time.</p>

<p>Batting, on the other hand, is all about subtle choices. Beginners will charge up their swings by holding 'A' before each pitch, but doing so can throw off your timing, especially on fast balls. What’s more, a lot of skill-based characters, like Daisy and Luigi, are optimised around getting on base with a single button tap at the right time rather than hitting home runs with a supercharged cut at the ball.</p>
<p>Therefore, mastering the art of the bat also requires getting to know each character in your lineup. Knowing how to react when it's Shy Guy’s turn in the order versus a power hitter like Bowser or Donkey Kong constitutes a large part of Mario Superstar Baseball’s catalytic joy. Each character’s play style matches their personality and special traits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> titles might get all the hype these days, especially in this new era of the Switch 2, Mario Superstar Baseball should not be forgotten, as it is a key example of what Nintendo wants to do with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-sports-games-of-all-time">Mario Sports</a> titles. That is, to provide a whimsical on-ramp for new fans to access the joys of the franchise while staying true enough to its roots to delight even those disciples that have enjoyed Mario since the Jump Man days. If you’re ever looking for more blasts from the past in this same vein, have a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a> for the DS (<strong>Mario Slam Basketball</strong> in Europe). Oddly enough, it was developed in collaboration with Square Enix and thus features characters from the Mushroom Kingdom competing against mainstays from the Final Fantasy franchise. A true handheld treat!</p>

<p>Speaking of handhelds, now that the Switch 2 has hit store shelves, Nintendo has managed to reclaim the video game industry spotlight. Every time they release a new console, I can’t help but think back to my favorite hardware from the Nintendo canon – and that frosty night back in 2005, just before New Year’s, when I crawled out of bed and braved the pitch darkness so that I could play a few more delightful innings with Mario and friends.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo and the gaming world at large appear to have all but moved on from Mario Superstar Baseball — especially since the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Super Sluggers</a> for the Wii and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/mario_sports_superstars">Mario Sports Superstars</a> for the 3DS — it’s essential to look back at what makes this game and its quirky little cube-shaped console special as we move into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>While I hope Nintendo does continue to innovate, I also enjoy keeping the lamp lit for less heralded titles from its past that have made a difference larger than the sum of their parts, mediocre reviews and all. Mario Superstar Baseball is one such title, and a reboot in this era of gaming could have the potential to bring us all back to a simpler time. A time when twangy harmonica music played us into a pristine cutscene of Mario making an athletic play at his home stadium, finding a flyer from Bowser challenging his crew for the title of best baseball team in town, and questing from ballpark to ballpark all in the name of good fun and weird minigames. With nothing on the line that a secret midnight foray into the family room couldn’t fix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: </strong></em><em>this article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for Donkey Kong Bananza. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza is now out in the wild, and one of the biggest burning questions ahead of launch centered on DK’s new best friend: Pauline. She’s a teenager in Bananza –  13 years old, to be precise – and this has led to rampant speculation that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey, which features an adult Pauline living in New Donk City. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve played through the main story of Bananza and completed most of its major post-game beats, which means we now have the answers to that question and more. But be warned, we’re about to <strong>spoil the entirety of Donkey Kong Bananza's finale</strong>. So if you’re still working your way to the Planet Core, turn back now, and join us once you’ve seen Bananza through to the end yourself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/new-donk-1752851646893.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline and DK arrive in New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza eventually reveals that 13-year-old Pauline does, in fact, call New Donk City home, just like her Odyssey counterpart, and the story’s grand finale takes place in the metropolis after it’s been completely overrun by the returning King K. Rool. When DK and Pauline break through to the surface, Pauline exclaims “This is MY city!”, confirming the fan theory that Bananza would end by returning Pauline home to Odyssey’s most iconic location. But is this city connection enough to confirm that Bananza is a prequel to Super Mario Odyssey? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some background on Pauline, who is central to this mystery. In Odyssey, Pauline (who’s a full-grown adult) is the Mayor of New Donk City, perhaps most memorable for her performance of Jump Up, Super Star! at the New Donk City Festival. Teenage Pauline and Mayor Pauline share a lot in common: Beyond their shared name, they are both singers and performers, with much of Teenage Pauline’s character arc revolving around gaining enough confidence to perform in front of her hometown. She also sings the Bananza Transformation songs, and Void Kong is obsessed with the power of her voice… at least until King K. Rool boots him out of the story entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on Pauline’s age, most expected Bananza would be a prequel to Odyssey, and potentially an origin story for New Donk City itself. It would make sense that DK, acting as Pauline’s hero and best friend, would prompt the people to name the town after her savior once she was safely returned. But in Bananza, New Donk City is already established before DK and Pauline arrive, and during one of Teenage Pauline’s monologues at a Getaway, she references New Donk City’s nickname “The Big Banana”, a Kong-inspired parody of New York’s “The Big Apple.” It’s a nickname we’ve heard before, first uttered in Mario Odyssey by a New Donker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using all that as a starting point, it seems that there’s actually more evidence to suggest that Bananza is a <em>sequel </em>to Odyssey, and that Teenage Pauline is Mayor Pauline’s daughter, and the granddaughter of original Pauline (who we’ll call Arcade Pauline). Let us explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teenage Pauline regularly references her grandmother throughout Bananza, including one time directly in the main story. After the pair run into Diddy and Dixie Kong in the Racing Layer, Pauline says to DK during the dive to the next layer, “I’m glad you got to see your friends again! But if I don’t get home, Grandma will worry.” Teenage Pauline’s Grandma is the only family member she directly mentions in Bananza, so Nintendo clearly wants us to think about who her grandma is.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/cutscene-1752851935120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pauline says her grandma is at "home", later revealed to be New Donk City. | Image credit: Nintendo </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most likely answer becomes clear when we consider Donkey Kong’s grandfather: Cranky Kong. It is well-established that Cranky Kong is the original Arcade Donkey Kong that kidnapped Arcade Pauline way back in the day. Bananza reinforces this lore, as Cranky rants about his old rival who wore overalls, clearly referencing Mario… or Jumpman, as our favorite plumber was originally known. Cranky and Wrinkly Kong’s son is Donkey Kong Jr., who - despite what the Super Mario Bros. Movie may have tried to tell you - is not actually our current Donkey Kong. Junior starred in the Donkey Kong Jr. arcade game and made various other playable appearances before being essentially wiped from the face of the earth. The tie-wearing Donkey Kong we know and love – first introduced in Rare’s Donkey Kong Country – is actually Donkey Kong <em>the Third</em>, son of Donkey Kong Jr. and an unknown Kong mother. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we’ve established three generations of DK, which brings us back to Pauline. Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline don’t look like the same person. Arcade Pauline has blonde hair, while the Mayor is a brunette. You could argue this is just a character redesign, but a billboard in Odyssey’s New Donk City shows a blonde version of Pauline. Perhaps that’s just a fun easter egg, but perhaps it’s a clue to canon, and we have to use all the evidence we can. The New Donk City Festival – which sees Mario recreating gameplay from the Arcade Donkey Kong game – is held to “tell the story of our city's beginnings," according to Pauline. This implies that New Donk City was founded after the events of the arcade game, built on the foundation of the girders Jumpman climbed up towards Donkey Kong.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/easter-egg-1752851969004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This image of Pauline in Super Mario Odyssey is a reference to the original Pauline from the Donkey Kong arcade game. | Image credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New Donk City is a sprawling metropolis, and it likely took the course of at least a human generation to build it up to such an enormous size. That, combined with the different appearances, leads us to believe that Arcade Pauline and Mayor Pauline are two different people. Perhaps, dare we say, they are mother and daughter? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose it’s possible that Bananza could still be a prequel, that Mayor and Teenage Pauline are one and the same, and that Arcade Pauline is her grandmother with a missing generational link between them, but it feels cleaner to suggest that there are three generations of Pauline: Arcade, Mayor, and Teenage, just like there are three generations of DK: Arcade/Cranky, Jr., and the main DK of today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We really hope our theory that Teenage Pauline is the granddaughter of Arcade Pauline is true, because it’s absolutely adorable that the grandchildren of two of the oldest Nintendo characters have now teamed up and become best friends in Bananza. It’s very cool to think that Nintendo has found a clever way to redefine one of its oldest character dynamics over 40 years later. Unfortunately, completing the bulk of Bananza’s postgame content – which are called Bananza Rehearsals and leads to Bananza’s true final platforming challenge – doesn’t really shed any more light on this. Pauline returns to the surface to perform a song for her city, but all we see of that is a new piece of art that appears after the credits have rolled. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/18/1000006378-1752850870617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Completing Bananza's post-game content unlocks this bonus art that... doesn't really tell us anything new. | Image credit: Nintendo.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while Bananza’s position as a prequel may make a lot of sense, it ultimately can never be more than a theory. There’s just not enough concrete evidence from Nintendo. This theory does raise some concerning, perhaps even supernatural questions about Mario, though. If he has really interacted with multiple generations of Paulines and Donkey Kongs… does this mean Mario never ages, while those around him do? Or are there multiple generations of Mario? Is Nintendo implying that Mario and Jumpman are two different characters? It’s probably best not to think about it too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most crucially, it’s important to remember that Nintendo historically doesn’t care about lore and continuity across its games. Even The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom – a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild – has lore inconsistencies that are ultra-hand-waved away. So it’s quite possible Nintendo doesn’t even have a truly established timeline between the original Donkey Kong, Odyssey, and Bananza, and just loves to keep fans guessing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What do you think is going on in Donkey Kong Bananza? Is Teenage Pauline the daughter of Mayor Pauline and granddaughter of the original Pauline Cranky Kong kidnapped all those years ago, or are we being completely ri-Donk-ulous? Let us know in the comments!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor. The Legend of Zelda is his favorite video game franchise of all time, and he is patiently awaiting the day Nintendo announces a brand new F-Zero.

The tracks are thrilling, with rolling hills and tight turns that sometimes make you feel like you’re on a roller coaster, especially when you’re barreling ahead at super-fast speeds. They all feel distinct, too: In one, you’ll drive over a sandy desert as whale-like creatures jump above you. A course in space forced me to dodge meteors falling on the track. One stage set around a volcano was filled with magma.</p><p>There’s no online multiplayer, so you’re probably going to be competing mostly against computer opponents. They can be tough, even at the lowest difficulty — sometimes it even feels like they can unfairly rubber-band ahead of you. But as I got more familiar with the tracks, knowing when to boost, and learning where to find alternate rounds, I found I was better at keeping up. Fortunately, you don’t have to get first place in a cup to get a good chunk of in-game currency you can use to buy new tracks or vehicles. And you can play local multiplayer, if you want to take on your friends at home.</p><p>If you tire of cups, there are a few other fun modes to play and earn money from. My favorite was “Super Hero Mode,” where you have to get first place in a track without blowing up — with the added twist that your boost meter is also a shield meter, similar to <em>F-Zero</em>. It creates an exciting risk-reward dynamic, and I wish there was a mode where you had to complete a whole cup that way.</p><p>The game’s vehicles are much less interesting than the levels. They all looked pretty generic to me. You can pay a small fee to “fuse” vehicles together to make better racers, though I honestly couldn’t tell that much of a difference between the different options.</p><p><em>Fast Fusion</em> isn’t exactly the same as <em>F-Zero</em>, and I really wish Nintendo would make a brand-new entry in that series. (<em>F-Zero 99</em> doesn’t quite count. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/16/23876228/theres-hope-for-me-yet">Sorry, Wes</a>.) And I’m not getting my hopes up for a new <em>Wipeout</em> game anytime soon. For now, <em>Fast Fusion</em> scratches the high-speed sci-fi racing itch, and it’s a great showcase for what’s possible with the Switch 2 — and what a new <em>F-Zero</em> might, someday, possibly look like.</p><p><sub>Fast Fusion<em> is available now on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705627/fast-fusion-review-f-zero-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems like the Battlefield 6 reveal event may be very close, at last. Content creator Doom49 reported (as screengrabbed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-reveal-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Insider Gaming</a>) having received a promotional package this week, and rivaLxfactor <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1946400245388038395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> a few more details:</p>



<p><em>I have confirmed with another person that there is a 3 day event at the end of July for EA which will include the live reveal of Battlefield 6. It will be much like the BF1 event, with players getting a live round in after the devs speak and video is showcased.</em></p>



<p>This is, perhaps, why EA Games won't be at Gamescom 2025, as their PR agency confirmed to Wccftech. They're going to have their own event, possibly on Tuesday, July 29, and, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/datamine-leak-ea-battlefield-6-open-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidenced by a datamined leak</a>, there might be a public open beta not too long afterward.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been in development for several years, with four studios contributing to the project:</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise creator and caretaker DICE</li>



<li>Motive Studios (Star Wars: Squadrons, Dead Space Remake), which is working on the single player campaign</li>



<li>Criterion Games, which is working on both single player and multiplayer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-dev-dice-la-rebrands-ripple-effect-studios-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple Effect Studios</a>, which worked on Battlefield 2042's Community Portal</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to a report</a> from early July, Electronic Arts has lofty goals for Battlefield 6: it seeks to reach a hundred million players, which would be by far the franchise record. The report also hinted at a $400 million budget, one of the largest in the history of gaming, and various development troubles. </p>



<p>One thing is for sure: Battlefield 6 cannot fail like 2042 and, to a lesser extent, Battlefield V did. To that end, EA should ensure that the game is polished enough before making it to launch. Officially, we only know that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released before the end of EA's fiscal year</a>, which is to say before the end of April 2026.</p>

<p>'That'll do'</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Belkin Charging Case - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce52d06607d4e/belkin-charging-case-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>If there’s one thing that’s more important than keeping your Switch 2 charged when you’re out and about, it’s a solid, reliable case to keep it safe from harm. If you imagine that you could bring those two worlds together, you’d probably be imagining something very similar to Belkin’s Charging Case.</p>
<p>A firm, robust outside only betrays its party trick by nature of being decidedly thicker than most cases. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but sadly the use of that space isn’t exactly perfect.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the positives first, though. Underneath where your console sits is a 10,000 mAh (or 20Wh if you prefer - and you should) battery that nestles itself snugly and still with a short, velcro-fastened strap. On the top side you’ll have the classic screen flap and elasticated game card holders, a mesh pouch with a pleasing lack of any metal to damage your screen, and even a smaller pouch within for housing an Apple AirTag or similar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, things don’t look quite so rosy once you put your console in its place. The fit is just not as good as I would expect from a company like Belkin. The console can fairly freely rock left and right, seemingly due to a combination of the battery acting as a fulcrum and the immense amount of empty space beneath each Joy-Con. There are some lips that should help stop this from happening, but they’re just not enough to prevent it.</p>
<p>Having said that, it does appear that the console is secure once everything’s closed up, but it doesn’t fill us with confidence, especially given the not-insubstantial $69.99 price tag. I really like the case’s ideas, but I do think the execution is less than ideal.</p>
<p>A bit of a rethink and a redesign with a slimmer battery that wouldn’t be so inefficient with space and this could be a serious contender.</p>

<p>Before we find out what we're all up to, however, let's see what's been going on this week. First up, of course, Nintendo released the wonderful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> to widespread critical acclaim, including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> from us.</p>
<p>We also found out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">who will be playing Link and Zelda</a> in the upcoming <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie, while Square Enix sadly confirmed that there will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">no upgrade path</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, though, Sega confirmed that its physical edition for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/sonic-racing-crossworlds-on-switch-2-will-feature-the-full-base-game-on-cartridge">feature the full base game on a 64GB cartridge</a> - huzzah!</p>

<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>The plan? The plan is to get Donkey Kong Bananza and never put it down.</p>
<p>The reality? I'll probably put off buying it and instead sink another 10 hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a>.</p>
<p>It's a tough life.</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend im gonna be joining everyone else in exploring the latest Donkey Kong adventure.</p>
<p>I've only managed about three hours or thereabouts so far, and Im already in danger of spending way too much time just destroying the entire environments. Just because I can.</p>
<p>I will actually be making time for a few other Switch cuts this weekend, too, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> already on my homescreen and awaiting my attention.</p>
<p>Have a good one, shorts fans!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>As predicted, everyone has gone a little bananas this weekend and yours truly is no exception. However I fear I will take far longer than any of my peers to complete Donkey Kong Bananza because I make sure that I smash every single thing that can be smashed before moving on… (Please send help!)</p>
<p>A double dose of shmup action on the way, courtesy of <a href="https://ng.dev/">NG.DEV</a>. Picked up both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gunvein">Gunvein</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_striker_ex">Fast Striker EX</a> so I can try to keep my reflexes at acceptable levels because I want to make sure I continue to be “old school” and not just plain old.</p>
<p>While I continue to make steady progress in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Directors Cut</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>, an inexplicable need to return to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_4">Tekken 4</a> on PlayStation 2 also needed to be inserted onto the weekend rotation. So, like… <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a> on Switch 2 when, Namco? Asking for a friend.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend is largely dedicated to [REDACTED REVIEW GAME], but if I have any time, I'll also be trying to wrap up 100 days in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>.</p>
<p>I also checked out a game the other day called <strong>corru.observer</strong> (link: <a href="https://corru.observer/">https://corru.observer/</a>) — it's this strange, funky little sci-fi game about exploring the remnants of an alien's memories. It's all fractured and corrupted and pixel-bashy, with this fantastic layer of "translation" — the alien language is being fed to you through some kind of Star Trekky auto-translator, and every now and again it'll remind you of this by saying that a word has "no equivalent" but that it's chosen something similar, and provided context. As someone with a background in translation, I think that's super neat! I'll admit that the game takes a while to wrap your head around, especially because the UI is all in-fiction, but I think it's a real treat for anyone who enjoys games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/citizen_sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paradise_killer">Paradise Killer</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6ed521c-5f08-4830-865a-d3f962e557b4" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em></a> continues, the latest Warband to be released is <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> alongside the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em>. This five-Fighter Warband is a group of savage warriors ready to "weaken and bleed their foes" and "hack their heads free." Mixed with the aggressive Raging Slayers deck this is a Warband for those who like picking a target and going until they're destroyed.</p>



<p>The five fighter warband is made up of Kamandora, the guiding hand and matriarch of the group, the powerful Throkk, and the nimble and deadly Ghalista, Antro Krast, and Kannat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-miniatures-and-character-cards.jpg?itok=EDLRSoGU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-miniatures-and-character-cards.jpg?itok=ysUxKqsB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The story of these fighters is that they're a group living in the wastes left by Khorne's armies. Already in their description, you'll begin to get an idea of how they function.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Ghalista, Antro Krast and the hound Kannat weaken and bleed their foes before Throkk hacks their heads free."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The core mechanic of this Warband revolves around the "A Worthy Skull" ability. At the start of the first Action step of each Battle Round a single enemy fighter is selected to be the 'worthy skull'. This ties into not only the narrative, of Kamandora picking what fights her Blades take part in, but also into the Inspiration mechanic of this Warband.</p>

<p>First, you'll be inspiring each friendly fighter adjacent to the enemy worthy skill after a power step, but also if the worthy skull is killed by a friendly fighter they will also be inspired. Tracking down and dealing damage to the worthy skull is further enhanced by the Slaughterous Pilgrimage ability. After picking the worthy skill each friendly fighter must be pushed 1 hex closer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=WC-gZ8N1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-kamandoras-blades-warband-sheet.jpg?itok=Zj0kZBgV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This all lead to a LOT happening at the beginning of each battle round as your opponent gets to learn who your target is, every friendly fighter moves closer, and those who are adjacent get to be inspired.</p>

<p>Inspiring, as you'd expect, will power up each of the Fighters attacks, as well as their defences. This Warband is a seek and destroy machine intended to deal constant damage one enemy at a time. It is a wave that's going to be constantly putting pressure on dealing damage to your enemies and whittling down their forces before they can do anything to push back on you.</p>

<p>The engine of this Warband is extremely clear to understand, it's formulaic yes but if you're wanting to get a better understanding on the rest of the game and want to just run your Warband with a simple strategy it's a great first step to be taking. It's also great for someone like me who tends to appreciate an aggressive approach, as well as the consistency that comes with it.</p>

<h2><em>Raging Slayers</em> Rivals Deck</h2>

<p>When talking about the <em>Kamandora's Blades</em> and their consistent strategy, rolling dice normally laughs in the face of that. With a Rivals Deck like <em>Raging Slayers</em> you can negate that.</p>

<p>When using the <em>Raging Slayers Rivals Deck</em> you'll be able to place a Rage token on any fighter that you pick to use a Charge attacks. These Rage tokens will stay on the fighter until the end of the battle round.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=C1B3oQy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-01.jpg?itok=IBmkWROl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fighter with a Rage token can reroll 1 attack dice immediately after making a melee attack, and if you're attacked and not driven back or grapples you can then push your fighter 1 hex away from the attackers.</p>

<p>Combining the two, you've got a force of enraging fighters, that advance on a selected opponent and power up, and if they're hit have a chance to back away while Enraged.</p>

<p>The Objective Cards of this set are just as aggressive as the abilities would have you believe. Points are scored for killing, enraging, and having a large number of enraged fighters in various areas of the map. If you're playing as aggressively as this deck wants you to then achieving something like having all friendly fighters enraged and in your opponent's territory.</p>

<p>To back up these aggressive Objectives the Power Cards are your disposal are all about making your attacks even more consistent, how you can mitigate taking damage by allowing rerolls on saves, and moving enraged fighters further towards targets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-02.jpg?itok=n2vAroqH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-raging-slayers-02.jpg?itok=Q0UFqUU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Upgrades take this further by adding additional attacks, altering damage types, and providing additional protections while enraged.</p>

<h2><em>Kamandora's Blades </em>and <em>Raging Slayers</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Never before have I see a combination Warband and Rivals Deck that is so straightforward and blood thirsty. The ever encroaching fighters, empowered and buffed, are going to be a terrifying force that will just become scarier as your battles go on.</p>

<p>Seeing either of these players should be warned that they need to take action to slow this Warband's development, or hope they can stay out of reach while working on their own objectives.</p>

<p>For a player who is into a linear strategy, while it might seem obvious, it's surely going to be a consistent strategy to create a tidal wave of attacks making it harder for your opponent to focus on objectives while they're just trying to protect themselves.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, this is a creator tool mode you can access before entering the main game, and it allows you to use the Switch 2's mouse controls to carve out, smoothen, paint, and sculpt works of art.</p>

<p>As more players have now had some time to check out the new game, more creations are being shared online. So, here's a quick look at some of the creative designs DK fans are going bananas for right now.</p>
<p>Many of these designs are doing the rounds on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/">Donkey Kong subreddit</a> as well as social media. First up, we've got a cat:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4qjwrki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Next is Leo Luster – a throwback to the <a href="https://donkeykong.fandom.com/wiki/Leo_Luster">Donkey Kong Country TV Show</a>:</p>

<p>For anyone calling for more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, tell us what you think of this recreation:</p>

<p>Mario's brother Luigi might not be in the new DK outing, but he's still there in spirit:</p>

<p>And how about this classic recreation of DK:</p>

<p>That's just a small sample of the sculptures so far, and it's still early days, so we're sure there'll be plenty of other amazing creations going forward. You can see our full thoughts about this particular mode in our Donkey Kong Bananza review (<em>spoiler: we didn't mind it</em>).</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Although we've been racing around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the past month, there's actually been some activity in the Nintendo mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>.</p>
<p>The game's Pipe Tour is currently back for its second run, and now in another update, Nintendo has announced it will be celebrating the arrival of the Switch 2 game with four new karts as well as some familiar themed outfits for Mario and Luigi.</p>
<p>This Mario Kart World "special campaign" is taking place exclusively in Mario Kart Tour, and is also part of the Sunshine Tour which will run from 23rd July 2025 until 6th August 2025.</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-datamine-suggests-nintendo-isnt-done-with-mario-karts-mobile-entry-just-yet">a rumour in May</a> that Mario Kart Tour would be receiving new content to celebrate Mario Kart World's release.</p>
<p>In some related news, Nintendo has also <a href="https://x.com/SuperMarioRunJP/status/1945741894694416456">announced a new event</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, where you can unlock themed statues to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.

<p>In recent weeks, we've been finding out more details about the developers behind the Switch 2's launch line up of games, and now Nintendo's 1-UP Studio has updated its website with two major projects.</p>
<p>It helped out with not only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> but also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. It previously supported Nintendo EPD on projects like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and assisted with multiple other entries in the Mario series during the same generation. You can see the rest of the company's history <a href="https://1-up-studio.jp/company/history.html">on its official website</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4qjwrki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>According to 1UP's website, its responsibilities on Donkey Kong Bananza included "design, level design, programming" and "part of the sound". As for Mario Kart World, it's mentioned how it assisted with "part of the design". As with many major first-party Nintendo titles nowadays, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/06/xenoblade_studio_monolith_soft_is_helping_make_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">collaborative efforts like this</a> have become increasingly common.</p>
<p>This follows an update from Nintendo earlier this month, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">"the Super Mario Odyssey team"</a> developed DK and Pauline's latest outing for the Switch 2. We've also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-the-voice-actors-behind-dk-and-pauline">confirmation of the voice actors</a> involved in this new entry.</p>

<p>Now arriving this November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2b78ba65d5ed0/inazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Level-5</em></figcaption></figure><p>After multiple delays, Level-5 has announced it will be delaying its upcoming title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> again.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-finally-has-release-date-out-on-switch-2-day-one">previous August release date</a>, it's now been pushed back to <strong>13th November 2025</strong> for the Switch 2, Switch and multiple other platforms. The latest delay is apparently tied to recordings, localisation and "other related processes". Here's the scoop, via the game's <a href="https://x.com/InazumaSeries/status/1946252039518044194">official social media account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important Announcement Regarding the Release Date</strong></p>
<p>Due to the content volume exceeding our initial expectations, additional time is required for voice recording, multi-language localization, and other related processes. As we work toward the final stages of development, we have decided to adjust the release date to ensure the best possible quality.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<div><p>The release date of "Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road" has been changed from August 21, 2025, to [November 13, 2025 (GMT)].</p><p>

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to all the fans who have been eagerly waiting for a long time, and truly appreciate your understanding and continued support.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see the video below detailing this delay and it also reiterates how development is apparently in the "final stages". The team believes this next date is when it will "finally be able to release the game".</p>
<p>The same video also highlights the development progress and improved features players can expect when this title does finally arrive. The team does not want to make any compromises and intends to use the extra time to further polish and enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>This delay follows Level-5's launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which got off to a positive start in its opening months – surpassing 1.2 million in "global cumulative sales".</p>
