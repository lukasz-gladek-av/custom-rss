            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/football-manager-25-will-feature-womens-teams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A new development update for Football Manager 25 has been released by Sports Interactive, highlighting how this will be a new start for the series. That is because Football Manager 25 will mark the franchise moving to the Unity engine, and it will likely be the main engine for the next 20 years. The first look at the user interface has been shown too, showing the tile and card system.</p>

		
		

<p>What the screenshots show are how Football Manager 25 will be changing the way players interact with the game going forward. The first screenshot shows the updated information screen players will see between highlights during matchdays. On it, you can see that the pitch takes centre stage as normal, with both team tactical line ups on either side of it. Below these are the match stats, match events, and other match scores from around the league. Under all of that is the team line up with player condition. The second screen shows the new Portal, with the Inbox being consigned to history. With the Portal you will have an Agenda list showing tasks that need to be completed, news from the football world, the calendar, and messages from everyone you interact with. The final two screens show player form details, detailing their performance over the last five matches, and how they have contributed to the team.</p>


<p>Football Manager 25 will see other things taken out. Matchday touchline shouts will not be present in the game. They may return in future Football Manager releases, but only if the development team believe they fit properly. The data chalkboard will not be back in Football Manager 25. Create A Club will not be in the game either, though Sports Interactive are aiming to bring it back for Football Manager 26 with major improvements. Versus mode is another mode that will not be in the game, as only 0.5% of players were playing it. Challenge Mode is being revamped as well, with it returning in either Football Manager 26 or Football Manager 27. Fantasy Draft will be part of Football Manager 25 but not day one. This will instead come further down the line in an update.</p>
<p>Miles Jacobson also confirmed in the development update that Football Manager 25 will be the first game in the series to include women’s football, and multiple licenses have been signed. However, the details of which leagues and teams will be playable has not been released yet, with that information coming at a later date.</p>

                <p>Hearthstone's next expansion, Perils in Paradise, is launching on July 23. And while the tropical-themed expansion is mostly about kicking back and relaxing on the beach, everybody knows that when you go on vacation, you should keep a close eye on your wallet. Sure enough, the Rogue package for the upcoming expansion has big burgle synergy, with cards that reward you for exercising the old five-finger discount.</p><p>The leader of the gang is <strong>Treasure Hunter Eudora</strong>, a Rogue legendary card (with a lovely Signature variant). The 6-mana 4/5 Pirate has a Battlecry that gives you a Sidequest token, Eudora's Treasure Hunt. The Sidequest challenges you to play three cards from other classes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790" data-ratio="1.4343971631206" data-width="564" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325790"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325790-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4325791,1300-4325792,1300-4325793" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325791-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_normal.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325792-rogue_vac_464_enus_treasurehuntereudora-109463_signature.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4325793-rogue_vac_464t_enus_eudorastreasurehunt-112025_normal.png"></figure><p>To help you complete the task, Eudora has brought a couple of scurvy scalawags along with her, and a big spell that will help remove threats while you plan your heist. <strong>Sea Shill</strong> is a 3-mana 3/2 pirate that gives you a 2-mana discount on the next non-Rogue card you play. <strong>Conniving Conman</strong> is a 4-mana 4/4 pirate that lets you double up on your stolen goods by replaying the last card you played from another class.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/28/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-goes-gold-pc-specs-and-20-minutes-of-gameplay-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn has gone gold, meaning it should be all but ready for its release on July 18. Developer A44 (Ashen) has also released the game’s PC specs and 20-minutes of raw gameplay footage.</p>

<p>The upcoming "Souls-lite" fantasy action game stars elite soldier Nor Vanek and her furry fox-like companion&nbsp;Enki on a revenge quest to kill the gods of their world. She wields an arsenal of melee, firearms, and magic that can be chained to create stylish combo attacks. Nor Venek also has special traversal abilities to navigate the world, which is being besieged by the angry deities.</p>

<p>We last saw Flintlock during the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-sets-july-launch">Xbox Games Showcase</a> a few weeks ago, but you can check out 20 minutes of new gameplay footage in the video below. Set during a later stage of the game, a synopsis adds context to the footage: "Join Nor and Enki as they prepare to step into the deserts of Wanderer’s Rest to take on the personal guard of the god Dukmar. With an entire army hunting for her, Nor will need all of her skills to make it to her eventual destination - the City of Sibyl, where she hopes the gods’ true intentions will finally be revealed."</p>

Unfortunately, the arrival of the Lich King's weapon is also accompanied by portals filled with undead, which players will need to battle against over the course of the July 4-26 event. They'll receive a little undead help of their own, however. A new power, Chill of the Frozen Throne, will see players earn a 10% damage increase after killing five monsters, as well as the ability to raise up to five skeletal minions to fight by their side, no Necromancer required.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ov-entertainments-quest-to-unite-latin-american-games-firms-begins-with-kokku-3ogs-acquisitions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>CEO Thiago de Freitas tells us "the future of games development is coming from South and Latin America"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The newly-formed OV Entertainment Group has made its first two acquisitions: Brazilian developer Kokku and Argentinian tools and tech specialist 3OGS.</p>
<p>Both were acquired for an undisclosed sum and form the basis of a group that aims to unite Latin American games companies in order to accelerate their growth and give them access to resources they would otherwise be unable to reach.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> sat down with key execs from all three companies during Gamescom Latam in São Paulo this week, where the vision for the group was described as the brainchild of Thiago de Freitas, founder of Kokku and now CEO of OV Entertainment.</p>
<p>De Freitas (pictured above left) explained that the idea began following a string of acquisition offers for Kokku, one of the largest studios in Brazil and one of the few with AAA development experience. Kokku provides services ranging from art production and co-development to full game development, and has contributed to games such as Horizon Fobidden West, Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War, Prison Architect 2, and more.</p>
<p>"We always wanted to show the world that the future of games development is coming from South America and Latin America, but we decided it's not for us to sell the company to any of these other groups or institutions," the CEO told us. "We really understand the culture, we don't want to be diluted into a different brand. And since we are Latin Amercians and we're proud of that, we know how to work with the culture, with the politics and labour laws, and all the weird financial taxes you need to pay here. Having this kind of understanding helps us to grow business here.</p>
<p>"That's one of the big reasons why Kokku was never sold to anyone, and why we decided to start uniting the Latin America game companies."</p>
<p>De Freitas added that Kokku's reputation and established contacts will help elevate other companies in the group, ones that may not have had the same opportunities before or lacked the structure and resources to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>"Companies like 3OGS, they're very talented, extremely skilled but they were struggling to find better companies and to reach other clients because they didn't have access to investment money and go beyond what they were already doing," he said.</p>
<p>3OGS, which stands for Three Ordinary Guys Studio, is a tech specialist based in Argentina and the team first met with De Freitas nearly two years ago when they were seeking investment. Co-CEO Pablo Navajas (pictured above right) said that when he heard the overall vision for OV Entertainment, it was "beyond our imagination."</p>
<p>"It was aligned with what we wanted to do in future, but we had that ambition alone and with [OV] we have the opportunity to accelerate that process," he said.</p>
<p>"We've also had companies trying to acquire us in the past, but this was the first time we felt like, 'Yes, this is the sort of future we want to shape.' This is going to be the huge step we wanted to do, just more quickly."</p>
<p>Navajas added that being part of a larger group will enable 3OGS to be involved in more complex projects and recruit larger teams to handle them.</p>
<p>De Freitas also hinted that this group will go beyond video games development and services, expressing a "broader vision of tapping into film, TV and other areas."</p>
<p>While OV Entertainment will focus on acquiring companies from Latam markets, the parent company itself is registered and based in the UK, with chief strategy officer Chris Bergstresser (pictured above) telling us this will make it easier for the group to access capital and operate with a more global focus.</p>
<p>Crucially, Bergstresser said the company has been watching other, larger games and services groups carefully and aim to learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>"The idea [Embracer] got correct is operational independence," he said, by way of example. "Ultimately, the only value in any company is the teams that are there. The reason why you get the best talent is because people love the working methodologies and the culture of those companies. Those are preserved.</p>
<p>"While Kokku and 3OGs are all part of OV Entertainment, it's the same shareholders so I wouldn't say they've lost independence. No one will do that in the future. It's effectively the same guys running the companies as it was before."</p>
<p>De Freitas added: "When we created OV Entertainment, it was to make sure we would use the company not like a Keywords or Embracer or these other groups, but we want to be a backstage kind of group. We're not here to take the lead or to dilute brands."</p>
<p>Navajas concurred, emphasising that a key reason 3OGS agreed to this acquisition was because the team can "make our own decisions [and] keep our clients."</p>
<p>"I think this is going to be a great group, and the next few years are going to be great. If we went alone, this sort of thing would have taken us another ten years, and now we can be there in two to three years."</p>

Where were you all when I was the last holdout of my middle school lunch period trying to do synchro-summons because I thought they were the coolest thing in the world? I ask this because there has not only been a discernable uptick in the trading card game and video games’ popularity of late, but some guy is now pulling out cards and winning Olympic qualifying races like some kind of mad man.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191665" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="141" data-playlist="191665,194718,194547" data-current="191665"><div><p>This Hearthstone Deck Will Kill You In One Turn</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191665/191665_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17440.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Noah Lyles, who’s evidently on his way to representing the US in the Paris Olympics later this year, is also apparently the Olympics preeminent <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>scholar. Before his recent heats (or races), Lyles has been flashing popular <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards to the cameras, including Blue-Eyes White Dragon and the head of Exodia, before tucking them back <em>into </em>his running suit. To top it all off, or perhaps to add insult to injury, he’s been <em>winning </em>these races as well. Folks, I think we may have discovered the fastest geek alive.</p><p>After flashing the head of Exodia just the other day, Lyles has followed it up in the most delightfully predictable way: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1806679621313720498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two<em> more</em> pieces of Exodia</a></span>. For the uninitiated, unaware, and unbothered, Exodia is a legendary monster in the fiction of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>. It’s so powerful that when it was sealed away as a card, it was split into several pieces in the hope that they would never be used for fear of its literal destructive power. Thus, there are five pieces of Exodia: a head, two arms, and two legs.</p><p>In practice, Exodia is one of the most potent monsters to have in your deck because simply drawing all five pieces immediately wins the game. The modern version of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> features mechanics that allow for Exodia to be taken out of play, or at the very least mitigated, so it isn’t <em>all </em>powerful like it used to be. Still, a player stunned a crowd by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/yu-gi-oh-legend-uses-the-iconic-exodia-to-win-a-modern-tournament-match-as-the-crowd-chants-one-more-piece-and-even-his-opponent-claps-for-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winning a tournament using Exodia</a></span> just last year, so they’ve still got the juice, and that’s seemingly what Lyles is suggesting about himself.</p><p>In the same interview where he flashed both the right and left arms of Exodia, Lyles claimed that “Now it’s time to build the whole thing. I got the left and right arms, and I got the legs coming tomorrow.” When the interviewer had <em>zero </em>clue what Lyles was telling him, he clarified, “All the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>fans know. Something big is coming.”</p><p>Lyles isn’t just pulling out the cards because he’s a huge fan of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>and anime though. In an incredibly cute twist, he’s actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/24/noah-lyles-yu-gi-oh-cards-olympics/74194959007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flashing them as part of a bet</a></span> with another athlete, the world champion shot putter Chase Ealey. According to Lyles, they have a running bet which stipulates that if he flashes <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>cards before his heats throughout the ongoing Olympic trials, Ealey will wear Rock Lee’s (of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naruto-live-action-shang-chi-director-1851283058"><em>Naruto</em></a></span>) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDzse1-2W8Q&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leg weights</a></span>—which ironically make him super fast-–and take them off during her own finals. This might be the best sports anime I’ve ever seen.</p><p>It now seems incredibly likely that we’ll see Lyles pull out the entirety of Exodia over the course of his Olympic trials, and seeing as how he keeps knocking wins back, only time will tell what else he’s got up his suit. I only pray that he makes it to the Olympics and keeps this bit up for the hell of it. In the meantime, do you think he’s taking suggestions? If so, bring out Black Luster Soldier next, king. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Along with providing easier access to the original trilogy, DRM-free, GOG has also revealed that the original version of Resident Evil 2 is based on the 1998 Windows PC version. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's been hard keeping this secret but I'm happy to announce that GOG is doing the impossible and is bringing back the classic Resident Evil Trilogy! I've played the ports of RE1/2, and here are my thoughts on what I've experienced! RTs very appreciated! <a href="https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/lh4dHfsnYd</a> <a href="https://t.co/p15HI87qTO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/p15HI87qTO</a></p>— Suzi Hunter (@TheSphereHunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSphereHunter/status/1805934519943569909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The news was <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag?si=cU4011hLRCva3cr3&amp;t=436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reported by YouTuber The Sphere Hunter</a>, who revealed she had the chance to play the first two games in advance — revealing that Resident Evil 2 classic was based on the original Windows PC version, not the Sourcenext version. A GOG spokesperson also confirmed this detail to IGN in a statement sent via email. </p><p>If you're unfamiliar with these two ports, the former was released in 1998 for Windows 98, while the latter, developed by software company Sourcenext, was a WindowsXP-compatible port released exclusively in Japan in 2006. </p><p>The biggest difference between these two versions is that the Sourcenext version provided higher-quality full-motion videos (FMVs). Many Resident Evil fans have argued that the Sourcenext version was the definitive way to play Resident Evil 2 on PC. Though this version was only released in Japan, as content creator Ultra Creed <a href="https://youtu.be/N-XB8ctbteE?si=maRyIcp949ZKlPDE&amp;t=759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a>, fans have used the Resident Evil 2 Classic REbirth mod to not only translate the Sourcenext version to English (minus the FMVs) but also add support for modern controllers and added optional gameplay features you could enable, such as quick turns and tactical reloads.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/03/23/resident-evil-2-7">our review of the original PC version of Resident Evil 2</a>, IGN wrote: "It's just too shallow for the average PC gamer. With such little change over the Playstation version, it makes you wonder why it took Capcom three months to get this one out on the PC." </p><p>The original Resident Evil is now available on GOG. Resident Evil 2 and 3 are not available yet.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Of course, the list will likely grow now that the latest tech is available. </p><p>AMD and Nixxes' collaboration is no surprise.

The latest version of this technology aims to improve upscaling image quality in supported games and "decouple" the company's FSR 3 frame generation tech from the standard FSR 3. The latter means that PC players can use FSR Frame Generation concurrently with Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) or Intel's Xe Super Sampling XeSS tech. </p><p>AMD further revealed in the blog post that the third-generation of FSR 3 has expanded, with 60 games now available or soon to be released supporting the tech. Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Starfield, Concord, and The First Descendant are among the games supporting FSR 3.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Here’s what we’ve learned about <em>Elden Ring</em>, its story, and its characters while playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <strong>Major spoilers incoming. </strong></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114319"><a id=""></a><strong>What is the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>The Realm of Shadow is essentially an alternate, death-filled version of the Lands Between. The Scadutree at its center is literally a shadow version of the Erdtree in the Lands Between, and the prevalence of ghostly tombstones and coffins delineate that this is a world steeped in death. Though the Realm of Shadow exists under a veil, it’s believed to be sitting smack in the center of the original <em>Elden Ring </em>map, right under that cloud that’s just south of the Erdtree.<br></p><h2 id="h114320"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Messmer the Impaler?</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743">Messmer </a></span>is the son of Queen Marika, and the brother of Malenia and Miquella. He was born with a snake living inside of him (that he calls the Abyssal Serpent) which threatened to take him over, so his mother contained the serpent by removing one of Messmer’s eyes and placing a magical seal there instead.<br></p><p>Before the Elden Ring shattered, Messmer was sent to the Realm of Shadow to purge the tower-dwellers (the Hornsent) who were not followers of Marika’s religion/bathed in the light of grace. Remember: in the Lands Between, the Hornsent are called Omens, and are shunned from society or killed in attempts to remove their horns. That’s because they represent the dominant religion of the land <em>before</em> the establishment of the Greater Will and its vassal, Marika. As we progress through the DLC, however, the beef between Marika and the Hornsent gets a bit more complicated (more on that later).<br></p><p>For some reason, Marika abandoned Messmer in the Realm of Shadow, but he refused to stop purging folks. </p><figure id="" data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-recommend-id="image://514cb2c8811f28ac54c8776ab5b840bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Freyja believes Radahn wants to be be brought back for &quot;endless war.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114321"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is Kindly Miquella and why did he go to the Shadow Realm?</strong></h2><p>Miquella is the twin brother of Malenia, both born to Marika and Radagon and both cursed—Malenia with scarlet rot, and Miquella with eternal youth. Though Miquella traps himself in a cocoon at the base of a tree he tried to grow to cure himself and Malenia, he is stolen while in slumber by Mohg, who wanted to use his blood in order to start his own empire (though now, it appears that Miquella may have tricked Mohg into doing all of this so he could enter the Realm of Shdaow).<br></p><p>When Miquella fell into his slumber, he entered the Realm of Shadow to find the soul of the Promised Consort, who turns out to be Radahn, the very same Radahn who is the child of Radagon and Rennala. Miquella wants to stand at the gates of divinity (seen in the trailer for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>) and complete a ritual in order to become a god. That ritual involves capturing the dead Radahn’s soul in Mohg’s body—remember, you have to kill both of those bosses in the base game to even start the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, and now we know why.<br></p><h2 id="h114322"><a id=""></a><strong>Why did Miquella choose Radahn as his Consort?</strong></h2><p>Some think that Miquella chose Radahn to be his Consort because of his sheer strength as a demigod—the only person to best him was Malenia, and perhaps her Scarlet Rot affliction made it impossible for Miquella to name her as Consort. A cutscene that plays after you defeat Radahn in the DLC shows that Miquella proposed some sort of vow to Radahn that would result in him becoming his consort after ascending to Godhood. It’s unclear if that’s why that big battle between Malenia and Radahn that we saw in the original trailer for <em>Elden Ring</em> took place—if that battle was part of the vow or something else entirely. We also don’t know for sure if Radahn accepted the vow <em>or</em> was just acting while under the influence of Miquella, who can even charm the player during the final boss bottle, stealing your heart and insta-killing you.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-recommend-id="image://8ff4f9ae51c10d59d3e205f063d15011" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ansbach realizes what Miquella wants to do with Radahn and Mohg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114323"><a id=""></a><strong>What does Miquella want, and is he all that Kindly?</strong></h2><p>Early on in the DLC, you meet several NPCs who represent different factions in this world: Needle Knight Leda, the last remaining footsoldier for Miquella; Freyja, who once fought alongside Radahn; the Hornsent, a member of the aforementioned tower folk; and Sir Ansbach, who served Mohg. Though they come from disparate backgrounds, they are all in the Realm of Shadow to find “kindly Miquella,” and they recruit you, as well.<br></p><p>But it appears that Miquella charmed all of them, twisting their minds to support his cause. That’s why, when you head towards the Shadow Keep (Messmer’s castle), an in-game event will take place: you hear the audio cue for using a rune arc, and the words “somewhere, a great rune has broken…and so too has a powerful charm.” After speaking to the NPCs, you learn that Miquella himself broke this rune, thus also freeing all of those under his charm. They’re confused, uncertain who to follow or where to go, as they were only united because Miquella was forcing them to be. Ansbach remembers fighting Miquella for Mohg, calling the once-Kindly Miquella a “monster.”<br></p><p>After this event takes place, Miquella’s goal becomes even more clear: the crosses you find scattered across the map are places where Miquella has shed parts of his being in order to be born anew, and breaking his rune arc is part of that process.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-lore-messmer-miquella-1851492064">I posited before the release of the DLC</a></span> that Miquella wanted to right his mother Marika’s wrongs, and bring justice to the people of the Realm of Shadow who were (seemingly) crusaded against because of their horns (more on that later), and that still seems to be the case. Miquella wants to bring about an “Age of Compassion,” and many NPCs reference his love, but the way he’s going about everything is pretty fucked up—charming people into fighting for him and using the dead body of one lord to house the soul of another.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-recommend-id="image://1e8322173671c8581bc2c5115d371c6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tarnished kneels before St. Trina." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h114324"><a id=""></a><strong>Who is St. Trina?</strong></h2><p>St. Trina is only briefly mentioned in the base game, but she has a whole section dedicated to her in the DLC, and an NPC dedicated to her as well: Thiollier. The DLC confirms beliefs that players have had for years: St. Trina and Miquella are the same person, just like Radagon and Marika are believed to be two halves of a whole. A cross near where you can find St. Trina confirms that this is where Miquella discarded his “love.” And yes, just like Radagon and Marika, a soul can clearly exist in two different bodies in this world—and fall in love with itself.

We now know that, at some point, the Hornsent were torturing the shaman—an item you can find called the Tooth Whip describes this process.

Can time slow down? No? Okay. Fine. Well, at least we’re at the weekend, so that means (hopefully) you have some free time to spend on video games. This week we’ve rounded up an eclectic mix of eight games worth checking out as you shelter from the heat (assuming it’s hot where you are. If not, well, aren’t you lucky? Unless it’s too cold. Look, you can manage your own weather).  </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-recommend-id="image://e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-recommend-id="image://e1f4d8af1a6790a957fbbeb875c7d23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big monster looks down at someone off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Finish the post-<em>Endwalker</em> patches before <em>Dawntrail</em> releases</p><p>After putting it off for as long as I possibly could, I finally finished <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span> literally hours before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a></span>’s servers went down for maintenance.

Even with the uneven pacing of <em>Endwalker</em>, I still grew to love the expansion in the end, and it reaffirmed why I keep coming back to <em>F14</em>, so I am re-energized to dive in for more. </p><p>That being said, post-expansion patches are often a major slog and I can’t help but worry I’m in for some tedious questing. I do know that there are some things to look forward to: namely meeting Zero and tackling the Myths of the Realm raid series. Whatever the case, I only have this weekend to marathon through the remaining quests ahead of <em>Dawntrail’</em>s wide release on July 2. I’m gonna be optimistic and say I can get it done with time to spare. — Willa Rowe</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-recommend-id="image://fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-recommend-id="image://fb2c2769b69d63bebd90484dd2a8c579" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Beyond Good &amp; Evil sneaks around a corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)</p><p><strong>Current goal:</strong> Just be. Goals are pressure.</p><p>Every time I replay <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, I forget how it starts. In my memory, it’s a game that begins with heroine Jade on her lovely, idyllic island, running around taking photographs of all the various beasties, and then, eventually, attacks rain from the skies. So I’m bemused, each time, when it’s the other way around.</p><p>I’m pretty disappointed by the state of the Steam release of the game. For no good reason you have to play it through an Ubisoft Connect account, and it lacks basic PC options like a way to play in a window on my ultra-widescreen monitor. (It even overrides Steam launch settings to force this!) Also, other people on Steam are so VERY mad that it doesn’t have the promised achievements. It’s not an auspicious launch. But it’s still <em>BG&amp;E</em>, a game that I seem to replay every five or so years. So much so that honestly, I don’t want a sequel. I certainly don’t want a sequel that looks like anything in any of the bullshit trailers that have appeared over the years, pretending to be from a game that exists. The original is plenty. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><div id="191891"><div data-video-id="191891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="kinjavideo" data-video-title="This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="191891" data-current="191891"><div><p>This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" playsinline="" poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/197xrjaz7466rpng.png" data-poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/d6725de22c32d1bb16f48a5f6298c92b.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191891/191891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><figcaption>This Game Teaches You How To Use A Synthesizer IRL</figcaption></div><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Develop a better understanding of control voltage</p><p>I do love video games, but I probably love making music even more. And over the past five years, I’ve only developed a greater appetite for and interest in synthesis—particularly modular synthesis, as I’m no keyboard player.

That’s not necessarily a problem, but I could use a better understanding of how voltage flows, combines, splits, can be attenuated, and more. <em>The Signal State</em>’s puzzles are all about that, asking you to route signal paths in specific ways such as, “SRC 2 is a binary signal. When it is at 100 volts, send SRC 1 to OUT 1. Otherwise, send 0 volts to OUT 1,” or, “Send SRC 1 to OUT 2, but with its intensity boosted by a percentage by SRC 2.”</p><p>Riveting stuff, huh? Sure, it’s dry. But dry is what I need right now and <em>The Signal State</em> seems like the perfect set of exercises for me to just drill the basics of voltage flowing across a system. This is especially useful for me as I’m slimming down the number of individual Eurorack modules I own to prioritize my use of semi-modular gear. So as I figure out what modules I’m keeping to fit into a tinier, more portable 42HP rack, hopefully <em>The Signal State</em> will key my brain into thinking more about direct utility and voltage control than shiny, fancier stuff (but damn do I really want that Qu-Bit Nautilus delay module and maybe it was a mistake to sell my Monsoon…).</p><p>And though I do use and love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://vcvrack.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://vcvrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VCV Rack</a></span>, that’s an actual piece of music software and doesn’t have the puzzles, challenges, and restrictions that are conducive to making progress in learning new skills (especially musical ones). — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-recommend-id="image://4cde24bffe19f4e6f0a7b9521caea734" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Barret and Red XII fight monsters in a cave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get the fuck out of the Gold Saucer</p><p>I’m back in the Cait Sith saddle folks and it feels, ugh, fine. I was having a blast with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </em>at first—funny dialogue, beautiful cinematics, and just the right mix of open world fluff—but I hit a wall in Costa Del Sol that stopped me dead in my tracks. That whole completing random mini-games, including actual honest to god Fiverr-style gig work just to get bathing suits to get on the beach to do a random boss fight that didn’t exist in the original game was just not working for me. More recently, I’ve been making my way through Corel and to the Gold Saucer and the ups and downs are getting even more uneven. </p><p>One minute I’m having a blast opening treasure chests, grinding fights, and listening to cool soundtrack remixes. The next I’m Yuffie doing…an extremely stiff grappling hook swing from one environmental interactivity node to the next. Eco terrorists saving the planet from alien-infused super soldiers? Haha fuck yeah!!! Yes!! Shooting boxes on a mine cart? Well this fucking sucks. What the fuck. When I reached the Gold Saucer in the original game it was a fun reprieve. This time I can’t wait to be done with it. Fortunately, the core of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> remains strong enough to barrel me through from one ridiculous design choice to the next.

I’m so used to games ascribing scores based on how well you play, so I was shocked when <em>Fallen Aces </em>refused to judge me for occasionally fudging stealth segments and going loud. That flexibility and encouragement to improv your way through a level is what’s going to usher me through the end of the current early access build.

A lot of those copies may have been bought by normies just eager to see what the CD-ROM drives on their pricey new PCs could do, because when I bring it up in gaming circles, I’m more often met with derision than reverence. “The puzzles sucked!” many say. “It’s just so boring.” Well, it certainly made for a stark contrast with <em>Doom</em>, released the same year, and while I admired both, <em>Myst</em>’s<em> </em>was the world I got utterly lost in. I think everything about the game is brilliant. Its distinctive architecture and atmosphere seeped into my mind so deeply that, out and about in the real world, I’d sometimes spot something vaguely <em>Myst</em>-like and feel transported into the game. And I think its puzzles were brilliant, each so distinctive and absorbing, with all the information you needed to solve them able to be picked up through experimentation and examination of the environment around you. <em>Myst </em>is a masterpiece, one of the games of my life. </p><p><br>But when its sequel landed a few years later, I was in no position to play it. Here it was, the follow-up to one of the most mind blowing and formative experiences of my life as a lover of video games, and I missed it. By the time, years later, that things in my life had settled and I actually could play it, the moment had passed, and despite my love for <em>Myst</em>, I struggled to go back to a game with rigid, node-to-node movement, even one as gorgeous as <em>Riven</em>. Now, finally, this landmark sequel has gotten the remake treatment it so clearly deserved, and I can experience its atmosphere and its puzzles in free-look, free-movement glory. I admit I think that inevitably, when remaking a game like <em>Riven</em>, some things will be lost even as others are gained—I will always prefer the original’s live-action characters to the 3D models of those in the remake (watch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jLCGegxqu3Q?si=JR8tACOcc1a8HbTb&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jLCGegxqu3Q?si=JR8tACOcc1a8HbTb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the early stretch of this video</a></span> for a comparison of the two)—but the environments look incredible. This weekend I’ll find out if the rest of <em>Riven</em>—its puzzles, its narrative, its music—can cast a spell on me like the one its predecessor once did, all those years ago.—Carolyn Petit  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e62338d6f0d03b29e3581af08d15da57" data-recommend-id="image://e62338d6f0d03b29e3581af08d15da57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand near a portal and a bridge in Diablo 4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand near a portal and a bridge in Diablo 4." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e62338d6f0d03b29e3581af08d15da57" data-recommend-id="image://e62338d6f0d03b29e3581af08d15da57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand near a portal and a bridge in Diablo 4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Play more of the current season</p><p><em>Diablo IV </em>was a game I sunk far, far too many hours into when it launched last year. But I eventually burned myself out a bit, and stopped playing once I wrapped up the main story and some of the endgame. But recently, I felt this urge deep inside to wander around dungeons, killing thousands of demons while collecting loot. So I booted up <em>Diablo 4 </em>again to check out the new season. </p><p>I’ve never played the seasons in <em>Diablo 3</em> or this latest entry. But I made a new character, a druid, and hopped in. I really think Blizzard needs to do more to explain what is happening, where to go, and the gameplay loop of the season, because it took me some time and googling to figure it out. However, now that I (mostly) understand what I’m doing, I’m having a blast in <em>Diablo 4. </em>The loot is flowing, the demons are dying and my druid is quickly growing in power as I complete quests and level up the battle pass. I’m not sure I’ll be back for every future season, but with the new expansion coming later this year, I’m suddenly much more excited about <em>Diablo 4</em> in 2024 than I expected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it. While the removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient given they can be detached for wireless use, their tiny contourless design isn’t that comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">Joy-Con drift</a> and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.</p><p>In this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fc%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fcontrollers%2F">PowerA</a> and <a href="https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p><p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:</p><div><ul><li>It won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present.&nbsp;</li><li>Many third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.</li><li>Most non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games.&nbsp;</li><li>Most third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.)&nbsp;</li><li>While some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690100/how-to-pair-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-nintendo-switch">pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch</a> is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.</li></ul></div><div><p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a>, meanwhile, makes for a great Xbox-style controller with exhaustive customization, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Ergonomic-Controller-Handheld/dp/B08FJ7XY3B?tag=theverge02-20">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8SK9B/?tag=theverge02-20">DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller</a>, both of which are well worth a look.</p></div><div><p><h3>What we’re looking for</h3></p><p><h4><strong>Connectivity</strong></h4></p><p>Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?</p><p><h4><strong>Quality</strong></h4></p><p>Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?</p><p><h4><strong>Extra features</strong></h4></p><p>Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?</p><p><h4><strong>Customization</strong></h4></p><p>Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?</p><p><h4><strong>Value</strong></h4></p><p>Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?</p></div><p><h3>The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode</h3></p><div><p>The Switch Pro released alongside the Switch console in 2017, and it’s a tough controller to beat. It offers an unmatched set of features (HD rumble, motion controls, NFC), and it’s one of the most comfortable Switch controllers out there.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes, HD / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>More than seven years down the road, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller is still the best gamepad for the Switch. It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. </p><p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p><p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p><p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p><p><h3>The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h3></p><div><p>The Split Pad Pro represents Hori’s take on the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, one that is split into two separate pieces. The Split Pad Pro is a good Joy-Con alternative for people who primarily play their Nintendo Switch in handheld mode.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p><p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p><p>The company also sells the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY?tag=theverge02-20">costs around $50</a>. It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.</p><div><p>The Hori Split Pad Pro is a comfortable controller that may be larger than your standard Joy-Cons but is more ergonomic.<br></p></div><p><h3>The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch </h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="7csjbY" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-NS-Switch-Joysticks-Button%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09MS2VFSB/?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><p>If you’re looking for a Switch controller that’s also a great Bluetooth controller for PC, Mac, Steam Deck, iOS, and Android, GuliKit’s KingKong 2 Pro is a worthwhile purchase. It has drift-free Hall effect analog sticks, Amiibo support, and it feels like an Xbox controller in the hand.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KingKong-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Bluetooth/dp/B09QJN8ZD9?tag=theverge02-20">GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro</a> rivals the Switch Pro Controller in build quality, but it feels more like a modern Xbox controller, and its textured rear grips might give it the edge for some. Unlike most third-party controllers, it retains Amiibo support, though some users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/vmiyjh/gulikit_king_kong_pro_2_amiibo_compatibility/">have reported issues</a> with inauthentic Amiibo products. The KingKong 2 Pro can connect via Bluetooth to the Switch and to PC, macOS, iOS, Android, and other platforms. And because it uses GuliKit’s Hall effect sensors for its analog sticks, it’s immune to drift.</p><p>We recommend checking out <a href="https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY">this video at iFixit</a> to see a thorough explanation of how it works, but in essence, Hall effect sensors use magnets to alter electrical current instead of physically rubbing on (and eventually wearing down) a sensor to produce an input. While we haven’t heard widespread reports of chronic analog stick drift issues on the Switch Pro Controller thus far, controllers with Hall effect sensors will never<em> </em>encounter it, and the peace of mind is worth the added cost. (The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller below <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1564852820141957120">also uses GuliKit’s sensors</a>.)</p><p>Control-wise, almost everything about the KingKong 2 Pro feels just right. The face buttons, bumpers, and D-pad all strike a balance between travel, tactile feedback, and feel. The analog sticks are incredibly fluid yet easily snap back into their default positions. Clicking the sticks doesn’t require much force, either, even when they’re off-axis. And while we can’t fully credit GuliKit for the excellent ergonomics afforded by the Xbox-inspired shape, we can award points for the sturdy materials used and nailing a well-balanced weight. </p><p>The controller provides exhaustive customizability options, too. You can swap button layouts, program macros, and cycle through preset levels of rumble intensity and trigger sensitivity (which may not apply when using it with the Switch, as it doesn’t support analog triggers). However, managing these settings is less than ideal, as you can only change them by inputting button combinations. Sure, the combos are simple, but memorizing them all is challenging. Thankfully, GuliKit clearly spells everything out in the comprehensive manual you’ll receive with the gamepad.</p><p>It’s worth noting that GuliKit recently released a <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1222182.html">KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1130420.html">KingKong 3 Max</a>. The KingKong 3 Pro builds upon the premium controller by adding four slots for detachable rearward buttons or paddles (two come in the box) and a 1,000Hz polling rate for improved responsiveness. The KingKong 3 Max is similar but includes three pairs of back buttons (including short and long styles) and a 10-minute macro recording limit (versus 10 seconds on the KingKong 3 Pro). There’s also a dedicated trigger mode switch, RGB lights around the analog sticks that signal which sensitivity mode you’re in, and NFC for Amiibo support.</p><p><h3> A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</h3></p><div><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller comes with its own charging dock, features remappable controls, and is compatible with the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and Windows PCs thanks to its Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity. Unlike the 2.4GHz-only version, it features drift-free Hall effect sticks.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls and customizable back paddles. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p><p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p><p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list. </p><p><h3>A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h3></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="cNNs5L" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B0CSPHXJYM/?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo Pro 2</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->50</span></p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 offers many of the same features as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller but at a lower price point and with a DualShock-style layout. It features extra triggers, hand grips, remappable buttons, and back paddles, as well as the ability to pair with a range of devices via Bluetooth.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power: </strong>Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Android-Raspberry/dp/B08XY8H9D5?tag=theverge02-20">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387041/overwatch-2-review-new-battle-pass-heroes-maps"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.</p><p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo’s Ultimate software</a>&nbsp;on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;for $50 (or $54.99 if you want the incredibly cool&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-controller-for-switch-pc-macos-android-steam-raspberry-pi-special-edition">translucent purple</a>&nbsp;version).</p><p><h3>An adapter that lets you use your own controllers</h3></p><div><p>8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 looks like a flash drive, but once connected to your Switch’s dock, it enables you to wirelessly pair it with a number of older PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo controllers.</p></div><p>There are many <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/7/18068220/gbros-wireless-adapter-gamecube-controller-nintendo-switch">other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/24/16533008/nintendo-switch-gamecube-controller-support-update">devices</a> that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF?tag=theverge02-20">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p><p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p><p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR?tag=theverge02-20">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p><p><h3>Other Switch controllers you should know about</h3></p><div><ul><li>We like CRKD’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href="https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</li><li>We recently tested the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($49.99) for consideration. It offers many of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 2 Pro — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</li><li>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B08DRRJBC6?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</li></ul></div><p><em><strong>Update, June 28th:</strong> Updated to include details on several new models, including the Gamesir T4 Cyclone Pro and PowerA’s GameCube Style Wireless Controller.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Amazon Games has many projects in the pipeline, but the two biggest ones are the next Tomb Raider game and the Lord of the Rings MMO, both of which are produced in partnership with franchises owned by the Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Those are massive IPs that may well interest millions of fans. However, it's been a while since we heard about any of those. The new Tomb Raider game was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> to be in production (with Epic's Unreal Engine 5) in April 2022, while the publishing deal with Amazon was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in December of that year. As for the Lord of the Rings MMO (which Amazon was making before the deal <a href="https://wccftech.com/lord-of-the-rings-mmo-canceled-due-to-contractual-dispute-between-tencent-and-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell through with Tencent</a> and had to be renegotiated with the Embracer Group once the latter company acquired Middle-earth Enterprises), the game was only <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about briefly in May 2023</a>.</p>
<p>When can players expect to see them? According to Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann, recently interviewed <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Variety</a>, it shouldn't be that long, although neither project will be rushed.</p>
<p><em>It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away. As I said, we’re getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games. That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now… It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That’s doesn’t work. It has to be Triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.</em></p>
<p>We've heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that Tomb Raider specifically should be released in less than a year, featuring an open world that protagonist Lara Croft will traverse with her motorcycle. If that's the case, a reveal at Gamescom or The Game Awards at the latest makes sense.</p>
<p>With Tomb Raider, Amazon is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing a new TV series for Prime Video.</a>&nbsp;Earlier rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the universe would be connected between the games and the live action, but Christoph Hartmann seemed to dispel that notion in the Variety interview.</p>
<p><em>Obviously, we want to work much closer together, and we’ll be working much closer together with the different entertainment areas Amazon has and a very natural one is Prime Video. You see it with “Tomb Raider,” where we’re gonna have a “Tomb Raider” game coming and they’re doing a show. And some people say, “Oh, will they be linked together?” And I give them the example, look at “Spider-Man.” There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that. So it does not need to be always that everything is mingled together, but it’s really one brand, which really just shows for me why transmedia nowadays is so important, and how games is such a vital part.</em></p>
<p>As for the Lord of the Rings MMO, it may well be too late for that project to be intertwined with the TV series (which is getting its second season soon). As a reminder, we don't know much about this game other than it'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-very-different-from-new-world-will-use-a-next-gen-version-of-its-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">based on an enhanced version of the New World engine</a>, albeit with different priorities due to the specific intellectual property.</p>
<p>Overall, Hartmann said Amazon now has eight games in development, with the publisher aiming to get two or three out in a given year. This year's titles are probably <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (out on September 17 on PC and consoles) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World: Aeternum</a> (slated for October 15 on PC and consoles). Amazon also announced deals to publish Bandai Namco Online's Blue Protocol (although the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is in a dire financial situation</a> and the game hasn't been mentioned by Amazon press releases in a long while), the next games <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Glowmade</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-to-publish-disruptive-games-multiplayer-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disruptive Games</a>, and Maverick Games, and two projects in development at the internal <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-amazon-montreal-studio-new-multiplayer-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montréal</a> and Bucharest studios.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/megan-thee-stallion-goes-full-weeb-in-%E2%80%98otaku-hot-girl%E2%80%99.914625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24188110/megan-thee-stallion-otaku-hot-girl-jujutsu-kaisen-yuji-itadori-gojo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7rUk10">Yuji Itadori might just be a high schooler fighting for his life in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24084825/anime-awards-2024-winners-list-jujutsu-kaisen-demon-slayer-chainsaw-man"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>anime</a>, but now he’s caught the attention of a global star IRL. Rapper <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24091333/megan-thee-stallion-hot-girl-anime-inuyasha">Megan Thee Stallion</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">official hot girl and anime lover</a> — shouts him out in a big way on her new album, <em>MEGAN</em>. Her song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USxIYOaIpig">Otaku Hot Girl</a>,” contains an introduction narrated by the English voice actor of Itadori and numerous references to <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>and other anime. </p>
<p id="Rxxtt3">Megan Thee Stallion released <em>MEGAN</em> on Friday. Fans quickly took note of the introduction of “Otaku Hot Girl,” which starts with a voiced introduction from Adam McArthur, the voice actor of Yuji Itadori in the English dub of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>in addition to <a href="https://x.com/lesbianmista/status/1806550400343880028">sampling a tune</a> from the anime. In the song, McArthur says in the voice of Itadori that he likes, “a tall woman with a nice big ass, like Grammy winner Megan Thee Stallion,” and references other characters from the series by name, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040106/usher-gojo-satoru-cosplay-jujutsu-kaisen-anime">like Gojo Satoru</a>. </p>
<p id="xDAODd">The introduction references a viral fan moment within the <em>Jujutsu Kaisen </em>fandom. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H80iK0EMq2Q">official English dub</a>, another character asks Itadori who his type is and he says, “A tall woman with a nice big ass. Just saying, Jennifer Lawrence.” Based on this, fans popularized the idea that Itadori would also have a crush on Megan, since she could be his type and because she is a known anime fan. In response, Adam McArthur shared an audio clip on X in 2021 where he rerecorded the line and replaced the name Jennifer Lawrence with Megan Thee Stallion. The clip later became popular and widely used on social media platforms like TikTok and the idea that Itadori could have a crush on Megan has become widely accepted by fans. And now, the track has prompted excitement among fans as people share viral <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaludiasays/video/7385414157027298591">reaction videos on TikTok</a>. </p>

<p id="nQ5uvO">But the song’s anime references aren’t limited to just Itadori, the lyrics also mention things like<em> </em>Gojo’s domain expansion powers and Sasuke from <em>Naruto</em>. However, the singer encountered trouble with this track. The musician said she had to rerecord the track a few days before the album release because she didn’t get clearance to use the characters’ names in her song. “I really hope y’all think this shit sound fire because I had to jump through 8 million hoops to get this shit,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@biran337/video/7384949254210506030">she said in an Instagram live</a>. </p>
<p id="gkhDji">The track oozes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054429/megan-thee-stallion-hiss-tokyo-ghoul-anime-meaning">Megan’s love for anime</a>. Still, the artist has had to deal with fans who think she’s a fake fan despite her repeated participation in several anime fandoms. In her years as a star, she has become known for her <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23940797/megan-thee-stallion-halloween-cosplay-anime-taste-death-the-kid">incredible cosplays</a> and referenced <em>Naruto</em> in one of her breakout hits, “Girls in the Hood.”  Now, this song allows her to respond to skeptics. In one line she talks about how she won’t be bothered by people with anime avatars online. She sings, “I’m not finna argue with a Sasuke avi/Incel mad, I’m a weeb and a baddie.” </p>
<p id="HTdCvX">So if you want to rock out to some anime-inspired lyrics “Otaku Hot Girl” is out to listeners now. </p>

Sasko talked about how he felt that while <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was meant to portray a dystopian American future, and after traveling to the city more frequently in the years since the game launched in 2020, he didn’t feel they went hard enough on certain topics.</p><p>“I see that we didn’t push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance,” Sasko said. “Like, let’s say the homeless crisis, when I look at it, I’m like, we weren’t far enough in <em>‘77</em>. We thought that we were dystopian, but we just touched the surface.”</p><p><strong>Read more</strong>: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-new-ending-phantom-liberty-misty-v-lives-1850899228&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-new-ending-phantom-liberty-misty-v-lives-1850899228"><em>Phantom Liberty</em>’s New Ending Is The Perfect Coda To <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a></span></p><p>Dan Hernberg, executive producer on the <em>Cyberpunk </em>sequel, joked that <em>2077</em> had “one homeless person in a tent somewhere” and the team thought that was sufficient, only to be told by Americans that they’d need “a whole city” of people without homes in Night City to capture the homeless crisis in the country. Sasko says living in America has given him a better perspective on how prevalent these problems are.</p><p>“We thought like, ‘Oh yeah, we are being edgy’ with all that stuff,” Sasko said. “And I’m like, ‘my walk to the train every day is more edgy sometimes.’”</p><p>While <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s portrayal of systemic problems like homelessness are one thing, Sasko says that working on <em>Orion</em> in America will help them catch less drastic discrepancies, like <em>2077</em>’s manhole covers being the ones seen in Germany, rather than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-wrong-german-manhole-covers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-wrong-german-manhole-covers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the ones you’d see in American cities</a></span>.</p><p>“When you go to America, there’s things like hydrants, where they are placed and how they look,” Sasko said. “The street lights, the positions of that. The trash bins, they’re in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don’t see it almost anywhere, Like there’s so much nuance. [...] Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything’s just slightly different and it doesn’t break immersion, but it’s just that little thing you’re like, ‘Well, maybe this wasn’t like, you know, made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture.’”</p><p>As work on its post-launch patches and <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion have wrapped up, for the first time in a decade, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-nobody-working-cdpr-update-2024-orion-1851504802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-nobody-working-cdpr-update-2024-orion-1851504802">no one at CD Projekt RED is working on <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a></span>.
