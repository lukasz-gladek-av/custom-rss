Naturally, this being a bullet heaven shooter, you'll have access to tons of weaponry to help you do just that.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>is a bullet heaven shooter set in the, er, world of the <em>Postal </em>games.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Running With Scissors and Goonswarm are promising the ability to play as several Postal Dudes from throughout the franchise's history, and they've also packed <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>with "Easter eggs, references, and familiar faces for fans who know the chaos by heart".</p><p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Bullet Paradise </em>looks pretty similar to the likes of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/megabonk-sales-1m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dece44e2-9de8-42d4-8be9-cdc04699d879" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indie hit <em>Megabonk</em></a>, albeit from a first-person perspective; you'll battle waves of enemies, building synergies between weapons and abilities as you go.</p><p>Unfortunately, despite only being announced earlier today, <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>has already found itself at the center of a controversy surrounding its logo, with fans <a href="https://x.com/RWSstudios/status/1996223528698273970" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">alleging on social media</a> that the art is AI-generated, a claim that Running With Scissors has categorically denied.</p><p>Still, with AI use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="605cb384-a6e4-42b3-8104-b8d3cce6d299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">on the rise across the industry as a whole</a> and studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> wholeheartedly embracing it despite its controversies, it's not unreasonable for players to be hyper-vigilant about this sort of thing.</p>
<p>In any case, if you want to keep up with <em>Postal: Bullet Paradise </em>(which doesn't have a release date yet), you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162690/POSTAL_Bullet_Paradise?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam right here</a>.

Note that this feature isn't supported in Grand Prix races or in Knockout Tour.</p><p>Additionally, you'll now be able to see the name and source game for each of the music tracks that plays during <em>Mario Kart World</em> in the pause menu.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which reveals exactly how much of EA the Saudi Public Investment Fund will own after the recent acquisition goes through, and it turns out it's not an insignificant percentage.</p><p>According to a filing seen by the Wall Street Journal (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-will-own-93-4-percent-of-ea-after-buyout" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Developer</a>), the Saudi PIF will own 93.4% of EA following the buyout, with fellow purchasers Silver Lake and Affinity Partners scoring 5.5% and 1.1% of the publisher respectively.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, it was announced back in September that EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">would go private</a> thanks to a buyout from the three aforementioned companies, who acquired the storied publisher for an eye-watering $55 billion (although that's still not the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">most expensive gaming acquisition in history</a>, of course).</p><figure role="group">

<p>After the acquisition was announced, EA was quick to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners?utm_campaign=email-post&amp;r=2ov77y&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">assuage fears</a> that the new buyers would affect its creative direction, with the publisher claiming that it will "maintain creative control" after the purchase and that its "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact".</p><p>However, concerns remain around the involvement of the Saudi PIF in EA's business, especially given that its chair, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/20/man-who-bought-world/rights-abuses-linked-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">presided over</a> a number of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/projects/saudi-arabia-kingdom-of-repression/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">human rights abuses</a> in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Still, EA isn't the only pie in which the Saudi PIF has its proverbial fingers.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="878">If you work in photo or video editing, you already know that every extra bit of storage you can get your hands on feels like a lifesaver. Instead of deleting files you might eventually need, it’s almost always smarter to expand your storage capacity. That’s why compact external drives are so valuable. Stash away more data without taking up much space. And even though Black Friday has come and gone, that doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance to snag a great deal on an external SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, the SanDisk 2TB Creator Pro Portable SSD is discounted on Amazon well after the next big shopping rush</a>. Usually listed at $294, this rugged yet tiny SSD is currently available for just $240, which is a solid 18% off. If 2TB isn’t quite the amount you’re after—too large or not quite enough—both the 1TB (6% off) and 4TB (7% off) models are marked down as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="878">Fast Save and Load Times</h2>
<p data-start="880" data-end="1572">This small but powerful external SSD delivers remarkable performance considering its ultra-compact form factor. The “Creator Pro” branding is very intentional, signaling that it’s designed with professional creators in mind—those who rely on high-speed transfers to maintain their workflow. The SSD reaches impressive read speeds of 2,000 MB/s and write speeds of 2,000 MB/s, all while being only 2.5 inches in size. Small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="1592" data-end="1907">The SSD also features a built-in carabiner loop. You can literally clip up to that’s 4,000GB of storage right onto your keychain. Attach it to your backpack, your belt loop, or anything else it can hook onto, and your files can travel anywhere with you while staying safely protected.</p>
<p data-start="1909" data-end="2332">Of course, having your data be this mobile might also raise concerns about losing it. Misplacing your bag at a café could mean someone suddenly has access to a massive chunk of your personal or professional files. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry. The drive includes password protection with 256-bit AES hardware encryption, ensuring that your information stays completely locked down. Only you can access what’s inside.</p>


<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, you can save up to 18% on SanDisk’s portable SSD lineup for creators.</a> The 4TB version is discounted by 7% to $400, the 2TB version is 18% off at $240, and the 1TB model is 6% off at just $160. Come grab yours now before someone at SanDisk realizes Black Friday is over.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For a limited time, you also receive a month free subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. With this, you get access to Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and so many more applications that creators rely on.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Be sure to check out the other offerings in the SanDisk Creator Pro lineup. Also available are a USB-C flash drive, an SSD desk drive, a microSD card, a phone drive, and a standard SD card. Not all are currently on sale, but they are all available in the same, stylish sky blue—so that’s something.</p>

              <p>Good morning! Winter has hit my area of the country hard, and so I write this with cold fingers in a chilly basement office. Will I finally break down and turn on the heat? Stay tuned to find out. Anyway, my frozen digits and I welcome you to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we’ve got more layoffs, bad news for some<em> Battlefield 6</em> players, creepy horror game <em>Horses</em> getting banned from another store, and more.</p> <h2><em>MLB The Show</em> is getting a mobile port</h2> <p>PlayStation’s long-running baseball sim series,<em> MLB The Show</em>, is arriving on a new platform: your mobile phone. Well, assuming you live in the Philippines, <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">where the mobile port</a> is soft launching for a regional test.&nbsp; Meanwhile, PC players longing for a great baseball simulator watch on and shake their heads. Maybe one day, Sony and the MLB will remember to port <em>The Show</em> to computers.</p>

  <h2>Testing shows a <em>BF6</em> tank skin makes you take more damage</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pc1q3u/psa_do_not_use_the_mastery_50_ifv_or_mbt_skin_you/">A <em>Battlefield 6</em> player on Reddit posted a video that went viral</a> on the <em>BF6</em> subreddit. It shows that some tank and armored vehicle skins awarded to players who grind for hours are actually broken. Apparently, if you have these “Mastery” skins equipped, your vehicle will take more damage from RPGs and other explosives, making it much easier to destroy your tank. Yikes.</p>

 <p>A lot of players in the comments shared their own first-hand experiences using these skins and were happy to see this video seemingly proving that, no, they weren’t going mad, and in fact, their tanks were being blown up faster. Some players speculated that other vehicle skins in BF6 might have similar bugs and warned players from using any cosmetics on tanks until EA patches things up.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal lays off staff for the second time in 2025</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/">As first reported by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> on December 2, a number of developers shared on LinkedIn that they had been fired in what appears to be a new round of layoffs at the studio behind <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> and <em>Deus Ex Human Revolution.&nbsp;</em> According to sources who spoke to the outlet, most of the studio’s internal projects have been canned, and what remains is now focused on supporting Xbox-published games like the upcoming <em>Fable</em> and recently released <em>Grounded 2</em>. This is the second round of layoffs this year to hit the Embracer-owned studio. In April, 75 employees were laid off at Edios Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A game studio fighting AI allegedly requires artists to draw during interviews</h2> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mid-size-game-company-in-japan-asks-potential-recruits-to-draw-in-front-of-them-to-avoid-generative-ai-fraud/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em>,</a> an anonymous graphic designer at a mid-sized game studio in Japan told a local outlet that after hiring artists who had used AI to get the job and discovering they lacked the skills the team needed, they are now allegedly testing artists during the hiring process. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-japanese-game-studio-now-asks-art-applicants-to-draw-a-picture-during-the-interview-to-prove-they-dont-just-use-genai/">As translated by <em>VGC</em></a>, here’s what the dev said:</p>

 <p>“There are many people who claim that artwork generated by AI is their own creation. We’ve actually ended up hiring such people, only to find they weren’t productive, which led to several problems. Because of that, we’ve changed our hiring process and it now requires candidates to draw something in person during the interview to verify their skills. As a recruiter, it’s a huge hassle, and it feels like we’re going backwards in time, but I’ve heard that several other companies are doing the same thing.”</p> <h2><em>Horses</em> has now been banned from another storefront</h2> <p>On December 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Horses is now banned from being sold on Humble. This is the third storefront to ban the controversial horror game, following Steam and Epic’s refusal to allow it to be sold on either platform. Horses is out now on GOG, for now at least.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia is going to own almost all of EA after the deal closes</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate 4</em> update makes everybody look more tired and stoned</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">Amazon has removed that terrible AI-generated anime dub</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

<p>Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is already one of the wealthiest and most influential financial forces on the planet, and rumours of its interest in acquiring a major stake in Electronic Arts have been circulating for months. Now, newly surfaced information has clarified just how substantial that takeover may be.</p>



<p>For those who haven’t followed the developments, this move forms part of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/could-saudi-arabia-pif-want-larger-ownership-in-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saudi Arabia’s broader push</a> to grow its global footprint through high-profile investments. The PIF has poured billions into sport, gaming, entertainment, and media over recent years—and EA now appears to be the next major name in its sights.</p>

The remaining shares will be split between Silver Lake (5.5%) and Affinity (1.1%), making PIF the overwhelming majority owner by a huge margin.</p>



<p>The WSJ also states that the fund will need to contribute roughly $29 billion to complete the takeover—a staggering figure even by modern gaming industry standards. </p>







<p>Despite PIF’s dominant control, filing reports suggest EA will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retain full creative independence</a>. In theory, EA and its various teams will continue operating without interference in development decisions, future titles, or internal strategy.</p>



<p>Whether that promise holds true in the long term remains to be seen. Ownership changes of this scale often reshape companies in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. For now, all eyes will be on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how EA navigates the transition</a>—and what influence, if any, its new majority owner will ultimately exert.</p>

In truth, Geoff Keighley’s statue could relate to pretty much any video game with a demonic or hellish theme. That’s a lot of video games.

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed Shadows Nintendo Switch 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>1371748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that an Assassin’s Creed game is good. Admittedly, Assassin’s Creed Shadows was beset by development problems and missed its release date any number of times, but as a series, Assassin’s Creed has earned its place as one of gaming’s key tentpoles. Shadows was originally released earlier in 2025, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">proved to be another excellent action-adventure</a>, its Japanese setting opening up a new set of features for the long-running series. Now, it’s arriving on the Nintendo Switch 2, and we’ve had the opportunity to discover whether Ubisoft have managed to stuff the huge experience onto Nintendo’s latest hybrid console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzyD_EFZzgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s no getting away from the fact that you can immediately tell Assassin’s Creed Shadows is running on less powerful hardware, but what has been achieved with this port once again shows the level of polish that Ubisoft are capable of delivering and the adaptability of the Anvil engine. Just as with Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft have managed to bring across the core experience across in a deeply playable form by making smart decisions with regard to the visual nips and tucks they’ve had to make.</p>


<p>Clear signs include less-detailed floor textures, simplified water effects, static bodies of water, and mild pop-in, which seemed particularly prevalent in shadows. There’s also the tell-tale sign of anti-aliasing shimmer, and at times there’s a distinct line a few feet away from your character where it almost seems to present as screen tearing. That’s only visible under certain circumstances, though, and only when you’re not in motion.</p>


<p>All that considered, Assassin’s Creed Shadows still looks great on Switch 2. When the sunlight is shimmering through the trees, fronds of grass sway in the breeze, and fallen leaves shuffle underfoot, you can’t help but be impressed by the organic, vibrant world that Ubisoft have created. There’s baked in puddle reflections, which still carry a real sense of quality despite losing the ray tracing of the beefier consoles, while birds and beasts populate every scene, albeit with less definition than elsewhere. It looked incredible elsewhere, and still looks arresting here.</p>
<p>The real key is the frame rate. Assassin’s Creed Shadows aims for 30fps on Switch 2, and that does feel clearly slower and less immediate than its 60fps brethren. Depending on how sensitive you are to such things, that, in itself, might ruin the experience for you. It can dip from there at times too, especially through night scenes with an excess of burning flame effects such as in the opening battle, and even some of the cutscenes struggle to maintain a locked frame rate.</p>

<p>However, it mostly sits at or around 30fps, and in this context, that is a strong start. Given the continual patches we’ve seen for Star Wars Outlaws, you have to assume that Ubisoft will be refining the experience further in the coming weeks, but overall it’s absolutely playable at launch. It feels hugely impressive to have Assassin’s Creed Shadows in the palm of your hand, especially given the size and scope of the game, and I’ve really enjoyed returning to the world, even with the reduced graphical fidelity and lower frame rate. It was a good game originally, and it remains a good game now.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have the option of playing elsewhere, whether on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or PC, Assassin’s Creed Shadows does look, play and perform better. That said, you can’t carry those out the door, and the core experience remains in place on Switch 2, whether you’re playing docked or handheld.</p>

<p>If anything, this is a game that works remarkably well in handheld, as you complete the odd mission here or trek across the map there, breaking the game’s huge number of quests and side missions down into something more manageable. Thanks to Ubisoft Connect, you can also carry saves over across platforms, so if you want to double-dip, grabbing the game to continue on the go is well worth considering.</p>
<p>There is one underlying issue here at launch, and that’s crashes. I experienced a series of hard crashes after the first couple of hours with the game, but at intermittent points, so there was no clear trigger for them happening. Restarting my Nintendo Switch 2 seemed to remedy the issue, but I made sure to perform manual saves afterwards, just in case. Here’s hoping that a day-one patch will wipe out the issue, especially as I’ve not been the only player to experience them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the most significant flaws of Monster Hunter Wilds when it launched earlier this year was the low challenge level offered by the launch content. The general consensus on this issue wasn't fueled by the opinion of veteran players only. Myself, a hunter far from being a series veteran, found the game way too easy, and with the launch endgame not offering anything significantly challenging, I left the game behind, returning to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak</a> for my Monster Hunter fix. However, the game's producer claims that this issue has been resolved, urging lapsed players to return to the game.</p>



<p>Speaking at the PlayStation Partner Awards 2025 Japan Asia, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, producer Yuya Tokuda talked about the challenges of balancing the game for both newcomers and veterans. </p>



<p><em>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including Monster Hunter: World. We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armor. In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users,"</em> said Tokuda-san.</p>



<p>Following its release in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-late-june/">Monster Hunter Wilds received multiple updates</a>, which introduced <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">additional content and a revamped endgame offering more challenges to clear</a>. While the game's update cycle has yet to be completed and there's more to come before the obligatory big expansion, Tokuda-san believes the low difficulty launch issues have been addressed. </p>



<p><em>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again,"</em> the producer said.</p>



<p>As they say, first impressions last a lifetime, so it is understandable that many completed Monster Hunter Wilds and never returned to it due to the low challenge level and, more importantly, performance issues, which have yet to be fixed to this day.</p>



<p> Hopefully, the development team will be able to improve the game further and deliver a better experience in the future, as the new open-world progression, which modernized the experience considerably, is well worth experiencing.

            <title><![CDATA[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Was The Biggest New Third-Party Xbox Game Pass Launch in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-biggest-new-third-party-xbox-game-pass-launch-2025/</link>
            <guid>1371739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you were looking at the calendar, the week that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S with a day one launch on Xbox Game Pass, considering the fact that this was Sandfall Interactive's debut title, and (though you may not have known it at the time) it would be competing with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, you'd be forgiven for thinking Clair Obscur didn't have a strong shot at standing out that week.</p>



<p>Not only was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-shadow-drop-actually-helped-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Oblivion Remastered's shadow-dropping in no way a hindrance</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">but according to Xbox Wire,</a> it became, and would remain, the biggest new third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass in 2025.</p>



<p>You might have some conspiratorial thinking around that news, thinking that Xbox started tracking this metric to jump on the Clair Obscur hype even more as we inch closer to The Game Awards and the feeling that gaming's modern zeitgeist has already dubbed Clair Obscur to be the game of 2025 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">especially after its sweep at the Golden Joysticks</a>), but this is actually something that <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/31/palworld-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever/">Xbox began tracking only last year</a>, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-is-now-the-most-popular-game-on-xbox-game-pass/">Palworld became the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass ever</a>.</p>



<p>And, in fairness, considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCy6vC00O0c&amp;t=1s">Clair Obscur's appearance in January's Developer_Direct video</a> is at least partial proof that Xbox has been behind the Clair Obscur hype for a long time now.</p>



<p>The size of the launch is measured by the number of unique users who played the game within its first 30 days of availability, which means that in its first month of release, when the whole industry seemed consumed by the Clair Osbcur craze, a lot of players rushed to Xbox Game Pass to see what all the fuss was about.</p>



<p>"<em>This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it’s down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality</em>," said Sandfall Interactive creative director, Guillaume Broche, in an Xbox Wire post. "<em>It’s really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream</em>."</p>



<p>Broche also noted that Sandfall Interactive's working with Xbox and releasing on Game Pass was a key element to getting the word out about Clair Obscur. "<em>From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the Developer_Direct video in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Letting a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before. The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first</em>."</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year</a>, he gave it a 9.5/10 and pegged it as a potential Game of the Year candidate. Fast forward to today and not only did it sweep The Golden Joysticks, winning seven awards (including Ultimate Game of the Year), <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">but it has 12 nominations at The Game Awards</a>, and could very well repeat its Golden Joysticks performance. </p>

              <p>Earlier this week, a post on the official <i>No Man’s Sky</i> subreddit highlighted what clearly looks like some digital theft. Some premium cosmetics sold via a loot box in the free-to-play survival game <i>Once Human</i> look virtually identical to teleporters in space exploration game <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p> <p>While a circular object that can teleport someone has been a staple of science fiction since at least the film <i>Stargate</i>, the more you look at these two 3D assets, the more similarities you’ll spot; they’re virtually indistinguishable save for a different color theme. Managing director for <i>NMS </i>dev Hello Games, Sean Murray, was one of the many internet denizens who took note (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). Though instead of expressing outrage, he’s taken a more playful approach, pointing out an oversight in the original design.</p>

 <p>“Jokes on them” <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?s=20">Murray wrote on X</a>, “we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅 <a href="https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas">https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas</a> <a href="https://t.co/KXRD3F5X1i">pic.twitter.com/KXRD3F5X1i</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So if the assets are indeed ripped from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, it will come with some very unoptimized geometry for <i>Once Human</i> to wrestle with.</p>

 <h2>The heck is a LOD?</h2> <p>“LOD” stands for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a>.” Various objects in any given 3D game will have different LODs depending on how far away from the object a viewer is. The further you are, the less detail there is on the object. This aids in rendering and stress on the machine producing the geometry. There’s no sense in having a fully detailed 3D object if you’re many miles away. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/w0bKkGqV5JQ">a video demonstrating the technique</a> in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>:</p>

  <p>So next time you’re playing a massive open-world game, now you know why objects look a little funny from a vast distance—especially if you’re playing <i>Once Human</i> and looking at some allegedly stolen assets.</p>

 <p><b><i>Updated; 12/3/2025, 11:20 a.m. ET:</i></b></p> <h2><em>Once Human</em> devs removing the asset, conducting a ‘thorough review’</h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/no-mans-sky-asset-accusation">a statement to <i>PCGamesN</i></a>, <i>Once Human</i>’s devs stated they are taking the allegations “very seriously and want everyone to feel confident in the creative work that goes into the game.” They continued:</p> <blockquote><p>With this in mind, we will replace the asset in question. We are undertaking a thorough review and will be using this moment to strengthen our internal art and design policies. We genuinely appreciate the community members who brought this to our attention. This feedback helps us improve.</p></blockquote> <p>As <i>PCGamesN</i> notes, <i>Once Human</i> has been accused of using assets based on other games before, such as Caveira’s symbol from <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i>. Maybe they’ve finally learned their lesson now?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, 2025, a full year after it dropped on Xbox and PC platforms. It arrives on PlayStation 5 along with all the upgrades and enhancements that have been applied over the last twelve months, which means players flying the blue banner are getting a ‘better product’ than when the game first launched in 2024.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with STALKER 2 since it dropped on PlayStation 5, getting to grips all over again with one of my top games of 2024. In my first STALKER 2 review, I said, ‘I cannot dredge up a single reason why you shouldn’t invest in STALKER 2,’ but is that still true after a year of evolution and the game launching on a new platform?</p>



<p>To find out, read on and explore my full STALKER 2 PS5 review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-stalker-2-worth-it-on-ps5">Is STALKER 2 Worth It On PS5?</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 had a fair few issues when it was released in 2024. It needed some serious upkeep, and in the weeks that followed the launch, GSC Game World applied many fixes and patches to address the game’s biggest concerns. It stabilized, and hundreds of thousands of people poured into the game over the next year or so.</p>



<p>Today, STALKER 2 isn’t too much of a different beast, but enough has been done for it to finally feel much more polished. The game’s unique elements, like the ‘A-Life’ AI engine that was promised ahead of launch, still aren’t where they should be, but it’s a sight better than it was when it dropped on Xbox and PC in November 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar, STALKER 2 throws players into a harrowing, harsh post-apocalyptic environment called The Zone. It’s worth stressing that the rest of the world is mostly fine, it’s just The Zone that’s post-apocalyptic. This irradiated, mutant-infested space surrounds Chornobyl, the ill-fated nuclear power plant found in Ukraine.</p>



<p>In STALKER 2, players must contend with the threats of The Zone, both human-based and mutated, to uncover shocking revelations, align with or dispute against factions, and resolve the protagonist’s story and reason for being there in the first place.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty challenging game, and at times, it has been compared to the likes of Escape from Tarkov and Fallout, which is mostly accurate. Imagine if Fallout were set in Russia and you’re basically there.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 represents hours of gaming wrapped up in an attractive package. There’s a solid story there that takes players across a massive, mixed map, presenting them with plenty of weapons, outfits, and equipment items to get to grips with.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>worth </strong>the investment to secure a copy on PlayStation 5, but let’s go a little deeper.</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-is-better-than-ever">STALKER 2 is Better Than Ever</h2>



<figure><figcaption>‘Gorgeous’ isn’t the word</figcaption></figure>







<p>I’ve already sunk many hours into STALKER 2 on PlayStation 5, and I can attest to it being better than ever. My first review in 2024 was glowing, but the PS5 release takes things to the next level. It’s a marvel of a thing to come back to a game an entire year later and be presented with almost a different version, and the comparisons are pretty easily made.</p>



<p>The overall optimization of STALKER 2 has been improved; it runs better and smoothly, and there are fewer bugs throughout. New quests, UI elements, customization options, and details have been added over the last year, and some nice-to-have features like an ‘immersive mode’ are now present.</p>



<p>Even on the PS5 Slim, not even a PS5 Pro, the game looks phenomenal. The vistas in this game are something special to behold, and the weather effects, physics, and sound engine are all on point. This game has one of the best dynamic weather engines I’ve ever seen in a game, and it lacks much of a backing soundtrack, so the ambience immerses you to the max when you’re walking around The Zone.</p>



<p>The game’s difficulty balancing can be a little skewed at times, but it’s plenty forgiving if you play on a lower difficulty.</p>



<p>My favorite thing in STALKER 2 has to be the combat. Whether you’re fighting the game’s more fearsome mutants or the many human enemies that roam The Zone, you’re in for a treat. Combat is versatile and pretty dynamic, and everything from stealth to all-out guns blazing feels viable.</p>



<p>Talking about roaming The Zone, you’ll also have a great time digging through all the nooks and crannies of this game. It’s packed with secrets, collectables, side missions, and ad-hoc objectives that pop up as you probe the wider map. The world-building is phenomenal, and the atmosphere created in some environments is to die for… Literally.</p>



<p>We should also be getting some kind of expansion in the future, too, so if you get it, you’ll have more to look forward to down the line. GSC Game World is not finished with STALKER 2 by any means.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-4-great">Verdict: 4 – Great</h2>



<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl represents many hours of entertaining (if a little morbid at times) gameplay for anyone fond of the post-apocalyptic settings found in the likes of Fallout and Metro. It’s a stunning game that might present some issues at times, but GSC Game World has worked hard to optimise it over the last year or so.</p>



<p>It remains one of my favorite games in the genre, and I’d take a third playthrough in a shot, especially if GSC ever implements a more major update or some kind of expansion.</p>

                <p>According to one analyst, Call of Duty as a franchise is "underperforming" in 2025 due to a variety of factors. Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics said in an interview that some of the factors that he believes are contributing to Call of Duty's decline include "community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition."</p><p>In terms of the competition, Elliott called out Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, along with Fortnite, which recently had a popular Simpsons season and launched its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">positively received Chapter 7.</a></p><p>"Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elliott told Eurogamer</a>. "Attention is scarce."</p><p>Elliott went on to say that players are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Call of Duty's "lack of innovation." Prior to Black Ops 7's release, Elliott said people would buy Black Ops 7 even if they complained about a lack of innovation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">because many people buy new Call of Duty games yearly as part of "autopilot" purchasing.</a> Elliott also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">predicted that Black Ops 7 would outsell Battlefield 6</a>, but he made this prediction prior to the release of both games.</p><p>Elliott also pointed out that Call of Duty's turn toward more "Fortnite-like cosmetics" and "non-military character skins" like Beavis and Butthead and Nicki Minaj has "alienated a significant portion of the fanbase who prefer a more grounded military aesthetic."</p><p>For what it's worth, Black Ops 7 does not feature the same kind of wacky and over-the-top skins that Black Ops 6 had, in part because Activision said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/" data-ref-id="1100-6534614">heard the concerns that Call of Duty had strayed from its identity</a>. Warzone, however, still has all of those kinds of skins.</p><p>For Black Ops 7 specifically, Elliott said the game's co-op campaign was a "major point of criticism," while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">the game's use of "AI slop"</a> was a sore spot for some.</p><p>"Player reception was [also] largely negative, with a mostly negative Steam user score and review bombing galore. Long-standing player frustrations, like the perceived impact of skill-based matchmaking--and the focus on heavy microtransactions (skins and bundles) over core gameplay quality, continue to drive players away from the franchise," he added.</p><p>Additionally, Elliott said Black Ops 7 launching into Game Pass "cannibalized traditional full-price game sales" for Xbox and PC. He pointed to the reporting that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">Black Ops 6 missed out on $300 million in potential sales</a> due to the game being on Game Pass.</p><p>"Our estimates have signaled time and time again that Game Pass cannibalizes game revenues--and Call of Duty is no different," he said.</p><p>Beyond all of this, Elliott said the marketing for Black Ops 7 was "pretty abysmal and underwhelming," while the game's formal reveal event at Call of Duty Next was "messy and did little to excite the community."</p><p>"This is again in stark contrast to the community-driven, focused marketing of Battlefield and Arc, whose development and marketing has been incredibly community-driven," he said.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">sold more than 10 million copies</a>, reportedly, but there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-reported-black-ops-7-regional-sales-numbers-are-unimpressive/1100-6536468/" data-ref-id="1100-6536468">no sales data available yet for Black Ops 7</a>. Any comparison would be incomplete and unfair, as Black Ops 7 is on Game Pass and is available on more platforms than Battlefield 6. No shooter has outsold Call of Duty in terms of full-year in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">since 2006</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">Battlefield 6 has already eclipsed the first-month sales of Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3.</a></p>

            <p>Amazon's upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Pheobe Waller-Bridge will interconnect with the video games, rather than being a standalone story with its own continuity in the vein of the Angelina Jolie films.</p>
<p>This latest nugget of Tomb Raider-laced information comes from Story Kitchen, a production company tied to the series.</p>

<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects/tombraider">company's website</a>, and spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/infinityTRaider">Infinity Tomb Raider</a>, the deal between Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM studios "will reinvent the franchise on a massive scale, interconnecting a new live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe".</p>
<p>Along with the show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon's game department is also assisting on the next mainline Tomb Raider entry with developer Crystal Dynamics</a>. Story Kitchen's wording here could therefore suggest that whichever comes first - the show or the game - will perhaps lead into the other somehow, or at least drop some clues at what Tomb Raider fans can perhaps expect from the franchise's future.</p><p>It will also be interesting to see how Amazon's interconnecting of the games will differ from what Netflix did with its own Tomb Raider animated series, The Legend of Lara Croft. This series took place after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">brief  flashbacks to Lara's time on Yamatai from the 2013 reboot</a>. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Jonah and Sam from this trilogy of games make an appearance in Netflix's Tomb Raider animated series</a>.</p>
<p>However, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, we are yet to find out which other characters from the Tomb Raider series more generally will be popping up in Amazon's live-action adventure. Will Turner's Lara also meet those from earlier games such as Jonah? Or even someone like Werner Von Croy, Lara's former mentor who popped up in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>? </p>
<p>The wording from Story Kitchen doesn't make it totally clear which games, past or future, it will be unifying. It's unclear if the company is referring to Amazon and Crystal Dynamics' new game in the franchise, or if it will be canon with previous games in the series.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">actor Martin Bobb-Semple was cast in Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series</a>, but as who remains to be seen (though, some have speculated he will play tech-expert Zip).</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear more information about Amazon's Tomb Raider series and game soon!</p>

            <p>Antireal, the artist at the heart of a plagiarism scandal involving Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, has posted a statement on social media indicating the saga has come to a close.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal posted the following tweet</a>: "The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction." There has been no follow-up by Antireal elaborating on the situation, nor has any statement been released <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">on the official Marathon social media account</a>.</p>
<p>This appears to be the end of Marathon's plagiarism woes. Some, responding to Antireal's statement, are speculating that it was made as part of a deal between Antireal and Bungie / Sony. However, this has not been verified.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Antireal first posted a lengthy breakdown</a> of where their art appeared in Marathon's first public Closed Beta back in May of this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Following this, Bungie announced an investigation into the matter</a>, eventually admitting that yes, Antireal's art had been used during the development of Marathon. Following this controversy as well as the mixed reception to its initial beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale at Bungie was reportedly in freefall</a>, though it is worth noting vast changes have been made to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">in the run up to its release in March, 2026</a>.</p><p>Marathon's cinematic short director also chipped in last month, stating in now-deleted social media posts that the plagiarism scandal was "blown out of proportion". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-not-ai-oscar-winning-marathon-cinematic-short-director-hits-back-at-online-accusations">pushed back passionately against claims that AI was used in the creation of the frankly fantastic looking cinematic he directed</a>.</p>

            <p>
Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione's first-person narrative horror Horses has received a last-minute ban from the Epic Games Store. Epic was one of several storefronts confirmed to have approved a build for release when news of Horses' ban from Steam emerged, but it has now reversed its decision, citing what Santa Ragione calls "broad and demonstrably incorrect claims".
</p>
<p>
Horses unfolds across 14 days on a farm where humans are held captive as "horses", using the imagery to explore what Santa Ragione describes as "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility". Last week, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">revealed Steam had refused to distribute Horses</a> - citing concerns around an early, unfinished build, and declining to reappraise the game once it was finished. Despite Valve's rejection, Horses was approved for distribution on all other major PC storefronts, but Epic has now made an eleventh hour reversal.

<p>
In an <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">FAQ discussing the U-turn</a> on its website, Santa Ragione says it received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release, the storefront explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content" - saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", that "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated". On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.
</p><p>
Epic noted Santa Ragione had several options, including updating Horses to ensure compliance and resubmitting it for review. However, the studio says Epic did not specifically highlight the content it had found objectionable, nor would it have been possible to make significant changes so close to launch.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Santa Ragione chose to immediately appeal Epic's decision, addressing each of the storefront's concerns. It noted the "four brief" sex scenes featured in Horses - two occurring "mainly off camera" - are censored using pixellation, use "stylised and unrealistic" animations, and do not involve involve genitalia. As to Epic's other point, Santa Ragione stressed Horses "does not promote abuse (including animal abuse)" and is rather a "strong critique of violence and abuse in general." It also reiterated that its own IARC submission - filed "more than five weeks" before release - resulted in PEGI 18 and ESRB M ratings, as displayed on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic's Horses page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione says it then received an automated response from Epic 12 hours later rejecting its appeal, with the storefront insisting it had determined its original decision was "appropriately applied and will remain in place". It remains unclear what prompted Epic's apparent decision to instigate a last-minute re-review of Horses; Santa Ragione insists the storefront had received and reviewed a build two months ago, with its final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch. Eurogamer has contacted Epic for comment on the story.
</p>
<p>
Horses continues to be available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a> and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a>, where it costs £4.99/$4.99. Epic's decision has temporarily impacted its availability on Humble, but Santa Ragione says it's received confirmation from Humble that it will still be distributing the game - although a build is yet to go live.
</p><p>If you're curious about Horses itself, I reviewed it earlier this week ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">awarding it four out of five stars</a> and calling it a "rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves".

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/helldivers-2-pc-install-size-tiny-smaller/</link>
            <guid>1371676</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is about to get much, much smaller on PC, as Arrowhead (with some help from PlayStation’s Nixxes) have worked hard to squish the game’s install down by a staggering 85%! That’s huge news for PC players… and those that just have the game installed, but haven’t actually played it in a while.</p>
<p>Available now as a beta update, this reduces the PC installation size from ~154GB to just ~23GB, a completely ridiculous reduction in size. You’ll still be on the same build of the game, just without taking up so much space. Neat!</p>


<p>How is this possible? Well, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english">in a blog post recently</a>, Arrowhead addressed the issue of the game’s installation on PC and how much bigger it was than the PS5 version of the game. The reason for the difference was that, while the PS5 is guaranteed to have an SSD, Arrowhead thought that they needed to duplicate files to keep loading times down for PC gamer playing from a traditional mechanical HDD. After the reduction in size, Arrowhead believe that mission loading times for HDD players will be increased by just a few seconds in the worst cases.</p>
<p>All of this is because Arrowhead had relied on industry data for this assumption on data duplication – a practice that has been common to aid in random read times for any kind of spinning disc media. After exploring this in tandem with Nixxes and gathering real data specific to this game (such as that only 11% of players were playing from HDD), they discovered that the majority of loading times are actually from level generation as opposed to asset loading, meaning they could safely de-duplicate game assets, as asset loading happens in parallel.</p>

<p>While testing has been very positive internally, Arrowhead is still being cautious and hosting this as a beta alongside the main version, before reversing the roles and putting the huge version of Helldivers 2 as a legacy version to help with troubleshooting. However, given the minor differences, they won’t maintain this forever.</p>

            <p>Bloody waiters. Asking you what you'd like to eat after you waltz into the restaurant at which they're employed. The absolute cheek of it. Why can't they just ingest my money and spit a vaguely edible chocolate bar out of their belly button? This is the central philosophy which serves as the "touchstone" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> and its protagonist, Judas.</p>
<p>Yep, there's another <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/02/judas-developers-ghost-story-games-discuss-the-origins-of-its-main-character/">dev blog</a> out for the BioShocky FPS in which you'll run around a colony ship and gradually force someone to dislike you so much they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioshock-successor-judas-emerges-from-hiding-as-ken-levine-explains-how-youll-choose-the-games-final-villain">go full villain</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This time, Levine and co focus on the game's protagonist, who's called Judas. No, not the dude from the last supper, Judas is a lady who's lived her life on the game's spaceship, The Mayflower, and has had a lot of bad experiences interacting with its inhabitants. She also isn't a fan of going out for dinner.</p>
<p>As Levine recalls, when the team were trying to nail down just who Judas would be as a character, he was out for a run and cam,e up with a "speech" she might give. Said speech came to form "the touchstone we kept coming back to for the character and ultimately the entire game", and it went as follows:</p>
<blockquote>I only eat at vending machines, because I don’t like interacting with waiters. Restaurants are more complicated: there are greetings and "hellos" and "Is this table okay?" And I’m thinking, "Why should I care what you recommend? You’re not me!" But I’m not supposed to say that, so I just have to count the seconds until the interaction can end, devise socially acceptable ways of saying "Go f*** yourself." Because for me, conversation is a prelude to failure. Vending machines never ask me a question that I don’t know the answer to. The exchange is reduced to the transaction: money in, product out. Why can’t people be more like that?”</blockquote>
<p>Basically, Judas likes machines more than people. As someone who gets a bit of social anxiety when chatting to strangers, I get it, though I can't say I feel fuck off levels of strongly about waiters who're just politely trying to find me a table. According to Ghost Story Games, it's the "tension" between the robot-heavy sci-fi setting playing into Judas' hands, while her inability to play by societal rules leaves her a "pariah" or "outlaw" that forms the centre of the game, which its creators have taken to calling a "Judas Simulator".</p><p>The devs also stress that Judas' deep connection to the game's setting sets her apart from BioShock and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> leads Jack and Booker DeWitt, both of whom are strangers infiltrating unfamiliar worlds. I'm keen to see just how well that familiarity's played, with Ghost Story art director Nathan Phail-Liff's description of The Mayflower as being layered with history reflecting the twists and turns of the society inhabiting it over the years. Systems are being leaned on to manage the enivronment design in a fashion that means not everything'll be handcrafted, which'll be impressive if Ghost Story have pulled it off, but I'm slightly concerned could also imbue the game with the sterile coldness which can seep into game worlds which lean on tech like procedural generation particularly hard.</p>
<p>Breathtaking and twisted underwater city Rapture's the main thing that regularly pulls me back into BioShock, so here's hoping The Mayflower can capture some of that magic. If it does, I can't see my divergence from Judas' hardline waiter stance being a stumbling block.</p>

              <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a world where AI is increasingly sneaking into our games. Free-to-play multiplayer Steam hit <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is one of the latest examples, using an LLM-based chatbot for many of its NPCs that players can talk with. Or flirt with. Or “socially” engineer into completing quests without actually doing the work by talking to them like Solid Snake.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-leaper-kill-spaceport-trials-into-the-fray-2000649665">Open-World RPG <i>Where Winds Meet</i> Has It All: Evil Geese, AI Chatbots, And A $40,000 Skin</a></p> <p>Developed by Chinese-based Everstone Studio, <i>Where Winds Meet</i> is a veritable Mulligan stew of countless modern gaming conventions, as well as AI NPCs that trade scripted, canned lines of dialogue for, in theory anyway, a more dynamic and unpredictable experience. Others might describe it as lifeless. I’m inclined to agree, but the tech isn’t without its amusing quirks and exploits. One such player seems to have proven this by flirting with the tech until it…well, it did something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pd0pgi/removed_by_moderator/?embed_host_url=https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">raunchy enough for a Reddit mod to take it down</a> (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/where-winds-meet-ai-npc-flirting-reply/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>).</p> <p>Though the screenshot taken by Reddit user Oglokes24 is now in horny jail, we can glean some context clues from the comments. The flirting seemed to involve Okglokes24 lying to an NPC to say that “her husband died” and, well, whatever it was, one user replied: “You should be locked up.” “Sex minigame when?” reads another comment. “Ban incoming,” states another.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Oglokes24 about the contents of the now-deleted screenshot.</p> <h2>AI…Chatbots?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/chatgpt-ai-discord-clyde-chatbot-exploit-jailbreak-1850352678">Since LLMs hit the web</a>, folks have been finding all sorts of ways to trick them into doing things they’re not supposed to. Insert that tech into a game, and it’s no surprise that people are finding ways to get it to do things it’s not really supposed to. That includes some clever players realizing that if you talk to <i>Where Winds Meet</i>’s AI chatbots as Solid Snake would, by restating various phrases back to the NPC as a question, you can bypass certain quest win conditions.</p> <p>In a Reddit post documenting the so-called “<i>Metal Gear</i> method” (<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/where-winds-meet/npc-chatbots-gaming">h/t <i>PCGamesN</i></a>), a user was able to end a quest just by rephrasing everything the NPC said back as a question.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000650075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650075"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650075">© Screenshot: Everstone Studio / Hakkix</figcaption></figure> <p>Based on comments from other players, the tech behind these pseudo-sentient NPCs isn’t as sophisticated as something like ChatGPT, so it’s a bit easier to find ways to screw with it. While I admit the prospect of interacting with NPCs via natural language is neat, I certainly am unwilling to trade thoughtful, well-written characters for this junk.</p>

<p>I’ve never been a huge mobile gamer, but I can fully appreciate that it makes up a <strong>massive </strong>portion of our industry. In recent years, mobile games have become increasingly intelligent, and AAA titles are finding their way onto mobile devices both natively and via cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that, if you want to enjoy mobile gaming as much as possible, you’ll want a solid controller with which to do so. That’s where the BACKBONE ONE comes in, an innovative, handy, and powerful little device that holds your phone and provides a solid base on which to build a strong mobile gaming experience.</p>



<p>I’ve been trialling the BACKBONE ONE for a couple of weeks and have been nothing but impressed. Here’s my full BACKBONE ONE review.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-backbone-one-worth-99-99">Is The BACKBONE ONE Worth $99.99?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing this BACKBONE ONE review, the device was selling for $99.99. I’d picked up the ultra-limited Death Stranding 2 edition, which came in a fabulous themed box and boasted a unique shell that’s to die for, but the standard is much more accessible and easier to find online.</p>



<p>As I write this, the <a href="https://backbone.com/pages/death-stranding-2-le">Death Stranding 2 edition</a> is fully sold out, but BACKBONE has teased that another wave might arrive soon. If you’re a fan, you’ll want to secure one of these, as it’s a gorgeous item to have in your collection, even if you don’t actively play mobile games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>My BACKBONE ONE Death Stranding 2 Edition is a beautiful thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Now, to the BACKBONE ONE review.</p>



<p>The BACKBONE ONE is a relatively simple thing that works right out of the box with almost no setup required. You simply pull it apart, insert your mobile device, and snap it closed again. It has a USB-C connection (or a Lightning connection) built into the device, which means it works with almost all modern devices.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market and looking to make known your allegiances, you’ll be happy to know you can purchase the BACKBONE ONE in both an Xbox or PlayStation-based theme.</p>



<p>It basically takes your phone and turns it into a cheap, portable gaming device, which, when paired with something like Game Pass, becomes a formidable thing. It’s small but mighty, and while the inputs and the overall form factor are pretty tiny compared to something like an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-powerhouse-portable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, it’s perfect for gaming on the go.</p>



<p>In recent years, BACKBONE has evolved this device, and now, there’s a handy app, more responsive inputs, magnetic adapters that ensure a better fit for a wider range of devices, and more tactile buttons. There’s even a nice 3.5mm headset jack on the side if you want to game on a train or while sitting in an Uber.</p>



<p>It really is that simple.</p>



<p>I’d say it’s worth $99.99, without a doubt. If you want to game while travelling and don’t want to splash out almost $1,000 on a top-tier handled gaming device, this is where you’ll want to get involved. It weighs almost nothing, shrinks down into the tiniest space in your backpack (or even a pocket), and it looks nice.</p>



<p>It’s also durable, which I’ve tested by aggressively pulling it open and shut again and dropping it a few times. There’s very little in the way of working parts inside the BACKBONE ONE, so you don’t have to worry about it being devastated by a slip of the hand. Just try to make sure your phone isn’t in it when you do drop it, because that’s not guaranteed to be protected.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing I can complain about, it’s that my ‘armoured’ phone protector couldn’t fit properly in the BACKBONE ONE as the charging port was a bit obscured, but that’s a ‘me’ problem.</p>



<p>I’d recommend the BACKBONE ONE if you want to game on the go on the cheap; it’s that simple.</p>







<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your favorite mobile game is and if you’d buy the BACKBONE ONE.</p>

        <p>After your father’s passing, you inherit the apartment he left behind.</p><p>Then one day, a mysterious man appears with a warning for you—the new landlord:</p><p>“There are Yokai living among the residents in your apartment building.”</p><p>From that moment on, your journey to uncover the cleverly disguised Yokai begins.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p>A social deduction adventure where monsters wear human faces.</p><p>This is a social deduction adventure game where you, as the landlord, must uncover Yokai who are blending in among your apartment’s tenants by gathering clues and presenting evidence.</p><p>The game is a single narrative divided into multiple chapters.

                <p>Late last month, Santa Ragione, the developer behind the indie horror game Horses, revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> while the game was still in development. The game had been set to release on Epic Games Store this week, but now Epic has banned Horses as well.</p><p>Santa Ragione shared <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy statement on its site</a>, as well as reproduced messages from Epic that broke the news about the cancellation a day before launch. The dispatch from Epic cites violations of its inappropriate content policy and hateful or abusive content policies. Epic also stated that Horses got an Adults Only rating, and those games are excluded from the store.</p><p>In response, Santa Ragione mentioned that Epic approved the game for release just over three weeks ago, and that the actual rating for the game was M for Mature under the ESRB and PEGI 18 in international territories. The studio went on to explain again that Horses is not a sexually charged adult game.</p><p>"We immediately appealed their decision through all suggested channels, stating clearly that the game does NOT contain explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," reads the statement from Santa Ragione. "All nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation. There is never any visible sexual act involving genitalia and all animations are stylized and unrealistic. Additionally, in the three hours of gameplay contained in the game, there are only four brief and censored sexual sequences, with two of them happening mainly off camera. And finally, we explained that the content presented does not in any way promote abuse (including animal abuse). The game is a strong critique of violence and abuse in general."</p><p>Although Santa Ragione was given an opportunity to appeal, the judgment was quickly upheld and now the game is banned from the two biggest PC storefronts... and possibly a third as well. Horses had been set to be released on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store</a>, but the listing now redirects away from the game's page and it doesn't appear to be listed on that site any longer. GameSpot has reached out to Humble for comment.</p><p>Santa Ragione previously disclosed that it invested $100,000 in the development of Horses, and that it may close as a result of being locked out of Steam. Getting banned from Epic may have made the studio's situation even more difficult. Regardless, Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>. And while it's not an adults-only game, some aspects of it are very disturbing. The horses at the center of the game aren't really horses at all. They're people who have been forced to wear horse masks and live like a horse.</p>

            <p>Fresh footage of Resident Evil Requiem was shown on Japanese television, and it's very reminiscent of classic series gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage was part of a special programme, and has been shared on social media by series insider Dusk Golem.</p>
<p>It's only thirty seconds long, but it shows protagonist Grace Ashcroft exploring a creepy mansion in third-person, shooting at zombies before being grabbed and nibbled on.</p>

<p>It's not much to go on, admittedly, and that description alone probably sounds incredibly trite. But it does suggest a return to the sort of gameplay and setting that made Resident Evil such a popular series, which will be music to the ears of longtime fans.</p>
<p>Specifically, it looks very reminiscent of Resident Evil 1 - although that's likely not the iconic Spencer Mansion we'll be exploring.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>Dusk Golem clarified the footage will be from a censored Japanese version, which typically censors headshots and dismemberment, for example.</p>
<p>The mainline series has strayed from its roots somewhat from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> onwards, experimenting with new settings, new perspectives, and new protagonists. Resident Evil Requiem, meanwhile, seems to be attempting to appease a wide spectrum of fans: there's a new protagonist, but linked to the older games; it allows players to shift between first and third-person perspectives; and it returns to Racoon City at last. </p>
<p>Now we know there's a new mansion to explore, to boot.</p>
<p>Further, producer Masato Kumazawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who">confirmed characters from previous games in the series will return</a>, though told fans not to "over-expect or hype it". Fans have long been speculating the return of series favourite Leon Kennedy, but we still don't know for sure if he'll appear.</p>
