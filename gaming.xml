		<p>Remedy Entertainment has shared a gameplay reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-resonant">Control Resonant</a>, their highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. The video runs for a few minutes, showcasing some of Dylan’s growing abilities, the game’s combat style and the twisted world you’ll be battling through.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Gameplay Reveal | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA71hdzim0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer picks up with Dylan on the trail of a Resonant, heading through an Inception-like folded rendition of Manhattan. He revcently acquired Shift as an ability, which allows him to defy the already broken gravity. His weapon is another transforming tool, but compared to the multi-tool gun of Control, this is all about melee. He also has more supernatural abilities for range, and the game looks to encourage you to switch between range and melee</p>
<p>The trailer builds up to snippets of a crazy battle against a giant laser-spewing whale or something, but that’s not the Resonant. No, that seems to be a kind of hammer-wielding ballet dancer?</p>
<p>Clearly there’s plenty more that Remedy don’t want to show just yet, but we’re excited for this one – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-control-resonant/">Control Resonant was right up there on our Most Wanted Games of 2026.</a></p>

<p>Control Resonant is expected to release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

		<p>The co-op Legends mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will launch on March 10th as a free update for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei Legends - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYyhow-EU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you need a refresher, Legends was first introduced in Ghost of Tsushima, and it added co-op missions where players took on fantastical enemies, participated in Raids, and played as new characters other than Jin Sakai. It is likely Ghost of Yotei will follow a similar format.</p>
<p><em>“Legends will launch with three mission types. In Survival, you can team up with up to three other players to take down waves of increasingly difficult enemies on one of four maps. You’ll fight to control territory on each map. While you control a location, you can activate a Blessing, offering you an advantage in battle. But if you lose control, you’ll unleash a Curse, putting your team at a disadvantage. Each map will have its own unique Curses and Blessings.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>In Story, you’ll team up with another player to tackle a series of 12 missions. After completing each set of three Story missions, you’ll unlock an Incursion, which is a large-scale four-player assault on a stronghold belonging to a member of the Yōtei Six. Each Incursion will culminate in a boss fight versus a giant, supernatural version of the Spider, the Oni, the Kitsune, or the Snake.</em></p>

<p><em>As for the other members of the Yōtei Six, in April we’ll release a Raid putting your team to the ultimate test, where you can expect to take on the Dragon and Lord Saito himself”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-unbreakable-x-men-join-the-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-roster-august-2026-release-date-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1434697</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Sony</strong> hosted its hour-long <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">February 2026 State of Play</a></strong> today, and while plenty of the announcements were surprises, some of them, like the new <strong>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</strong> reveal, we had a heads up on. After its Steam page was accidentally updated to include additional information, like how the game will feature <strong>20 characters at launch</strong>, it seemed like a safe bet that it would be featured during today's event.</p>



<p>Not only was it shown off, but we got another look at more gameplay with this trailer, specifically featuring the <strong>Unbreakable X-Men,</strong> with <strong>Storm, Magik, Wolverine,</strong> and <strong>Danger</strong> all joining the roster of playable fighters in Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. We also got the introduction of <strong>Episode Mode</strong>, a story-driven mode that combines Japanese manga and American-style comics to create a unique blend of storytelling.</p>



<p>And, perhaps most significantly for fighting game fans, we now have an <strong>August 6, 2026</strong>, PC and PS5 release date to look forward to.</p>



<p>It's the first team reveal for the game, and a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-arrives-on-ps5-pc-august-6/">PlayStation Blog post</a> that went live alongside the trailer digs a bit into the game's narrative, with Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger being the only X-Men capable of continuing the fight as a new threat looms over Earth, after a recent battle left the rest of the squad with limited strength. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - Unbreakable X-Men Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4C_0Yf43fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Viewed with suspicion and persecuted as “others,” mutants face hostility from humanity. Despite this, the reborn X-Men press on, driven by inner conflict as they strive to protect even the humans who persecute them from the looming threat.</em> <em>What decisions the team will make, and how their story will conclude, is something we hope you look forward to discovering</em>," writes producer <strong>Takeshi Yamanaka</strong>.</p>



<p>Regarding the Episode Mode, we won't be getting traditional cutscenes in different animation styles. Instead, the game's narrative will be shown "<em>as motion comics, centred around manga illustrated by celebrated artists</em>."</p>



<p>Interestingly, while we got to see a lot of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls here, what we didn't get any hint of is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/"><strong>FlexStrike</strong> fight stick</a> <strong>PlayStation</strong> has previously showcased alongside Marvel Tokon. It was theorized that the fight stick will arrive alongside Marvel Tokon, and its absence from today's showcase may be an indication that it won't make the August launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have more information on both the FlexStrike and the rest of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' full roster soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Housemarque Shows Off More Saros Gameplay at the State of Play Ahead of April 2026 Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/housemarque-shows-off-more-saros-gameplay-at-the-state-of-play-ahead-of-april-2026-launch/</link>
            <guid>1434694</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong>Saros</strong> getting an <strong>April 30, 2026, </strong>release date confirmation during <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">The Game Awards 2025</a>,</strong> it seemed like a lock to be included during today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, and it was. <strong>Housemarque</strong> did not disappoint, making a major show of more gameplay from Saros as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>Today's trailer dug deeper into the game's systems and focused more on what Housemarque means by its "<em>come back stronger</em>" mantra for Saros' gameplay style. We got a look at how you'll upgrade your armor via the Armor Matrix with resources you gather on your runs, and how you'll choose your upgrades to suit your playstyle. </p>



<p>We also got a look at the fast travel system, which lets you travel to any biome you've already unlocked. You can try and complete everything in one go, but thankfully, you're no longer forced to, as you can head directly to the biome you left off at. Of course, <strong>Returnal</strong> players will remember that you didn't have to play through the entirety of a biome once you have defeated the boss, but this is now a more direct solution, so you can pick up where you left off.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We also got a look at how the Eclipse corrupts weapons and artifacts in the game, and how, on top of the onslaught of enemies you'll face, you'll have to push through the effects of the Eclipse to survive. It even changes certain biome properties, like making marsh water in one of the biomes come alive and burn you when it's active. Hostiles will also fire projectiles that have been corrupted by the Eclipse at you when it's active, doing even more damage than they would without it.</p>



<p>Housemarque promised to have more coming between now and launch, so if you don't feel like you've had <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/">your fill of Saros showcases</a>, stay tuned.</p>

            <p>
You knew it was coming, I knew it was coming, and now one Mr. Hideo Kojima himself (disclaimer: technically it was Sony during tonight's State of Play, though I'm sure he's Fweeted about it on Fwitter) has confirmed that yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is making its way to PC. It's also doing so pretty soon, and with a small suite of additional features not present in its original PS5 release.
</p>
<p>
For starters, that release date: it's March 19th! That's a little over a month away, and less than a year after it first launched, so, not a horrendously long wait all things considered. Those features unique to PC are pretty much exactly what you'd expect with things like ultrawide monitor support, in both 21:9 UltraWidescreen, and 32:9 Super UltraWidescreen, and 4K resolution.

<p>
There's also the option for uncapped framerates, obviously depending on your PC specs, or upscaling and frame generation if that's more your speed. And if you've got a DualSense controller, there's full support for that too, or you can use your mouse and keyboard if you're that committed to that kind of life. Over on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/">PlayStation Blog</a> it was also confirmed that some new modes will be coming "that will offer players new challenges and rewards." Your guess is as good as mine as to what those could be, but they'll be coming at launch in any case, with details coming next month.
</p><p>
If you've not already played this one on PS5 yet, it honestly is just more of the same of the first game, but this time in Australia, with a few bells, whistles, gadgets, and gizmos thrown on top. I'm not one to heap praise upon Kojima needlessly, guy's got a cushy enough life, but from what I've played of it, just walking around beautiful, endless deserts, mountainscapes, and all sorts does have a certain something to it. Though, there is a touch too much shooting compared to the first game for my liking.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you can already wishlist Death Stranding 2: On the Beach on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3280350/DEATH_STRANDING_2_ON_THE_BEACH/">Steam</a> ahead of its release next month.

              <p>A new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em> showed off the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">grim trauma lurking beneath the surface of the extraction shooter’s colorful Tau Ceti IV planetary environments</a>, but it teased more than just sci-fi horror worldbuilding. Bungie also revealed the dates for the game’s pre-launch beta, giving players one last chance to go hands-on before deciding whether to fork over $40 for Sony’s latest live-service multiplayer game.</p> <p><em>Marathon</em>‘s pre-launch “server slam” goes live on February 26 and will run through March 2, just a few days before the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975">full release date on March 5</a>. Players will be able to dive into the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC with the limited demo coinciding with the upcoming Steam Next Fest. While you don’t need to pre-order the game to get in, you’ll need a PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscription to access the server slam on consoles.</p>

  <p>The open beta will feature a “limited selection of maps, Runner shells, and contracts” for players to test out, with more maps, factions, contracts, gear, and other content coming at launch and during Season 1. While progress won’t carry over to the full game, players can earn tiered gear packages that will then come in handy when they get started in the loot extraction shooter once it’s out.</p> <p>PS Plus subscribers will also get the chance to unlock a handful of exclusive rewards to show they participated in the server slam: special emblems and banners linked to other PlayStation franchises. Those include weapon charms from <em>Helldivers 2</em>,<em> Death Stranding 2</em>, and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. Xbox and PC players will be able to earn them too at some point, though it’s not clear how yet. <em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-director-budget-development-2000661252">went through a rough patch last year</a> but recent leaks of a playtest in China suggested things have improved quite a bit since the original alpha test.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-physical-edition-price/</link>
            <guid>1434679</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War Sons of Sparta is one of 2026’s biggest and best shocks without question. A new GOW game is a shock, but if you want to know how much it is first, or if it’s on disc, this guide has all the answers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026 Sony</a> State of Play had no right to drop bombshell after bombshell. If you thought the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Remake Trilogy</a> is coming was big, a shadow-dropped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Sons of Sparta</a> was a Cronos-sized surprise</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-on-disc-physical-edition-explained">Can You Buy God of War Sons of Sparta On Disc? Physical Edition, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Like a fever dream. Credit to Santa Monica Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is currently a digital-only game, meaning you can buy it from the PlayStation Store on PS5 and nowhere else.</strong></p>



<p>This is likely a case of shocking everyone with an impromptu shadow drop first, accumulating millions in sales and copies sold, then giving the game a second lease of life later down the line with a physical copy.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-stars-again-during-february-2026-sony-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saros Stars Again During February 2026 Sony State of Play</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It’s hard to shadow drop a game on disc, making digital the only logical and viable solution. You can buy either God of War Sons of Sparta Standard Edition or Digital Deluxe Edition to complement your virtual game collection.</p>



<p>The latter comes with several benefits, including in-game items, a digital artbook, soundtrack, and PlayStation Avatar: A fine gift from the Gods of Olympus.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">How Much is God of War Sons of Sparta?</h2>



<p><strong>God of War Sons of Sparta is $29.99 through the US PlayStation Store or £24.99 in the UK.</strong></p>



<p>For a brand-new God of War game with premium polish, this is a pretty decent price tag. Attaching the God of War brand to anything in 2026 could warrant a hefty price tag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/santa-monica-studio/" id="87635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Monica</a> and Sony have been quite generous here.</p>

</ul>



<p>Furthermore, if you want to stump up a bit more Gold, the Digital Deluxe Edition is $39.99 USD or £32.99.</p>

All he has on him besides his clothes are an IV bag and a medical wristband with his name on it. He heads to the town with no leads but the voices from the CRTV he picked up along the way. Venturing deeper and driven to understand his connection to the place and its inhabitants, Simon begins to discover fragments of a past rising to the surface. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Experienced entirely in first person, Simon must explore, evade, and survive using a limited set of weapons and tools, including the CRTV, a pocket television used to tune into unstable signals. Evasion is tense; combat is frenetic, while narrative driven puzzles reveal a truth that refuses to stay submerged. </p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer and today’s <em>Silent Hill</em> Transmission below.

            <p>Santa Monica Studio has revealed a new game in the God of War series, and it is a 2D side-scroller.</p>
<p>It is known as God of War: Sons of Sparta, and will tell a canon story all about Kratos in his youth. To be more specific, it is set during Kratos' "brutal training at the Spartan Agoge alongside his brother Deimos". The two brothers will have to "overcome threats that will put all their training to the test while confronting the true meaning of duty and honour".</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta has been developed by Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. And, it is out on PS5… now! You can check out its trailer below.</p>

<p>As well as this new game, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade. This particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series’ roots that got us to where we are today," reads a post on the PlayStation blog.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we’re very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, you can enjoy this introduction from Kratos voice actor TC Carson.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With less than a month to go before release, Bungie has announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> open preview weekend – a “server slam” – will take place the weekend before the full launch on 5th March. From 26th February to 2nd March, all platforms will be able to jump in and get an introduction to the game’s take on the extraction shooter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Gameplay Trailer | Marathon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXhQbF7TlbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This will be just an introduction to Marathon’s content, with additional maps, factions, contracts and more coming in the full game and then through Season 1. However, it will serve the main purposes for the game, being a bit of a demo for players, and a test for the game’s servers.</p>
<p>The Server Slam will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infil into two zones:
<ul>
<li>Perimeter</li>
<li>Dire Marsh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take on the opening contracts for five of Marathon’s factions</li>
<li>Try out all six Runner Shells, plus Rook in scavenger mode</li>
<li>Solo queue, proximity chat, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>Season 1 will then bring:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two more zones
<ul>
<li>Outpost</li>
<li>Cryo Archive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full contract and progression trees unlocked for all six factions</li>
<li>Ranked mode</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, rewards can be earned during the test that will roll through to your profile at release. There will be a special emblem and banner to show you were first, and you’ll be able to earn a launch bundle with weapons, body implants, and more.</p>
<p>Oh, and PS Plus players will be able to claim a trio of weapon charms for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> – Onryō Weapon Charm</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> – Battle Guitar Weapon Charm</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> – For Freedom Weapon Charm</li>
</ul>
<p>So, are you going to give it a go later this month?</p>

		<p>Sony have announced something new for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war/">God of War</a> but sadly it’s not a brand new game in the main series. God of War Trilogy Remake is in “very early” development and will be, as the name suggests, a remake of the first three games set in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, is returning, but no further information was released. I wonder if they will keep the rather saucy minigames?</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Trilogy Remake - Announcement Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_tq12WisX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In God of War (2005), Kratos serves Ares, the God of War, after pledging himself in desperation during battle. Manipulated by Ares into slaughtering his own wife and daughter, he eventualy ends up killin Ares and taking the title for himself.</p>
<p>The second game has Kratos stripped of all his powers by Zeus, killed, and banished to the underworld. He eventually teams up with the Titans, rewinds time and attacks Mount Olympus. Clearly not learning his lesson from the first time, Zeus then kills him again in the third game. Very careless, Kratos!</p>

<p>Also announced is a brand new game in the franchise, but it’s not what you might expect. God of War Sons of Sparta is a side-scrolling combat game that tells the story of a young Kratos, before he became the God of War. The game is out right now on PlayStation 5!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/yeah-its-a-aaa-john-wick-game-saber-interactive-reveals-john-wick-coming-to-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1434631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Out of all the announcements included in today's <strong>February 2026 State of Play</strong>, the one that will potentially be the most remembered is <strong>Saber Interactive's</strong> reveal of a AAA <strong>John Wick</strong> game, featuring <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong> in the titular role, and the confirmation that the game is being made in collaboration with <strong>Chad Stahelski</strong>, director of the recent films and one of the key visonaries behind their success (who is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/">directing a Ghost of Tsushima film</a>).</p>



<p>You might recall that last month, almost right at the beginning of the year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/triple-a-john-wick-and-saw-games-teased-by-lionsgate/"><strong>Lionsgate </strong>teased</a> that it was working on a major John Wick game. This came years after the company confirmed that it had been fielding pitches for a game, but that was back in 2022. There was never any sign, until Lionsgate's tease, that a pitch had actually landed.</p>



<p>But Saber Interactive's clearly did, and it looks like Lionsgate has made the right choice, while Saber has also made the right decision to collaborate closely with the creators behind the films. It looks exactly like what you'd expect from a John Wick game, and hopefully there's plenty more that we've just not seen yet.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We are working closely with Chad Stahelski (John Wick director and franchise visionary), Keanu Reeves, and Lionsgate to produce a highly anticipated, adrenaline-fueled experience that fits into the world of John Wick</em>," writes game director <strong>Jesus Iglesias</strong> in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/john-wick-game-announced-for-ps5/">PlayStation Blog post</a>. "<em>This game takes place during a specific period within the John Wick timeline and contributes to the expansive and rich lore of the franchise.</em>"<em> </em></p>



<p>"<em>Like many of you, we are huge John Wick fans, and having the opportunity to bring one of the most captivating and successful action franchises to life on PlayStation is a rewarding experience for us.</em> <em>The story is being created in collaboration with our writers, Chad Stahelski, and Lionsgate. It is an original gameplay narrative that addresses a significant time in John Wick’s life, featuring well-known and iconic characters, as well as compelling new characters specifically created for this production</em>."</p>



<p>Iglesias goes on to say that the studio is working to incorporate signature aspects of the character that fans will expect to see, while also showcasing unique camerawork, "<em>bold and cinematic environments, and of course, the extremely distinctive gun-fu action and intense driving experiences</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I feel like these digital showcases keep getting longer, and Sony’s latest State of Play was a beefy. hour-long show of new games coming to the PS5. If you weren’t able to catch the stream live, you can watch it below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p>  <h2><em>Kena: Scars of Kosmora</em></h2>  <p>Kicking off the show is&nbsp;<em>Kena: Scars of Kosmora</em>, a sequel to <em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>. We see a bit of its fantasy action and its open world, all with a slightly older Kena leading the way. Gosh, it sure is pretty. Was the first one this <em>Horizon</em>-esque? It’s coming to PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei Legends</em></h2>  <p>Sucker Punch is up next with <em>Legends</em>, the co-op multiplayer side of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. We saw four playable classes working together in what looks like raids against demon armies. It launches on March 10.</p> <h2><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></h2>  <p>Kojima’s latest is making the leap from PS5 to PC on March 19.</p> <h2><em>4: LOOP</em></h2>  <p>Bad Robot Studios is up next with <em>4: LOOP</em>, a cooperative sci-fi shooter with gross monsters, roguelike-esque routes, and endlessly replayable missions. The game will get a beta test later this year.</p>

 <h2><em>Pragmata</em></h2>  <p>Next up we get a look at Capcom’s upcoming puzzle shooter&nbsp;<em>Pragmata</em>. This trailer had a bit of a character-driven focus, with its two leads talking about their pasts before getting chased by some gross-ass monsters. The game launches on April 24, and a demo is available now.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2>  <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>is just about two weeks away, so I guess Capcom wanted one more chance to put it in front of people. The game stars Grace and Leon in a dueling story of methodical horror and high-octane action. We also see Leon returning to his old Raccoon City police department.</p> <h2><em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance Remastered</em></h2>  <p>A remaster of <em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS4 and PS5, bringing a new coat of paint, photo mode, third-person camera, and some behind-the-scenes special features. It launches on March 3.</p>

 <h2><em>Brigadine Abyss</em></h2>  <p>The latest entry in the fantasy strategy RPG series is coming to PS5 later this year.</p> <h2><em>Dead or Alive 6 Last Round</em></h2>  <p><i>Dead or Alive 6&nbsp;</i>is getting an update with&nbsp;<em>Last Round</em>, which adds new characters, costumes, and a photo mode, and it’ll get further updates in the following months. It launches on June 25 with both a paid premium version and a free-to-play edition.</p>  <p>Also, a new&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive. </em>game is officially in development.</p> <h2><em>Control Resonant</em></h2> <p>Next we got a lengthy gameplay showcase for&nbsp;<em>Control Resonant</em>, the upcoming action sequel to&nbsp;<em>Control</em>. It looks like it will scratch a&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>itch you might be feeling…ya know, if we get to the end of this presentation and we’re still lacking on that front.</p>

 <h2><em>Crimson Moon</em></h2>  <p>I thought they were about to announce a new <em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>right after I said, what with the metal music and all the talk in this trailer of being a demon half-breed. But no, it’s <em>Crimson Moon</em> and the dark fantasy action game is coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Beast of Reincarnation</em></h2>  <p>Oh look, Game Freak is showing up on another non-Nintendo showcase with <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, a fantasy action RPG from the team behind <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s launching on August 4.</p>

 <h2><em>Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</em></h2> <p>If you want to play multiple versions of the original&nbsp;<em>Rayman</em>, the sidescroller is being packaged with a bunch of behind-the-scenes special features. It’s coming out tomorrow digitally, with physical copies coming to stores on June 26.</p> <h2><em>Mina the Hollower</em></h2> <p>After several delays,&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>is coming out later this year. You can play Yacht Club Games’ next project tomorrow with a PlayStation-exclusive demo.</p> <h2><em>Neva: Prologue</em></h2>  <p>A prequel to the 2024 puzzle platformer&nbsp;<em>Neva&nbsp;</em>is coming out on February 19.</p> <h2><em>Yakoh Shinobi Ops</em></h2>  <p><em>Yakoh Shionobi Ops&nbsp;</em>is a pretty violent stealth action co-op game coming to PS5 in 2027.</p>

 <h2><em>Project Windless</em></h2>  <p><em>Project</em> <em>Windless</em>, based on the Korean fantasy series <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em><em>, </em>basically looks like a musou game starring a sword-swinging bird man as he fights entire armies on his own.</p> <h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em></h2>  <p>We got a look at the gameplay in upcoming <em>Star Wars </em>game&nbsp;<em>Galactic Racer</em>, and it looks like a pretty action-heavy arcade racer with a story set in a galaxy far, far away. It will launch later this year.</p> <h2><em>007: First Light</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new look at <em>007: First Light</em> from&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>developer IOI Interactive. The trailer focuses on how green and reckless the secret agent is in this origin story. The game launches on May 27.</p> <h2><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection 2</em></h2>  <p>Konami got its own dedicated segment, which included a look at&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s second&nbsp;<em>Master Collection</em>. This will bring&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&nbsp;</em>to PS5, liberating it from the PS3 for the first time. The compilation will also include <em>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</em>. The collection launches on August 27. The first <em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>is also getting an update which bring a high-resolution option to the first and third <em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

 <h2><em>Darwin’s Paradox</em></h2> <p>Taking a hard left turn, we see&nbsp;<em>Darwin’s Paradox</em>, a puzzle platformer starring an octopus. A demo is available now, with the full game coming on April 2.</p> <h2><em>Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse</em></h2>  <p>Perhaps the most exciting thing Konami brought to the show, however, was&nbsp;<em>Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse</em>, the first new 2D&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>game since 2008’s <em>Order of Ecclesia</em>. Konami is making the game with the help of Evil Empire and Motion Twin as a celebration of the series’ 40th anniversary.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill: Townfall</em></h2>  <p>Okay, damn, I guess Konami’s just bringing out all its big guns.&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill: Townfall&nbsp;</em>is a collaboration between Konami and Annapurna, and it’s a first-person, methodical horror game. It’s coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Rev. Noir</em></h2>  <p>Alrighty, let’s get back into anime RPG mode with <em>Rev. Noir</em>. It’s a new JRPG that looks to draw heavily from games like <em>Tales&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, but we didn’t see much of it beyond a teaser that showed off its cast.</p>

 <h2><em>John Wick</em></h2>  <p><em>John Wick&nbsp;</em>is getting a new video game, and while we didn’t get to see much of the game itself in action, we did get to see Keanu wrecking dudes. It seems like Keanu Reeves is reprising the role for the game, too.</p> <h2><em>Marathon</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new trailer for Bungie’s upcoming shooter <em>Marathon</em>. It leans into a pretty compelling sci-fi psychological thriller vibe. A preview weekend will take place from February 26 to March 2, all leading up to launch on March 5.</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus</h2> <p>As previously reported,&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em> is coming to PlayStation Plus on February 17. <em>Tekken: Dark Resurrection</em> is also coming to the the classics catalog in March, with&nbsp;<em>Time Crisis</em> joining in May.</p> <h2><em>Big Walk</em></h2>  <p><em>Big Walk&nbsp;</em>will launch as a PlayStation Plus game when it comes to PS5 in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Saros</em></h2>  <p>Housemarque showed up to show off more of&nbsp;<em>Saros</em>, its upcoming roguelike shooter starring&nbsp;<em>Fall of the House of Usher </em>actor Rahul Kohli, and got real into the nitty-gritty of its systems. It seems like a pretty tough game, which is par for the course for the <em>Returnal&nbsp;</em>developer, though with persistent upgrades available here, it may also be considerably more approachable for those who bounced off that last one.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em></h2>  <p>Next we have new&nbsp;<em>X-Men</em>&nbsp;fighters joining the roster of Arc System Works’ <em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, including Storm, Magik, Wolverine, and Danger. The game is coming to PS5 and PC on August 6.</p> <h2><em>God of War</em></h2>  <p>The original <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>trilogy is getting a full remake for PS5, but that’s all we know. TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, showed up to&nbsp;tease the project, which is in the “early stages.”</p>  <p>Mega Cat Studios also showed off a sidescrolling&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game called&nbsp;<em>Sons of Sparta</em> set in Greece, which follows a much younger Kratos, and is out today.</p> <p>Damn. No&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, despite the rumors. Well, that went by quicker than I thought. And hey, I have one more&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game to play than I did an hour ago.</p>

              <p>We’re not getting a new 3D <em>God of War</em> just yet, but Sony did end today’s big PlayStation Showcase with a surprise shadowdrop for a 2D spin-off. <em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em> is a retro action platformer that takes Kratos’ story back to the beginning.</p> <p>“<em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em> is a 2D action platformer with a canon story set in Kratos’ youth during his brutal training at the Spartan Agoge alongside his brother Deimos,” reads the official description. “They must overcome threats that will put all their training to the test while confronting the true meaning of duty and honor.”</p>

 <p>Take a look:</p>  <p>Kratos will take on various beasts from Greek mythology with his sword and shield as he acquires Gifts of Olympus to unlock new abilities. It looks like how you remember beautiful pixel art action games from the Sega Genesis era looking, but way better. Hopefully it plays well too.</p> <p>It’s been developed by Mega Cat Studios, which shipped 2023’s <em>WrestleQuest</em> and recently brought back the <em>Backyard</em> sports games, in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It’s currently available to download on PlayStation 5 for $30.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During today’s PlayStation State of Play, the first of the year, Sony Santa Monica Studio announced it has started work on a remake of the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy.</p> <p>Here’s the trailer for this newly announced project.</p>  <p>There’s not much to see in this new trailer, which is really just a tiny teaser announcement for the project. By far the best part of the teaser is TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, showing up to be cool as heck and almost distracting me from the fact that this game is years away from release. Almost.</p> <p>“This project is still in the early stages,” teased Carson. “Next time we come back, we’re coming with something big.” The voice actor also confirmed he’ll be back as the voice of Kratos for this new project, and uh…that’s really it.</p>

 <p>While I’m excited for Carson’s return, I am definitely depressed to see another big video game franchise returning to the past with a remake instead of pushing forward with something new. It reminds me of <em>Halo’s</em> recently announced remake of the OG game, which is coming to PS5 and Xbox later this year. While I get that some fans are excited to replay these games and others are happy to have a new way to hop in, I’m just sitting here worrying that we have entered an era when even massively popular franchises are unable to take risks on new ideas and have to rely on what came before them to stick around.</p> <p>On the other hand, during this same teaser reveal for a <em>God of War</em> trilogy remake, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/god-of-war-greek-trilogy-remake-in-development-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-out-now/">PlayStation announced and released a new 2D <em>God of War</em> prequel</a> that looks fun and is the kind of thing I want to see more of from big companies. Let other studios play around with your franchises via smaller games with smaller budgets and less risk. That’s cool. <em>God of War: Sons of Sparta</em> is out today on PS5. The remake trilogy is years away, but in development.</p>

<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta is available starting today. This game is the long-awaited 2.5D Metroidvania-style game. It was the final game announced during the Sony State of Play, and the big announcement was that it’s available today.</p>



<p>The trailer for the shadow-dropped game came after an announcement that the original God of War Trilogy is being remade. That, however, is a long way away as the game is in the early stages of development. To make up for that, the long-rumored Metroidvania God of War is playable now.</p>



<p>Called “God of War: Sons of Sparta,” it tells Kratos’s origin story. Long before he was a God of War, he was a Spartan. There were brief action shots, clips of major enemy battles, and more. The legendary saga begins here.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-future-of-the-god-of-war-franchise">The Future of the God of War Franchise</h2>



<p>Not only is Kratos a video game legend, but his story is coming to television: Prime Video has ordered a series with Ryan Hurst, best known for his work in Sons of Anarchy, who will star as the Spartan. That series will also feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" id="172954">Mandy Patinkin and more.</a></p>



<p>The show will be largely based on the franchise’s newer games. Sons of Sparta is a brand new title, taking it all back to the beginning. It is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-PPSA28997_00-SONSOFSPARTAPS50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now for $29.99.</a></p>

The announcement was followed by TC Carson, the original voice actor for Kratos, who revealed that the Remake is in active development. However, it is still in its early stages, and it will be a long time before we receive another update on the title. But when they come, they have promised it’s going to be a big reveal. </p>
