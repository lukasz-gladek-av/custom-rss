		<p>Two Point Studios has announced that the next DLC for Two Point Museum will give players a new wildlife wing with Zooseum. Zooseum is less about putting animals on as exhibits but more on rescuing them, raising them, healing their issues, and working to rewild them. Much like what many modern zoos do. That also makes one wonder if this is a possible glimpse of a future Two Point Zoo game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum: Zooseum | Bite-Sized Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUeyNIuNmqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Aside from the short teaser trailer, there has been no further details about Two Point Museum’s Zooseum. Content and a release date will be announced later on, though a specific timeframe has not been given. Two Point Museum is launching on Nintendo Switch 2 tomorrow, and handily we have a review of it.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/27/two-point-museum-switch-2-review/">Two Point Museum Switch 2 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our review, Stefan said, <em>“Two Point Museum on Switch 2 is a fairly straightforward port to Nintendo’s latest console. The minor glitches and crashes should be ironed out quickly, but it’s clear that the game simulation does hit the limits of the Switch 2’s CPU and larger museums do drop the frame rate. Still, it remains a thoroughly enjoyable and endlessly quirky management sim that’s an easy recommendation for fans of the genre and this series in particular. If you can’t accept a few compromises, the other platforms are ready and waiting.”</em></p>

In fact, it has put up the US' biggest physical game launch in over two years.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.circana.com/gb">Circana</a>'s Mat Piscatella on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">Bluesky</a>, who noted that the US hasn't seen a launch like Z-A's since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> arrived back on the scene in May 2023.</p>
<p>We should note that the data only accounts for "physical unit and dollar sales" and <em>not</em> digital or bundle purchases, but nonetheless, standing up there with TOTK — one of the most-anticipated games in recent memory — isn't bad going.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59yotvwh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there might be a bit of you thinking "well, duh, it's Pokémon, <em>obviously</em> it sold well," and you'd be right... for the most part. As we alluded to earlier, Z-A's release numbers are far from what the series has mustered in the past. In Europe, the game's racked up the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/uk-charts-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-smallest-retail-launch-since-lets-go-in-europe">smallest retail launch for a mainline game</a> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_lets_go_pikachu_and_lets_go_eevee">Let's Go! Pikachu and Let's Go! Eevee</a>, and while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/japanese-charts-surprise-surprise-pokemon-legends-z-a-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust">Japanese numbers</a> are impressive, it's <em>far</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>'s debut.</p>
<p>All this is to say, even a quieter Pokémon launch is still a rather big deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-massive-retail-launch-in-the-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-had-%E2%80%98massive%E2%80%99-retail-launch-in-the-us-biggest-since-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom.1335964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last Friday, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the latest entry in the ever-popular monster catching franchise, had sold 5.8 million copies in its debut week.</p>



<p>Now, Circana's Senior Director &amp; Video Game Industry Thought Leader, Mat Piscatella, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the game's retail launch was particularly big in the United States, where it registered the best performance of the last two and a half years.</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A had a massive US launch at retail. Launch week physical unit and dollar sales of Pokémon Legends: Z-A were the biggest for a new physical video game launch since The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in May of 2023.</em></p>



<p>It's not at all surprising that Nintendo games excel at retail sales performance. PlayStation and Xbox users have long since switched to digital games, but the Nintendo audience is different and still quite linked to physical units.</p>



<p>In Europe, though, the retail launch was a bit smaller. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/pokemon-legends-z-a-captures-no1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to The Game Business</a>, which had access to GSD data, Pokémon Legends: Z-A managed to knock EA's Battlefield 6 from the top position but also registered a 28% sales drop compared to the debut week of Pokémon Legends: Arceus in 2022. Indeed, as noted back when the official sales announcement was shared last week, Arceus had sold 6.5 million units in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>Still, the game appears to have received the acclaim of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, Nathan Birch wrote:</p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>’s battle royale mode has a name, and it isn’t quite as awful as I was expecting, falling well short of the exhilarating cringe of "Battlefortnite". Battlefield REDSEC, they’re calling it. Such a Tom Clancelled, Limp Bizkit-ass moniker. What does REDSEC stand for, EA? Rampant Ennui Detected, Send Emergency Cookies? Or is it a game about hunting down commie office assistants? See, this is why they pay me the big bananas here at Rock Paper Shitpun Dot Com.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The more momentous news here is that REDSEC will be free-to-play. This implies that it will exist as a standalone experience, like Call Of Duty: Warzone – an endlessly contracting and expanding skirmish that floats alongside the numbered sequels. It won’t just be an update for Battlefield 6 itself, which explains why it’s absent from the latter’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">Season 1 DLC plans</a>. Still, I’m getting ahead of myself.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing else to share right now, beyond pointing you toward EA’s placeholder for the full gameplay trailer tomorrow. It seems likely the publishers’ hands have been forced by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-official-name-and-release-date-reportedly-leak-online">rumours this weekend</a> - the people who outed it as REDSEC also claim that it'll launch on 28th October.</p>

<p>Last week, dataminers also discovered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/either-battlefield-6s-battle-royale-mode-will-release-next-week-or-theyre-adding-granite-or-something-called-granite">a mysterious piece of forthcoming content called “Granite”</a> on the EA app, rumoured to be the new Battlefield's battle royale functionality. I am defiantly clinging to the hope that this is a literal addition to the game's building materials that will absolutely ruin the lives of tank drivers.
</p><p>
All this comes as EA make tweaks to Battlefield 6’s progression system, handling and arsenal – recent measures include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-drops-bots-from-verified-mode-playlist-as-ea-continues-fight-against-those-dastardly-xp-farmers">cracking down on attempts</a> to farm the bots in custom modes for easy XP. In hindsight, I wonder how much of that tweaking was carried out with a view to preparing the ground for REDSEC – even if the latter can be played separately, there will surely be a lot of crossover with Battlefield 6’s multiplayer component. I also wouldn’t be surprised if the game takes heavy inspiration from Respawn’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, EA’s flagship battle royale – the current head of Battlefield Studios is Vince Zampella, Respawn co-founder.
</p>
<p>
Again, I’m speculating. And why should I speculate, when some of you lurking bastards have been playing REDSEC in playtests? I know because you keep popping up in the comments on Battlefield 6 articles to waggle your eyebrows and hum innocently. Come on, break your NDA. I won't tell anyone. Nobody from EA reads this site anyway. There's a nice banana in it for you if you spill the beans.

<p>For years, the Halo Insider Program has enabled loyal fans to hear about the latest Halo playtests. It’s been discovered that PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5 will be able to take part in future test sessions.</p>



<p>The Halo news keeps coming thick and fast—especially if you’re on PlayStation! First, the bombshell announcement that we knew was coming—but still hit hard all the same—was that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Remake is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. It’s the latest ground to be broken between Xbox and PlayStation. We’ve now seen for ourselves that PS4 and PS5 gamers can even test Halo before new games launch.</p>

<p>It’s likely many of you have been part of the Halo Insider Program for a while. One of the biggest perks is the ability to “Participate in public ‘flights’ (hands-on playtests) of in-progress Halo game releases and provide feedback to our development teams.”</p>



<p>Ordinarily, this benefit has been reserved for Xbox and PC owners. This is no longer the case as the Halo Insider Console Flighting settings on your personal account now have new options.</p>



<p>We’ve tested this out ourselves, logged in, and can confirm you’ll now see some new PlayStation options for Halo Insider:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PlayStation 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 4 Pro</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Alongside <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, rumors are swirling that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-live-service-rumor-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a live-service Halo game is possibly in the works</a>. There could be even more stuff happening behind the scenes that we’re not aware of yet. All this means is there’s a good chance new Halo content is on the way that needs testing, and PlayStation gamers will get to help.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sharkmob has announced the imminent end of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt, a free battle royale title with a vampiric twist. The game launched in 2021 but was sunsetted in a way in 2023 when the team announced it would no longer be providing updates to the game.</p>



<p>Now, the squad at Sharkmob is preparing for a complete shutdown, taking the servers offline and jamming a stake into the heart of Bloodhunt for good on April 28, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodhunt-laid-to-rest">Bloodhunt, Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent release</a>, the team at Sharkmob revealed the incoming shutdown of Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During these past four years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>



<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;offline.</p>



<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the&nbsp;<em>Bloodhunt</em>&nbsp;servers on April 28, 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The release mentioned that the game will remain <strong>fully playable </strong>until that date, but when it comes around, the game will no longer be available to download or play. To prepare for the shutdown, Sharkmob has delisted tokens, but the in-game store will remain open if you want to spend any residual credits you might have.</p>



<p>In the closing words of the release, Sharkmob wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for being with us on this journey. We hope your memories from the rooftops and back alleys of Prague will stay with you as they have with us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2022, Bloodhunt launched on Steam, moving out of early access and pulling in quite a few players for a niche, indie battle royale game. It peaked at 29,475 players on Valve’s flagship platform, but checking the numbers now, just 603 concurrent users were logged on in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Bloodhunt hasn’t broken 1,000 concurrent players on Steam since October 2024.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt taken offline? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Inspired by Wizardry, Ultima, and Shin Megami Tensei.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Unison Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/unison-games">Unison Games</a> has announced <em><a title="Games > Descent of Lunaris" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/descent-of-lunaris">Descent of Lunaris</a></em>, “a love letter to classic dungeon crawlers” inspired by games like <em>Wizardry</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, and <em><a title="Series > Shin Megami Tensei [96 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>. It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [24,646 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3824720/Descent_Of_Lunaris/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A release date was not announced. <span id="more-1002726"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Unison Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Set in the year 2070, a lunar mining operation uncovers an impossible signal emanating from deep within the <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a>. The moment it is unearthed, the base’s machines turn violent, slaughtering most of the inhabitants. A team of operatives from across the globe is dispatched to descend into the newly uncovered world, uncover the cause, and confront truths that will change human history forever.</p><p><strong>Explore, Survive, Descend, Repeat</strong></p><p>Players aren’t simply fighting to survive another descent, they’re unraveling a mystery that asks difficult questions about the nature of humanity itself. Every floor deepens the uncertainty: are you discovering the truth, or being led somewhere you were always meant to go? Are you investigating, or are you the one on trial? This is a dungeon crawler for a new generation: one that remembers the past, embraces the present, and peers unflinchingly into a future that may be darker than we expect.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Modernized dungeon crawling</p><p>In <em>Descent of Lunaris</em>, players will navigate a sprawling network of grid-based levels hidden beneath the lunar surface, each one designed with branching paths, environmental storytelling, and dark secrets. As they descend deeper, dungeons evolve beyond industrial corridors and lunar rock into surreal landscapes shaped by an unknown source. Familiar structures and mythologies appear twisted and distorted, constantly shifting the tone of exploration from eerie discovery to psychedelic nightmare.</p><p>Exploration isn’t just about <a title="Genres > Survival [477 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>, as every area is filled with strange characters who could be allies, enemies, or something in between depending on player choices. Unlocking hidden passages, uncovering optional bosses, and piecing together fragments of story, turns the descent itself into a narrative arc: each area not only tests your party’s endurance and combat ability, but also reveals unsettling glimpses of humanity’s reflection in the eyes of something that should not exist.</p><p><strong>Hybrid Combat System</strong></p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em> pushes dungeon-crawling combat beyond a single style by fusing two classic RPG approaches into one seamless experience. At its core, the game features traditional JRPG turn-based battles, where party formation, skill usage, and resource management are key to surviving attrition across long dungeon runs. Every choice matters: when to heal, when to unleash powerful abilities, and when to conserve resources for what’s still ahead.</p><p>But the deeper players go, the rules change. Encounters shift into tactical grid-based battles, expanding the battlefield and forcing players to think in terms of positioning, movement, and area control. These encounters allow for larger groups of enemies, multi-phase boss fights, and environmental hazards that transform combat into a puzzle of survival. Players must constantly adapt by reshaping party formations, experimenting with subclasses, and tailoring strategies to the unique demands of each fight. The system rewards foresight, creativity, and bold risk-taking, creating a rhythm where every new area feels distinct and unpredictable.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1002727"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Team Customization</strong></p><p>Every operative in <em>Descent of Lunaris</em> can be shaped and refined to match their preferred approach to exploration and combat. Abilities can be tailored and upgraded, allowing players to reinforce core strengths or experiment with hybrid builds. Unlocking subclasses transforms an operative into something entirely new: a frontline fighter who develops healing skills, or a support specialist who learns to manipulate battlefield control. A deep and complex affinity system and individual stat point customization creates a nearly infinite number of potential party builds to deal with any situation. Unique gear modifiers, leadership abilities based on what character is commanding your team, and unlockable passive traits layer together to create a vast well of replayability.</p><p>Distorted environments and surreal enemy encounters will demand team flexibility. A squad built for brute force might struggle against psychological or environmental hazards, while a carefully balanced team can adapt and endure. No two parties will be alike. <em>Descent of Lunaris</em> rewards players who experiment, iterate, and discover their own path through the nightmare beneath the lunar surface.</p><p><strong>Atmospheric Visuals and Sound</strong></p><p>From the first step onto the lunar base, players are immersed in a stark industrial science-fiction aesthetic: cold metal corridors, dim control rooms, and the humming of heavy machinery. This grounded foundation sets the stage for the descent into the unknown. As they explore deeper, the visuals evolve into something stranger. Sharp, evocative, and often unsettling 2D character and creature art enmesh with (and somehow still stand apart from) the modern 3D dungeon environments, creating a visual tension between the familiar and the alien. Surfaces glitch, perspectives warp, and familiar structures become distorted echoes of human civilization. The player isn’t just moving deeper into the moon, but into something very old and likely hostile.</p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em>‘ soundscape reinforces this growing instability with a creeping sense of unease. The soundtrack, curated from underground musicians and experimental producers, guides the player through tonal shifts: industrial rhythms in the early levels, sparse ambient textures filled with dread, and distorted psychedelic beats as reality begins to fracture. Each floor of the dungeon is an escalation. More surreal, more distorted, and more unnerving, pulling the player further from the safety of reality and deeper into the nightmare beneath.</p><p><strong>What Have We Done?</strong></p><p><em>Descent of Lunaris</em> is Unison Games’ love letter to the <a title="Genres > Dungeon RPG [81 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/dungeon-rpg">dungeon RPGs</a> that first defined the genre. It carries forward that classic grid-based exploration to merge with <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,827 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> turn-based combat and party-building strategies that recalls experiences from titles like <em>Wizardry</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, and <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>. With a haunting narrative and a mission that challenges not just survival but the very nature of humanity, this is a dungeon crawler for a new generation.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> currently has less wishlists on Steam than the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> dating sim. It's ranked 173rd as of writing, behind the Killer Bean game at 73rd, and the Gothic remake in 17th place. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> seems to be hogging the spotlight right now, and with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 set to come out in roughly two weeks, should Treyarch and Activision Blizzard be worried?</p>
<p>Well, one thing is for certain, Call of Duty hasn't had this much competition in a while. The obvious challenger is Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">which not only is easily outperforming any other entry in the series in over a decade</a>, but has outright fired shots at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">Call of Duty's recent tendency to focus on celebrity over realistic modern military aesthetics</a>.</p>
<p>We've already seen some drastic shifts from the standard Call of Duty strategy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-u-turn-on-absurd-cosmetics-is-proof-that-battlefield-6-competition-is-a-really-good-thing">The game is cutting off some of the gaudier cosmetics available in previous games</a>, resigning them only to Warzone while keeping the newest iteration of multiplayer rooted in the expected setting. Would this have happened if Battlefield wasn't speaking directly to the FPS crowd? Maybe, maybe not - but it seems the competition to the FPS throne has caused the needle move for the CoD franchise to some degree. Is that why we’re seeing the CoD franchise so far down the wishlists on Steam?</p>

</figure>
<p>Battlefield 6’s success is one factor, but elsewhere we’re seeing less direct competitors, such as Arc Raiders, which looks to be an exceptional release in the extraction shooter scene. Regardless of how things play out, Call of Duty hasn't had such a contested release for years. Such are the dangers of sitting on the throne for too long.</p><p>However, even when online sentiment seems stacked against Call of Duty, there are several factors to why Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may not be popping off too much on Steam ahead of its release. For one, between 2018 and 2022, Activision has been selling Call of Duty titles on <a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, which previously was home to just Blizzard games. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/call-of-duty-stint-on-battle-net-was-supposedly-a-resounding-failure-3468723">This ended up being a bad move for Call of Duty</a>'s PC performance, but it's entirely possible that a portion of PC players learned to see Battlenet as the go-to platform for the series.</p>
<p>Then there's the Microsoft Store on PC, another alternative to Steam that isn't nearly as popular. Nonetheless, Microsoft made a real effort to push Call of Duty on Game Pass (both for console and PC) with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">breaking records for the service as a result</a>. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7 is releasing on Game Pass day one next month</a>, which could certainly account for a sizeable portion of the PC playerbase.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there's the fact that Call of Duty has always had a strong foothold on consoles. On day four of the FTC vs Microsoft hearing, former Activision Blizzard King CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> <a href="https://x.com/DeekeTweak/status/1676068765560127489/photo/1">stated that only 25% of Call of Duty daily active players were on PC</a>, based on 70m daily active users. It's worth noting that 51% of that figure would be attributed to Call of Duty Mobile, and that these are stats for Call of Duty in general, not just the latest mainline Call of Duty release. Regardless, PC is a sizeable slice of the overall playerbase, but a big slice either way.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Activision</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With all this in mind, what does this say for Call of Duty right now? Black Ops 7 will, in all likelihood, still sell like hot chocolate on a cold day. Perhaps these early indicators of Steam interest (or lack thereof) hints at the consequences years of varying PC storefront strategies can have on early adoption on the platform, rather than some drastic fumble from the FPS giant.</p><p>Or maybe it's one small crack in faded armour. Time will ultimately tell if Call of Duty manages to maintain its stranglehold on the genre it's dominated for so long (as well as the fall season, in general), or whether Battlefield 6 and other big releases can capitalise on a general fatigue within the FPS genre to really mix up the shooter space in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>We've said so much over the years about this incredible entry from Nintendo, we won't go over it all again here. But <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1982703457338540178">a recent post</a> from ex-Nintendo developer Takaya Imamura caught our eye and we simply felt compelled to highlight it, if only for how old it instantly made us feel.</p>
<p>Imamura-san highlighted Odyssey's anniversary and drew an amusing comparison to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>. Essentially, eight years prior to the N64 classic puts Nintendo right in the middle of the Famicom/NES days. The company would subsequently launch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a><em>,</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land_2_6_golden_coins">Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island</a> all before our favourite plumber would dive headfirst into the 3D realm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It’s unbelievable that this is a game from 8 years ago! Eight years before Super Mario 64 was still the heyday of the Famicom, and I myself was a student back then."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, since Odyssey, we've had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Super Mario Maker 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. Sigh... it's a different world we live in now, huh?</p>
<p>Naturally, we're confident Nintendo is simply taking its time to ensure it delivers a new 3D Mario title worthy of its remarkable legacy, but it just goes to show how quickly the company could churn out bonafide classics back in the '80s and '90s.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, however, if nothing else it just makes us feel so very, very old. How has it been eight years already? That's nearly a <em>decade</em>, for goodness' sake!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode-officially-called-battlefield-redsec-launches-tomorrow.1335916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Battlefield 6 battle royale mode has finally been revealed and will officially be called Battlefield REDSEC. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-shadow-drop-next-week-rumour/">As rumoured</a>, it'll launch tomorrow, and it'll be free-to-play.</p>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios revealed the mode with <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1982824837849760155">a short post on the official Battlefield X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, which included a link to a gameplay trailer that'll go live tomorrow, alongside the mode itself going live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We'll have more official knowledge on the mode tomorrow when the gameplay trailer goes live, which will likely <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news">be followed by a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a>, though for now we do have other claims from ModernWarzeon, the X (formerly Twitter) account who initially leaked the REDSEC title and correctly claimed it would be shadow dropped tomorrow.</p>



<p>According to ModernWarzone, Battlefield REDSEC will arrive with a Duos and Squads queues, letting players hop in as teams of two or teams of four, with a maximum player count of 100 players for matches.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 BF6 BR LAUNCH PLAYLIST 🚨</p><p>EXCLUSIVE: Duos (2) and Squads (4) is currently planned to be the ONLY team sizes available at launch for the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale / RedSec.</p><p>So with 100 player count max thats a total of 25 teams of 4 or 50 teams of 2 in every match of RedSec <a href="https://t.co/Uy2D7vlCUh">pic.twitter.com/Uy2D7vlCUh</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1982171308839276707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC will also be arriving alongside Season 1 for Battlefield 6, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">which, as I noted in my preview,</a> is adding a couple of stellar Conquest maps with Blackwell Ridge and Eastwood, but a couple of lacklustre game modes with the permanent and limited time modes to come. What makes the arrival of REDSEC even more exciting is that it'll be a peek at what is arguably going to be the best map in Battlefield 6, Eastwood, since the opening map for REDSEC is set in Southern California.</p>



<p>REDSEC is EA and Battlefield Studio's response to Call of Duty: Warzone, and it could not have come at a more opportune time for Battlefield since the Call of Duty brand <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-identity-concerns-black-ops-6-carry-forward-black-ops-7/">continues to be in an identity crisis</a>. It also seems like EA and Battlefield Studios are taking advantage of Battlefield 6 launching more than a month ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, capitalizing on FPS players who would otherwise be spending their time waiting for the new Call of Duty to release.</p>



<p>Of course, they could still be doing that while playing Battlefield 6, dropping it for Black Ops 7 when that arrives in November, but for now EA has the chance to get its hooks into players that would otherwise not give Battlefield the time of day. We'll see how REDSEC does when it arrives tomorrow.</p>

            <p>What happened today? Well, Astarion said something sassy, Lae'zel tried to teach Gale how to build a shed, and Shadowheart wrote a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a> of Shar-themed parody of 'Is This The Way To Amarillo'. That's about how I imagine the journal entries a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mod lets you write as part of an impressive in-game diary system will go.</p>
<p>Well, that and at least 100 words per day of moaning about having a little squid thing in your brain.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The mod's dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/19332?tab=description">Tav's Journal</a> and has been developed by Mazzle23. It repurposes a clever tool they created for custom in-game mod instruction pages the other month, letting the player take simple quest logs and turn them into detailed diaries packed with entries in which you can document whatever you like. So, when you look back through the events of a playthrough, instead of Larian's default synopses, you'll have unique personal records of what you were doing or thinking at whatever point.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's aimed at the likes of those who get really deep into roleplaying or completionists who might be noting down details to return to, taking the sort of writing you might have done on a physical notepad up until now into the game itself.</p><p>Assuming you're in it to feel more in the shoes of your tadpole-brained adventurer, you can kick off as you would in physical DnD by filling out the character profile and biography section for your character. Mazzle23 boasts of "large text areas for detailed storytelling and notes", so feel free to go full War and Peace if you've time and a person in mind whose life thus far can't be summed up swiftly. Handily for more verbose narrative-weaving entries, the mod's diaries come with their own auto-save system and the ability to jump between editing and read-only modes.</p>
<p>They also include two kinds of to-do list, with the one for long-term goals mirroring the usual quest log, while the other provides for day-specific tasks "tied to particular journal entries" which I assume you'll set up yourself. 'Tell Gale he smells, then laugh when he cries' for instance.</p>
<p>The aesthetically-pilled will be glad to learn that the mod boasts some visual customisation too, with six page themes to pick from and multiple fonts, in case you can't feel truly at one with your dwarf unless you're scrawling across a stone tablet in Comic Sans. Any worries about having to ruin previous work in order to tailor a diary to a fresh playthrough have been planned for, with each character being able to create and maintain their own simultaneously, while you can also duplicate journals if you want templates or backup copies.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a really impressive thing to have pulled off, with Mazzle23 noting than an option to export journals as PDFs and auto-tracking for in-game stats are among the additions they're working on for future updates. If you fancy giving BG3 journaling a go, you'll need grab both the <a href="https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se/releases">BG3 script extender</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18883?tab=description">Mazzle's EZ-Documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>
Is it bad that I find the office labyrinth of Pager rather cosy? Is it a sign that I have finally gone full 9-to-5 zombie? Or have I simply been mugged on Memory Lane by a composite of 90s aesthetics and technologies - pebbly Macintosh wallpaper patterns, mock-Bauhaus prints and yes, pagers, though I never owned one of those as a kid. 
</p>
<p>
I even like the background whine of the omnipresent CCTV cameras, which grows abruptly piercing as I walk beneath them. These are very much the wrong emotions for anything that bills itself as influenced by Kafka. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Kafka genre, I am sorry.

<p>
Created by the evidently self-deprecating bilge, and available in full now on <a href="https://bilgetbd.itch.io/pager/devlog/1095316/pager-full-version-is-out-now">Itch.io</a> with a browser demo, Pager is 60 floors worth of laidback 1-bit dread. You are some kind of office worker. Your boss sends you instructions via pager. The instructions tend to be things like "take this box to room 4". You go to room 4 and it's full of fish swimming by the light of distant stars. The next instruction is to jump three times. Pager does not have a jump button.
</p><p>
It's a gentle spoof of corporate ladder-climbing, a send-up of arbitrary and unknowable bosses and bureaucracies. It mixes humour with horror with a surprising sleepiness. There are a couple of soft jump-scares in the demo, but I was more unnerved by the crackling noise emitted by the butterfly you occasionally find perched on a coffee cup. Butterflies should not crackle. Still, even the butterflies can't wholly undermine the peace I glean from these mostly dark rooms full of dotcom memorabilia. Kafka aside, Pager's inspirations include Severance, Lynch, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Serial Experiments Lain and Sonny Boy. If I have accidentally invented the cosy Lain-alike, I am sorry.
</p>
<p>
I'm not as bowled over by the demo (which includes the first 10 floors) as I thought I might be, after cooing over the screens. I think the scenarios could be longer, and perhaps wittier. They have a certain dad joke energy, at times - a touch of WarioWare minigame, but couched in a way that leads you to expect something more fiendish.</p>
<p>The developer comments on the Itch.io page that Pager "shouldn't give you any satisfaction", and do you know, I feel like I might ultimately be dissatisfied by a game that declines to give me any satisfaction. But perhaps it's a wind-up - the trailer includes a few scenarios that seem more elaborate and chilling, and the individual puzzles appear to follow a larger story. At the very least, I think it's worth you firing up the demo, especially if you think human art peaked with the launch of Kid Pix. Pager is also available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810550/PAGER/">Steam</a>.

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Right now, the 15.6-inch HP laptop is down to $499, after a steep 71% off its original price of nearly $1,700.</a> You’re saving an unbelievable $1,200, and this model is only $100 more than the entry-level version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It’s also the lowest we’ve seen it drop to in 30 days. Act fast to grab yours, as the discount might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Responsive, Fast Performance for Work and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. You’re getting that sleek silver finish in a slim, portable frame. It’s lightweight enough to carry around all day without feeling like it’s dragging your shoulder down. Power-wise, though, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>The laptop is powered by an Intel N100 processor (quad-core, up to 3.4GHz) for responsive performance for all your tasks. It’s not built for heavy creative workloads, but it’ll handle most regular workdays without slowing you down. With the processor, you’ve got 32GB of RAM for efficient multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that offers a huge space to store all that you own. It also runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll get to work on one of the most user-friendly, efficient systems out there.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD anti-glare display pushes detailed visuals that are easier on the eyes. Whether you’re working on presentations or watching a movie, picture quality stays vibrant and sharp. Battery life is just as impressive. Most of it will depend on how you use it, of course, but you can expect to get through a few hours without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a full set of modern connectivity options that include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and a smart AC power pin. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Considering how you’d normally pay over $1,000 for a device with all these features, grabbing the laptop for under $500 feels like a steal</a>. It’s got impressive visuals, a reliable processor, sufficient space, and much more at a discount. Again, we don’t expect the offer to last long, which is why it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-next-xbox-could-be-the-first-console-to-kill-the-multiplayer-paywall.1335901/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For over two decades, Microsoft has been charging Xbox owners anywhere from $4 to $10 a month for access to online multiplayer. The full suite of features was bundled as Xbox Live Gold and has since morphed into being part of Game Pass. The company is now reportedly exploring doing away with that fee for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">its next-gen console</a>, bringing it more in-line with PC gaming where the perk is provided by companies for free.</p> <p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">by<em> Windows Central</em></a>, the “current plan” is for the next Xbox to have no paywall for multiplayer. The outlet adds that “it remains to be seen if that plan actually plays out into reality,” but it sounds like there is at least serious consideration within Microsoft for abandoning the last remnants of its Xbox Live legacy with the arrival of the new system or systems which are currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">rumored to be releasing near the end of 2027</a>.</p>

 <p>It would be another seismic shift for the company’s gaming division which has long collected this multiplayer tax in exchange for the ability to play annual hits like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>NBA2K </em>online. While it’s become standard to allow players on console to access free-to-play games without making them pay for platform memberships, forcing players to pay for online gameplay in premium titles like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> has generated massive amounts of what feels like effectively passive income for the respective console makers.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how many of Game Pass’ millions of subscribers are currently enrolled simply to play with friends online, but that benefit alone is responsible for a huge portion of the cost of the most expensive tier of the program. While Game Pass Ultimate for console users <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">was recently raised to $3</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">0</a>, the service is still just $16.50 on PC where <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and other live-service hits can all be played online for free. Ditching the multiplayer paywall on a more Windows PC-like next-gen Xbox would also require overhauling those pricing schemes.</p> <p>If the plan does go through, there will be two immediate questions: Why did Microsoft spend all of those previous years charging Xbox users for multiplayer? And how will Sony and Nintendo continue to justify charging for multiplayer on the upcoming PlayStation 6 and current Switch 2? Competition between platforms is good, and Microsoft providing valuable and meaningful alternatives in the future would be one way to help pressure both Sony and Nintendo into doing the same.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s regular slew of updates continues, and fresh off the back of another Fortnitemares event, the final part of Chapter 6 will begin after a special live event to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season.</p>



<p>Following on from the Star Wars-themed mini-season earlier this year, The Simpsons will drop with a special Springfield map to explore, including various POIs, alongside a new Battle Pass, weapons, and more content.</p>



<p>A special live event is planned in Fortnite to mark the start of The Simpsons mini-season, and we’ve got all the details on what time you need to be in the game to catch it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-fortnite-live-event">When is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was all yellow. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Epic Games has confirmed the live event for Fortnite ahead of The Simpsons mini-season will take place on Saturday, November 1.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited, and heavily rumoured, Simpsons-themed season will bring down the curtain on Chapter 6, with one month of themed content before the jump into Chapter 7 in December.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1982818597702713829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games’ tweet</a> confirming the live event announced that the alien duo Kang and Kodos will have a “special announcement” for players to watch in-game, which will likely be followed by a period of downtime before The Simpsons mini-season kicks off properly.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-fortnite-live-event">What Time is The Fortnite Live Event?</h2>



<p><strong>The live event ahead of The Simpsons mini-season in Fortnite will begin at 11 AM ET, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Expect the servers to be extremely busy, as they always are for the live events, and enter the game in advance of that time to secure your spot. At this stage, it’s unclear whether PvP will be turned off for the duration of the event to allow players to tune into the action without the threat of elimination.</p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve highlighted the start time of the Fortnite live event in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Fortnite Live Event Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 PM – Nov. 1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

After a failed mission wipes Decem’s memories, set out to relearn the reason for his existence by retrieving memory fragments scattered across a futuristic utopia. Along the way, seek out the dark secrets behind the seemingly perfect world Decem was created to maintain.</p><p>Dash and slash through Mirrormares, mental anguish manifesting as mechanized foes. Decem leaves a temporary trail of light in his wake, and his Spatial Retrace ability stops time, empowering him to instantly teleport back to any point of the trail. Retrace to set up enemy-interrupting surprise attacks from unexpected angles, and solve mind-bending puzzles where the confines of time and space block the path forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Battle behemoth mechanical bosses with tactical thinking and keen spatial awareness, manipulating time and space to Decem’s will. Create a personalized fight style with seven Primary Combat Modules and twenty Secondary Modules for a custom combination of light and heavy strikes, charge attacks, counters, stances, and much more.</p><p>Encounter other Enforcers, learn about their missions, and explore a visually stunning world across crumbling ruins and bustling cities. Discover the forgotten past and determine humanity’s future in one of five multiple endings.

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft revolutionized online multiplayer in the console space with Xbox Live in 2002. And ever since then, playing games online has come at a cost for Xbox owners. But that might not be the case going forward with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/">the next-gen Xbox system</a>, according to a new report.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more" rel="nofollow ">Windows Central</a> states that "the current plan is for the next Xbox specifically to have no paywall for multiplayer." This would be a notable change, as an (at least) Xbox Game Pass Essential subscription is needed for online multiplayer for Xbox at this time. However, Microsoft doesn't charge for access to free-to-play multiplayer games, like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone--two of the most popular games in the world.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Another reason for this possible change comes from the fact Windows Central reports that the next-gen Xbox will offer a console experience combined with a full Windows PC interface, if desired. As such, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds</a>, the next-gen Xbox would then allow access to various PC storefronts, such as Steam and <a href="http://battle.net/" rel="nofollow ">Battle.net</a>. If Microsoft were to keep charging for online multiplayer, then the theory goes those owners might just forgo the Xbox Store and utilize Steam instead on the device.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">next Xbox would be "a very premium, very high-end curated experience."</a> She also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">reconfirmed that Xbox was working on new hardware</a>, after rumors surfaced that Microsoft might exit the console space.</p><p>Microsoft is also apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-xbox-cloud-gaming-plan-with-ads-is-officially-in-testing-microsoft-confirms/1100-6535714/">testing out a free Xbox Cloud Gaming plan with ads</a>. This would have players watch a couple of minutes of video ads, for example, before having access to a curated selection of games or possibly ones they already own. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/">Halo games will be on PlayStation going forward</a>, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>

When asked whether Halo Studios used AI in any capacity, whether that be retouching assets or rebuilding environments, Conn explained that AI can streamline workflows, but people create the games.</p>

<p>"I want to be very clear … People are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows. It can do things for the game," Conn said. "But I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and there’s an opportunity to improve a workflow, or something along those lines, we’ll look at it again. It really should be additive to the creation of a game."</p><p>Hermann echoed Conn's sentiment, explaining that, like other tools developers use when making games--such as Photoshop or Unity--AI is simply the same thing. It's the brush that helps the artist paint. It can aid in the execution, but it's people who hold the creative spark.</p><p>"It's a tool in a toolbox," Hermann said. "I may go a little off message here, but some of that gets very challenging when we look at how integrated AI is becoming within our tooling. We use Photoshop. There's generative fill, for example. The boundary lines can get a little fuzzy. I will say, though, again, to Damon's point, it really is about that creative spark that comes from people and improving just overall workflows."</p><p>The question remains of whether Halo Studios was required to use generative AI when making the game. And for that, an Xbox representative told Rolling Stone that no such mandate exists.</p><p>"There is no mandate to use generative AI in our game development, and that includes Halo: Campaign Evolved," the Xbox representative told the publication in a later statement.</p><p>This comes at an interesting time for Microsoft/Xbox and the games industry at large. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-admits-xbox-hasnt-protected-its-creative-teams-but-doing-so-is-very-important/1100-6535690/" data-ref-id="1100-6535690">recently admitted</a> that the company doesn't always do the best at protecting the creativity of its staff. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> despite the myriad layoffs, with a report suggesting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the company's astronomical profit goals could be doing more harm to Microsoft</a> than good. And some studios, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">Krafton Inc.</a>, are going all in artificial intelligence, with prominent developers saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">the technology should be embraced</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devs-who-dont-embrace-ai-are-selling-themselves-short-ex-god-of-war-dev-says/1100-6535614/" data-ref-id="1100-6535614">game developers are selling themselves short</a>.</p><p>Still, it's quite fascinating to see an Xbox exclusive make the jump to PlayStation. It really does seem like Microsoft is leaning into its latest marketing strategy, which purports that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">everything is an Xbox</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-next-car-could-also-be-your-xbox-thanks-to-lg-and-cloud-gaming/1100-6534573/" data-ref-id="1100-6534573">even your car</a>.</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch sometime in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Co-op ghost hunting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is, somewhat surprisingly, being made into a board game.</p>
<p>Images and a teaser video for the project were shared over the weekend, showing a cardboard tile, card and dice-based reinterpretation of the game playable by four people. Build a haunted property using the tiles, fill it with randomised items, draw a Ghost Type card from the Investigation Pile, pair it with a randomised evidence pool, and get going.</p>
<p>There's a Ghost Behaviour board that keeps the ghost's actions feeling unpredictable as you play, and as your sanity depletes (as it does in the video game), the ghost becomes more aggressive. I don't quite know how you'll make it scary without all the set dressing and sound effects that accompany the video game experience, but perhaps the tension will translate - who knows? Maybe play it in a haunted house just in case?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia: The Board Game</a> is being made in collaboration with Lost in Cult, which is better known for making bespoke physical editions of culty video games. Phasmophobia will actually be the first board game it's made, it seems.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now open ahead of the board game's estimated Q4 2026 release date. A standard version of Phasmophobia: The Board Game will cost you £80, and a deluxe edition - which features glow in the dark hand prints and foil-backed cards, among other things - will cost £120.</p><p>Phasmophobia has been a phenomenal success as a video game, selling more than 25 million copies and transforming the life of originating solo developer Daniel Knight. I went to meet him earlier this year to hear and then tell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">his incredible Phasmophobia success story</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-could-be-playing-vanquish-right-now.1335862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You. Yes, you!&nbsp; The person reading this. Have you ever strolled down the street on a crisp autumn day and thought to yourself “I could be playing the 2010 action game <em>Vanquish</em>, developed by PlatinumGames at the peak of their mastery, at this very moment?” If that thought has ever crossed your mind, then I have good news for you. There is, in fact, very little stopping you from playing one of the best action games ever made provided you have about twenty dollars and a platform to play it on.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you do not know <em>Vanquish</em>, or only know about it vaguely by reputation, I’m excited for you. You may have overlooked it at the time because it was a third person cover shooter in 2010 and generally Japan was in a patchy place with releases in that era. Imagine the general growling tone and demeanor of <em>Gears of War</em>, but now imagine if it has held up well. You play Sam Gideon, voiced by Gideon Emery, an actor who also voiced Gideon in <em>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</em>. Sam is a guy who works for DARPA, which in this universe is like being a Jedi.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Vanquish by DECosmic in 1:25:08 - Summer Games Done Quick 2021 Online" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3MDo9HmUMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Vanquish is basically if a cover shooter was a SHMUP, a dynamic that inverts the flow of a stodgy subgenre that died an ignoble death for good reason. Gideon’s suit primarily lets him do two things: slow down time in small increments or rocket boost while sliding on his knees. Instead of the chunky “roadie run”, you’re flying. You can also end a slide by meleeing quite hard, which sends an enemy flying and feels phenomenal. Like <em>Godhand, </em>parts of <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>and the oft-overlooked GameCube game <em>P.N.03</em> before it, Vanquish has a performative, arcade-y feel as each encounter is aggressively scored. This is not meant to be a game that you consume and forget about, but a game where every encounter can be analyzed and replayed. Like<em> Ninja Gaiden</em>, you are meant to get better at playing <em>Vanquish</em>, and speedruns of the game are truly harrowing to watch. </p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now is as good a time as any to bring up the fact that Sam Gideon smokes a whole lot. This is the extent of what many people know about this game, the left bumper lets Sam light up a cig and throw it while behind cover, which has tactical uses if you want to distract enemy fire. Though I personally think smoking is a terrible idea and have avoided it most of my life, it also makes Sam look cool as hell, which is not something you are supposed to admit any more. That said he’s also a cyborg or cyborg-adjacent, maybe he can’t get emphysema. I think we should encourage more cyborgs to blast cigs in games, because I simply don’t see that a lot in my day-to-day life.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thoroughly explaining the plot of <em>Vanquish </em>would not really not benefit you that much. Some rough notes though: San Francisco gets hit with an orbital death laser that causes people to start exploding. President Elizabeth Winters, who looks suspiciously like Hillary Clinton (a move 2012’s <em>Black Ops II </em>would also pull) sends you to retaliate against Russia in orbit. This involves sending a galactic fleet to one of those rotating wheel space stations like in <em>Citizen Sleeper </em>or <em>Gundam.</em> Gideon’s coworkers are a woman floating in a holographic <em>Minority Report </em>interface named Elena, a bunch of marines, and a gigantic pissed guy named Lt. Col. Robert Burns, who looks like he’s there to directly make fun of <em>Gears of War</em>. They got veteran voice actor Steve Blum, voice of Spike Spiegel, to play Burns and both him and Gideon Emery are constantly growling at each other in such a similar timbre that you could mistake them for the same guy. If <em>Gears of War </em>is the goofy crystallization of the post-Iraq invasion, oorah pissed guy culture, then <em>Vanquish </em>is what happens when Japanese creators turn it inside out.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Vanquish </em>was directed by Shinji Mikami and is the peak of his career post-Capcom. It’s easy to directly draw a throughline through the games he directed previously; the same lighthearted goofiness that’s in <em>God Hand</em> can be seen poking through, particularly when you dropkick an enemy in the stomach after rocketsliding at about fifty miles an hour. It also immediately preceded PlatinumGames’ work on <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em>, one of the best games ever made and debatably the best <em>Metal Gear </em>game if you’re the kind of person that likes being confrontational with strangers on the internet. If you enjoy watching a cyborg do some of the sickest shit you’ve ever seen, either game will serve you well.</p><p>Replaying <em>Vanquish</em> is a reminder that, as the saying goes, they simply don’t make them like this any more. I know that my love of <em>Vanquish</em> is not tinted by the specific familiarity that comes from playing a weird game when it comes out, because I played it only in the last few years at the badgering of friends who kept saying “man, you <em>gotta </em>play <em>Vanquish</em>.” Few games like this stand the test of time and feel this good even now. They remastered the game a few years ago and rereleased it along with <em>Bayonetta</em>. Hell, you can throw it on your Steam Deck and it handles it with little trouble.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: SEGA</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Vanquish </em>is also a bittersweet game in context because it’s debatable that the PlatinumGames that made this game as well as the specific environment that fostered it into being still exist. Platinum has had a few rough years lately. Their last big game was <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>and the less said about <em>Babylon’s Fall </em>the better. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-loses-more-game-directors-reveals-former-vice-president-hideki-kamiya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Much of its staff left</a> and most of its prominent figures have gone off to do their own thing. Mikami himself went to found Tango Gameworks and left it in 2023 before its closure by Microsoft and revival by Krafton, only then found another studio named Kamuy. One hopes that <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> can herald a turning point for Platinum; there are hints of the old Platinum buried in that deeply confusing game. That said, the task of being forced to do the lion’s share of Team Ninja’s dirty work in recreating a technical masterpiece while also being published by <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios in 2025</a> are not things I would wish on my worst enemy.</p><p>But perhaps it is more productive to focus on the good times, on a single, impossible game like <em>Vanquish</em>, which can be bought for just under twenty American dollars, often less, and which you may have sitting in your Steam library right now, waiting for a moment like this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I love a good escape room, heading to an often rather innocuous door or shopfront in a less-than-prominent position in town, and then heading into a themed room that’s filled with themed puzzles and secrets to unpick. Since 2020, there’s been more than a few attempts to translate this experience to one you can enjoy at home, and between escape room envelopes, advent calendars, and online portals, it’s video games that manage to capture the tone best of all. Escape Simulator 2 is the latest, thoroughly enjoyable escape room puzzler.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Simulator 2 - Coming October 27th to Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rRqKQMewWy8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s an immediacy to Escape Simulator 2’s puzzle rooms, as you simply appear in a space and start running around, finding puzzles and clues, and putting the pieces together. There’s no preamble, no big cutscenes and drama, you’re just chucked into the three distinct settings and themes –&nbsp;Dracula’s Castle, the sci-fi themed Starship EOS and the piratical The Cursed Treasure. That said, there is a throughline to each setting’s collection of four puzzle rooms, the rooms connecting well from the end of one to the start of the next.</p>


<p>There’s a really pleasing interactivity to all the environments, letting you pick up so many incidental items, inspecting books and scraps of paper, dragging crates across the floor, spinning and sitting around in chairs, filling your inventory with all manner of tools, and the like. Anything you grab that’s important is generally quite obvious, with giant gems, special keys and statue pieces, but they are marked with an icon just to be clear. It is important to mess around in these spaces, though, as there’s a lot of visual clues tucked away in corners and on ceilings –&nbsp;not to mention puzzle pieces that are hidden everywhere for pictures back in the lobby.</p>


<p>Oh, and this can all be played in co-op, and I played through the whole game with my better half. So much of the escape room feel comes from playing them with friends and family, where you can all go off and work on your own puzzles, compare discoveries, ask for and offer help, and you have that exact same feel in Escape Simulator 2. Right down to not really having a clue what your teammates have found and done half the time! That said, Pine Studio say that you can play with up to 8 players online, and while that might be possible, I’d say that the included rooms are going to be best with 2-4 players. You can often all look at a puzzle together, with everyone’s cursors floating around together.</p>
<p>So far, so similar to the original game, but Escape Simulator 2 does push in a new visual direction. There’s more darkness, there’s more detailed environments and characters compared to the more cartoony original, and it generally looks good, but there are plenty of quirks and rougher edges to the game’s presentation in general.</p>

<p>There’s no clipping with other people that you’re playing with –&nbsp;quite necessary if there’s going to be eight running around –&nbsp;and that leads to plenty of looking through unintentionally bald heads, or being half through someone’s head. There’s some odd or missing animations both in first and third person. Things like climbing out of a cryo bed or shifting from a ladder, or a puzzle suddenly shifting you to a completely different perspective with no explanation, and a bunch of other examples. It just takes a few seconds to figure out what’s happened, but it takes you out of the moment as you go “wait, what just happened?” I also wish that, since you can share a view of a puzzle screen, you could also share the clues you’re trying to use –&nbsp;these you can pin on screen, which is rather handy.</p>
<p>Similarly, the hints system is a little odd sometimes. It has to cater to a lot of freeform puzzling, and on the few occasions that we used it, it did generally do well – it spawns a paper diagram so you can pass this and share it with others –&nbsp;but there were a couple points where it wasn’t offering us any hints. That was particularly annoying at the end of the Starship EOS series, with what’s likely the penultimate puzzle being a pure puzzle with no hints. We’ll have to go back and finish this another time.</p>

<p>So it’s a little bit ropey in some ways, but then, what escape room isn’t? This takes you to more fantastical locations than an in person escape room could possibly hope to, and there’s a bright future for this game with both DLC from Pine Studios and a second generation of the Room Editor – I’ve not experimented with this, but over 4,000 rooms were built in the first game, and the tools here are more extensive again.</p>

			<p>The current generation of Xbox and PlayStation consoles is now more than five years old, making it well past the time we would start hearing about what the next generation of consoles will look like. We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">seen several rumours</a> on what the next-generation Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">hardware will include</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">on top of comments</a> from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-president-says-game-exclusives-are-antiquated/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a>, a picture of Xbox's next console is starting to form. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Windows Central</a> seems to piece it together a bit more clearly, framing the next Microsoft console as a best of both worlds between the PC and console experience.</p>



<p>The report leans both on comments from Microsoft executives like Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer and sources who spoke to Windows Central, so understand that nothing about this is finalized, but it does paint a picture that makes sense as to what the next console from Microsoft will look like.</p>



<p>Both Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond have alluded to the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X handhelds</a> as a peek at Microsoft's thinking for its next generation of hardware, with the Xbox Play Anywhere becoming more of the focus with all Xbox games being playable on the Xbox PC app and Xbox consoles moving forward.</p>



<p>According to Windows Central's report, what those allusions mean is that the next-generation Xbox console will provide a console experience with its UI and the ability to natively play console games, though its foundation will be that of "<em>a curated Windows gaming PC</em>."</p>



<p>Basically, you'll be able to access your Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, and Battle.net games just like you're able to on a PC, with the Xbox Full-Screen Experience that's currently live on the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Ally handhelds acting as the home base for the device. On top of all those libraries, you'll also be able to access and play all the games currently playable on your Xbox Series X/S consoles, including original Xbox titles, Xbox 360 games, and your full catalogue of backwards compatible titles already available on Series X/S.</p>



<p>Another part of what'll make this device a 'best of both worlds' between console and PC is that the paywall for playing online multiplayer games will be removed for the next generation. Since the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 days, console players have had to pay for the ability to play multiplayer games online, whereas that has never been the case for PC players. That paywall will finally be removed with Microsoft's next console, according to this report, to further align itself with the PC gaming experience this new device is allegedly trying to provide.</p>



<p>Of course, this will also come with more changes to the structure of Microsoft's Game Pass service, though those details aren't clear, and likely won't be until we're much closer to the actual release of next-generation hardware.</p>



<p>It's an interesting proposal, to say the least, that we'll finally see a combination of PC perks like having access to multiple gaming libraries and not having to pay for online multiplayer on top of the ease-of-use that consoles provide. If Microsoft can execute on it all, that is.</p>

Whether you’re upgrading from a previous version of the Pixel Watch, or jumping right in with Google’s ecosystem, you’re picking a good smartwatch that’s $150 cheaper than the superb <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795383/google-pixel-watch-4-review-android-smartwatch-gemini-wearable">Pixel Watch 4</a>. <em>Verge </em>reviewer Victoria Song praised the brighter screens, better battery life, and the smaller bezels of the entire Pixel Watch 3 line. She also singled out the 45mm model because “it wears small,” and because its larger size means that its 35-percent bigger battery (compared to the 41mm edition) lets it last longer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable">Read our review.</a></span></li><li><span>It’s not common for <strong>Nintendo’s Joy-Con controllers</strong> for the Switch to get any sort of meaningful discount, but you can get a set of neon pink and green ones at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fjoy-con-l-r-wireless-controllers-for-nintendo-switch-neon-pink-neon-green%2FJ7GSL57SJ7" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $64.99 (was $89.99). These can slide onto a Nintendo Switch, of course, but they’re compatible wirelessly with a Switch 2 console, as well. If you want to recharge them via your Switch 2, you’ll need an extra accessory for that, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2N1GPK8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Fastsnail’s $19.99 product</a> that can simultaneously charge any combination of four Joy-Con or Joy-Con 2.</span></li><li><span>Workout gear can get expensive, but good sweat-ready wireless earbuds don’t need to cost you dearly. <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X20</strong> are down to their lowest price yet at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-True-Wireless-Extendable-Cancelling-Waterproof/dp/B0CRT6HQ82/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, costing $55.99 (was $79.99, but the previous best was $64). These are built to be a ready-for-anything companion, with an IP68 rating that ensures that they’re waterproof, dustproof, and sweatproof. In terms of fit, these stand out compared to other similarly-priced options because of their rotatable and extendable ear hooks. Personally, I don’t trust earbuds to stay in my ears (my ear fin-equipped Pixel Buds Pro 2 struggle to stay put), but the hooks make them seem like a great, no-fuss option. Not only that, they offer active noise cancellation and 12 hours per charge (up to 48 hours if you refill them in the included charging case).</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/806949/ps5-ps-plus-premium-console-bundle-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you don’t have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If you’re in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount.</a> This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Richer Sound, Both Indoor and Outdoor</h2>
<p>The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. You’ll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. You’re getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, you’ll get clear sound without distortion.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when you’re not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? There’s a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; you’re looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, that’s going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyone’s favorite playlists get a chance!</p>



<p>The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if you’re planning to host larger gatherings.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. It’s compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">It’s down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the deal’s still live.</a></p>

<p>A new report says a new Xbox Partner Preview is scheduled for November and will focus heavily on Xbox Play Anywhere games. </p>



<p>Xbox has been in the news recently due to fresh details about its next-gen consoles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sucked in trainers from across the world, and Season 2 of Ranked is now right around the corner with a fresh batch of rewards to claim.</p>



<p>The first Pokémon release on Nintendo Switch 2, albeit still available on the original console, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-first-week-sales-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached some impressive sales milestones</a>, and the four-player PvP offerings have sucked plenty in for the grind.</p>



<p>If you’re ready to dive back into Ranked in pursuit of the next batch of rewards in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Earn the right. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 2 of Ranked in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A begins on November 4, immediately following the conclusion of Season 1 Ranked.</strong></p>



<p>It may seem like it has come around swiftly, with it only being a few weeks since the release of Legends: Z-A, but it appears, at least initially, that Ranked seasons in the title will transition rather quickly.</p>



<p>Based on the information we have from Season 1, each season in Ranked will last for around four weeks. However, this may be extended later in the game’s lifespan, depending on what else Game Freak have cooking.</p>







<p><strong>Although not officially announced, we expect Season 2 of Ranked in <strong>Pokémon</strong></strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A to begin at 6 AM UTC on November 4—the same time that Season 1 began.</strong></p>



<p>The table below shows a breakdown of when you can expect Season 2 of Ranked in Legends: Z-A to begin in your time zone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Season 2 Ranked Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Nov. 3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">2 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Nov. 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 PM – Nov. 4</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>The biggest reward available in Legends: Z-A’s Season 2 of Ranked is Delphoxite, which is required to unlock Mega Delphox in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Just like Greninjite in Season 1, Delphoxite is exclusively available in Ranked play during Season 2, meaning you’ll have to delve into online play against players around the world to unlock the reward.</p>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed, but we expect the requirements to be the same as earning Greninjite in Season 1, meaning you’ll have to reach at least Rank K to obtain the item.</p>



<p>Other rewards include Rare Candies, EXP. Candies, and items will also be distributed as rewards for reaching the various levels of ranked, but full details will be shared upon release.</p>
