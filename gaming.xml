			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west-bigger-and-better-in-every-way/">Horizon Forbidden West</a> patch introduces an image treatment solution that delivers better image quality from what we have seen so far of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> discussed this new image treatment solution, saying that it delivers a pristine image quality that is close to what NVIDIA DLSS can deliver on PC and considerably better than what we have seen PSSR do so far. This solution, which is reportedly in development for Guerrilla Games' next project, is likely a compute-based solution that doesn't use the machine learning hardware of the PlayStation 5 Pro, so it could potentially run on the base console, where it could deliver much more impressive results, considering the only upscaler available on the regular PS5 is AMD FSR, which delivers some middling results, as we have seen over and over in the past few months.</p>
<p>Although the great image quality delivered by this image treatment solution could be thanks to the high base resolution (1440p / 1584p to 4K), it could also be another great option for developers, as it could allow Guerrilla or any other developer using the Decima engine, like Kojima Productions with Death Stranding 2, to use the PlayStation 5 Pro machine learning hardware to do other things.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #186: Teraflop War OVER, Killzone Dead, Alan Wake 2 PS5 Pro, Silent Hill 2 Patched!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RrGDYXvKBk?start=6024&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The superior image quality delivered by Horizon Forbidden West on PlayStation 5 Pro, thanks to this new image treatment solution, could be matched by any other game using PSSR with a high enough base resolution, as the games using the upscaler seen so far had a much lower base resolution than 1440p. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to see for ourselves what the AI-powered upscaler will be able to do under the right conditions, as the console launches next week, on November 7th, worldwide.</p>

            <p>Bungie have been fairly quiet about Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">announced in 2023</a>. Yesterday they released a devlog in which game director Joe Ziegler seemed to want to reassure fans of the studio that the game was still in development. He talked around a lot of the game features, without actually saying much about it. As yet, there's still no footage of the game in action, making its previous release window of 2025 appear even more tenuous.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Ziegler begins the video by saying there's no gameplay footage to show, and talks in some very general terms about what the game is going to be - a PvP-focused extraction shooter. Ollie has already rounded up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-release-date">everything we know about Marathon</a>, and this devlog sadly doesn't tell us anything new about the game. If anything it makes it sound less defined than before. Ziegler makes vague mention of player abilities, loot, and "runner" loadouts, while re-explaining some extraction shooter basics many first-person shooter fans will already know. He does give some indication of where the studio is in terms of production, even if he doesn't show anything.</p>
<p>"Some things are a little bit more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really, really beautiful way," he says. "Some of the character models we've been iterating through. So they're coming together but they're not fully there yet... So it's a little early to show you all of it as one piece."</p><p>There are some insubstantial teases of characters. One is codenamed "Thief" and another is codenamed "Stealth" who is unsurprisingly described as "hard to pin down". And Ziegler mentions that the studio will be recruiting more playtesters next year. He doesn't mention anything about the release date, or give much indication about other elements of the game.</p>
<p>In BBC comedy The Thick Of It, a government minister is scheduled to go on a news show. But he has absolutely nothing to announce or say. His vicious PR man, Malcolm Tucker, tells him to come up with something. "It better not be too boring," he commands. "And it better not be too interesting either, okay? And it better not cost too much. It can't be an old thing, obviously, and don't make it too new." </p>
<p>I can't help but suspect Ziegler's non-announcement is the result of the same kind of PR frogmarching and "visibility first" thinking. Bungie's silence around the game has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">not gone unnoticed</a>, and it's likely the studio wanted to simply say "our game is still alive" without actually showing any work-in-progress. Compare this to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skates-chaotic-playtest-videos-are-the-best-marketing-the-game-could-ask-for">bare-faced development</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> from Full Circle, or the almost worringly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-are-playing-valves-unrevealed-shooter-deadlock-a-blend-of-team-fortress-2-and-dota-with-bioshocky-skyrails">blas√© treatment</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> by Valve. Both of whom are happy to show things in various states of unreadiness.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, however, it's up to Bungie to decide when they feel the game is good enough to show. It's not like they have been without road blocks in development. The studio has recently seen multiple <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">management shake-ups</a> amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs</a>. Ziegler himself is directing the game after the removal of previous director, Chris Barrett, for the latter's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">allegedly inappropriate behaviour</a>. Some Bungie staff have also been reassigned to other divisions within Sony, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought the studio back in 2022</a>. None of this is likely to have helped the development of the shooter. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has an arachnophobia mode as part of its accessibility offering that turns spider-like creatures into amusing blobs.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game in the series has an open beta coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-getting-open-beta-in-november-with-early-access-for-playstation-plus-subscribers">PS Plus subscribers getting early access</a> that's now available.</p>
<p>Right at the start, players can tweak the settings and turn on Arachnophobia Assistance, which "adjusts the appearance of some small monsters and endemic life to accommodate players with arachnophobia".</p>

<p>The result is creatures becoming golden globules that wobble around environments. As an arachnophobe myself, it certainly put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>Note, however, this only applies to small monsters rather than the main monsters you'll be tasked with properly hunting.</p>

<p>That's fine for the menagerie of dragon, lizard, bear, and toad-like monsters, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4gR1QEvVA">spider-esque Lala Barina</a> seemingly won't be affected. Still, it does have four legs rather than eight - and the legs are the worst.</p>
<p>The beta also provides a look at other accessibility options, with three presets for visual, auditory, and motion sickness options. These can also be toggled individually in the options menu.</p>

<p>The arachnophobia mode is fast becoming standard in games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-an-arachnophobia-mode">World of Warcraft finally received one</a> earlier this year after 20 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 turns spiders into something even worse</a>.

<p>Elsewhere the beta (from the start at least) is the same demo I was able to play at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this year. It begins with a chase across sand dunes, before hunting a monster with an exceptionally large tongue.</p>
<p>I came away impressed with that demo, calling it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">most approachable Monster Hunter in the series yet</a>. And while that's a descriptor often used for each new game, it's a welcome evolution that streamlines the experience with tidier menus and NPC teammates.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta launches across all platforms on 31st October and lasts until 4th November. We've got all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-release-date-time-early-access">beta times in our guide</a>.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year"> full game will be released in February next year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arkham-horror-the-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween.1021809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was only three months ago that I was praising Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Hungering Abyss for its ability to teach the game, supply players with everything they'd need for a multiple-hour experience, and create an entertaining and tense spooky experience. The one major downside I had was how it really was only suited for that one experience, now with the release of the Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook in under a month we know what it will be like to create a story from scratch.</p>

<h2>Intuitive Layout</h2>

<p>Before I get into the contents of the book itself I need to highlight how incredibly well formatted the Core Rulebook is. From the moment I opened the book I could tell the time and effort that had gone into the layout. Starting with what Arkham Horror is, information about the setting of the game, and a very clear section disowning Lovecraft's beliefs, you launch into relevant information for the player.</p>

<p>You'll learn about the city of Arkham, where players might base their character, but also learn about how the game doesn't need to be restricted to Massachusetts. Examples of mysteries in Cairo or Europe, or even beyond the veil immediately start prodding at the mind of DM and player alike.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=soqQ6YNz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-the-world.jpg?itok=fkjBAbUI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there you get all the required information on the rules of the game, neatly together for easy referencing, character creation, and information for DMs.</p>

<p>If you plan to keep the book on hand while playing it should be a breeze to locate what information you're after in a pinch. On top of that, inside the cover is a code from Drivethrurpg for a PDF of the Rulebook.</p>

<h2>Rules Glossary</h2>

<p>The first major section you'll reach is the Rules Glossary. This will cover how the Dynamic Pool system works, the different types of scenes that you'll encounter and how to take actions and consequences.</p>

<p>The approach to this is bite-sized information that can continue to be built upon starting with that important Dynamic Pool. In Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game the Dynamic Pool is every, it will determine how much you can do as you investigate a location to how you can move and act in combat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=wrHusmwq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-arkham-map.jpg?itok=G9BRvTnL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players have a dice pool of six dice. As they take damage they can end up with fewer dice, hence fewer actions to make, or if they experience horrors those dice can turn against you inflicting horrors if they land with a certain face.</p>

<p>Going into the Core Rulebook with an understanding of the dice pool and how it functions after my time with Hungering Abyss the system made sense. For a player coming into this system new I do think it's a bit tough to understand initially. Like with a lot of TTRPGs there's a lot that you can read but doing the thing will normally help you understand much faster.</p>

<p>It's in this way that the introduction to the Dynamic Pool, scenes, and actions is actually better got across by Hungering Abyss in the way that the game only introduces concepts to you as they become relevant.</p>

<p>From there the bite-sized information continues and is effective in creating a glossary that is easy to reference and quick to check with clearly labeled sections and sub-sections alongside well-laid-out descriptions and even some examples for the harder-to-understand concepts.</p>

<h2>Bringing a character to life in the world of Arkham Horror</h2>

<p>There's a funny line at the beginning of the character creation that I believe sets up the world you're about to step into with Arkham Horror: The Roleplaying Game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Most of the people in Arkham, Massachusetts and around the globe spend their time dealing with the simple routines of their daily lives. [...] Your characters aren't so lucky"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Players will take on the roles of those unfortunate enough to find themselves tied to a dark and mysterious fate. These characters, dubbed investigators, might have been raised in this world or is about to get pulled from their comfy life but there's no turning back.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=Rz4XUiD7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-hunter-class.jpg?itok=8Jp0DkOh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A character is made up of a few key components; Background, Personality Trait, Archetype, Skills, and their starting equipment and advancements. In the back of the book is a blank character sheet that you can use to fill out as you go through the process of building your character up.</p>

<p>Interestingly this character sheet wasn't mentioned at the start of the character creation process, or in the table of contents.</p>

<p>A lot of these aspects aren't hard rules but instead prompts, for discovering your characters backgrounds you'll get prompted with questions like "What is your family like?" and "How does your character make a Living?" etc‚Ä¶</p>

<p>These questions then get paired with what differences there might be between a Poor upbringing and that of a Prosperous lifestyle.</p>

<p>Personality and Archetype are more set in the rules. There are eleven Personalities and eight Archetypes. You can mix and match these to finetune your character and allow for differences among characters to develop immediately.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=E3B9_BH5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-character-class.jpg?itok=7L8i2HWA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Diversify The Party</h2>

<p>As a 'Outgoing' Personality you might have the chance to perform an action with your Presence stat, but it could also negatively impact you causing Disadvantage against rolls with allies. This could be combined with a Guardian archetype to create a mayoral character who is good at communicating with their peers.</p>

<p>That same Outgoing Personality could create a vastly different character if applied to a Seeker like a private detective, or a Mystic who is able to manifest supernatural abilities.</p>

<p>Characters will progress by earning experience in sequences. This experience isn't something to fill up a meter for, but instead, it can be spent on gaining abilities. It's not as much "leveling up" but skill points to be spent on a tree.</p>

<p>A major benefit of this is that players will be able to tweak a lot more, and faster. It's not a matter of multiple sessions before you can make skill checks easier or pick up a new ability, you might be able to pick something small up at the end of an encounter or save up for something bigger.</p>

<p>The list of interesting equipment, mundane or otherwise, is like stepping into a candy store. Players will be able to obtain different armors, melee and ranged weaponry, single-use items, and even ancient tomes filled with spells.</p>

<p>Each section is filled with relevant information like gameplay mechanics, prices, and more again assisting the DM in creating a very seamless experience.</p>

<p>Mechanically I was extremely interested in the Tomes section. Unlike a Wizards book that could hold any spell the Tomes here are very specific with what information they contain, the checks that a character would need to complete to have read and understood them, and what spells can be cast with them.</p>

<p>These are definitely the rarest of the rare items for your party to come across but who wouldn't like to happen across the De Vermis Mysteriis, allowing you to enchant weapons or armor, or get your hands on the Necronomicon?</p>

<h2>The Role of the GM and Worldbuilding</h2>

<p>Moving further away from the information that the players need to know we reach the chapters with information for the Game Master. Here we have detailed information about Arkham, including the different regions of the town, important locations within them, and even a visitor-style map.</p>

<p>The section on running the game provides a variety of helpful tips and information including how to create a story, how to run the different scenes, and additional information on the tones and themes of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=A6K7F45x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-included-adventure-character.jpg?itok=fdl5qQre 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a horror game I'm extremely glad to see a section on safety rules. Not just the guidelines on how to creat lines and veils, known as Pillars and Borders in Arkham Horror, but also to omit all Xenophobia and Marginalization.</p>

<h2>What Lurks Beyond The Veil</h2>

<p>Two of the final chapters are dedicated to the different Allies and NPCs you'll be able to inject into your games, including stat blocks for all monsters. For your world building the chapter, The Ancient Ones, is your one-stop shop to understand the kinds of eldritch creatures that Lovecraft came up with.</p>

<p>Here you'll find multi-paged dossier entries on some of the big and small players of the Mythos including Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Crothhoaka, and more. Each section does an impressive job of distilling all of the information surrounding these creatures into well-formatted sections. Reading each you'll understand what they are and where their domain is, what effect they have, what their lair is like, and what kinds of allies or factions may be supporting them.</p>

<p>What I really appreciate about the introduction of what are meant to be all-powerful Old Ones is that while there's a lot of context and understanding there isn't anything mechanical to them. Sure the Star Spawn might have a reference to their power from Cthulhu but no player character would truly be able to face an Old One. Their presence helps to inform the actions of cults and other factions, instead of being the Big Bad themselves.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=6NIHXB6J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arkham-horror-rpg-core-rulebook-old-ones.jpg?itok=vySbj8zP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Time To Play</h2>

<p>Finally, the last section of the book holds with it an adventure to play. While I do still believe for new players the Hungering Abyss starter set is going to be your best 'first experience' playing, if you've already completed that and are ready for a new challenge then it's excellent to have this Core Rulebook be a one-stop-shop to your first time playing the game too.</p>



<p>I was incredibly impressed reading through the Arkham Horror Rulebook. The content of it all was extremely easy to understand and efficient, teaching you to the game quickly but also makes referencing rules while playing extremely efficient.</p>

<p>While the character sheet is tucked away the options will provide players a wide variety of options to take through their spooky adventure, and the DM is more than adequately equipped to channel a creepy vibe from beyond the veil.</p>

<p>If you're an absolutely new group to playing I would still recommend the starter set, as it comes with so many tokens, handouts, and a 'learn as you go' style rulebook but if you're a fan and you're ready to dive into your own adventures then this is an excellent Rulebook to do so.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-adds-two-spooky-n64-classics-for-halloween.1021803/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added two new N64 classics to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're in the mood for some spooky gaming this Halloween season, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>These games are being added just a couple of weeks after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie">Rare's classic 3D platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie">Banjo-Tooie</a>&nbsp;</em>was added to the Switch Online list, but the two titles being introduced today arguably couldn't be more tonally different.</p>

<p>First up, you're getting old-school action-adventure&nbsp;game&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, which blends elements of shooters, platformers, and all kinds of other genres. This isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/90s-classic-shadow-man-remastered-coming-to-pc-in-april">Nightdive's remaster</a>; it's the original N64 game, presented with all its warts intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-shadow-man-n64.jpg?itok=BTPuUdmV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-shadow-man-n64.jpg?itok=2amJDw6a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>is haunting its way into the Nintendo Switch Online archives today.</figcaption></figure><p>Also available today is&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em>, an FPS that serves as a sequel to the 1997 shooter&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, this is another game that the ever-diligent retro enthusiasts at Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/turok-2-seeds-of-evil-remastered-edition-coming-to-steam">remastered back in 2017</a>, but again, this isn't the remastered version; it's the original N64 release.</p>

<p>The release of both of these games on Nintendo Switch Online was revealed earlier today in a rather amusing (and somewhat uncharacteristic of Nintendo) trailer that calls back to the grindhouse-style trailers of the 1970s. You can check that trailer out right here.</p>




<p>There's been a fair bit of buzz around Nintendo Switch Online recently, largely thanks to a rather strange game that Switch Online Expansion Pack members were invited to playtest last week.</p>

<p>Naturally, that game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mysterious-nintendo-switch-online-playtest-leaks">almost immediately leaked</a>, and it's an odd-looking multiplayer affair that sees players teaming up to populate a planet with all kinds of construction efforts. We don't know if it'll be released outside of the playtest yet.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man&nbsp;</em>and <i>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil&nbsp;</i>are available right now for Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack members. Watch this space for more info on all things Switch Online-related.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/who-made-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-made-call-of-duty-black-ops-6.1021791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/who-made-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty has so many teams involved in its creation that it‚Äôs difficult to keep up with who‚Äôs involved and who the main company is behind its creation. Black Ops 6 introduces many new features and changes, and contrary to popular opinion, it isn‚Äôt being helmed by one company. </p>



<p>Infinity Ward officially got the CoD ball rolling with 2003‚Äôs Call of Duty and 2005‚Äôs Call of Duty 2. IW took a backseat to Treyarch in 2006 as the newbie more than adequately led Call of Duty 3. More teams have entered the conversation since, leading to players wondering who makes which games.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> is a continuation of the espionage side of Call of Duty‚Äîwith a hint of round-based Zombies thrown in for good measure. The first-person shooter was been well-recieved, and we know who‚Äôs responsible for its success.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6">Who Made Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tell me! Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Treyarch and Raven Software</strong> are behind the development and continued support of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Seeing Treyarch behind the wheel is no surprise as Black Ops is Treyarch‚Äôs baby. However, 2020‚Äôs Black Ops Cold War was the first title in the BLOPS portion of CoD to bring another team on board‚ÄîRaven Software. History has repeated itself as Black Ops 6 is officially co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software.</p>



<p>With a deep Campaign, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Liberty</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/">Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> Zombies maps (with more to come), and online multiplayer, there are a lot of plates to spin‚Äîbut we do know both teams aren‚Äôt spinning every plate though.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-the-black-ops-6-campaign">Who Made the Black Ops 6 Campaign?</h2>



<p><strong>Raven Software</strong> is actually the developer behind the dramatic, single-player Campaign. The news was confirmed by <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/24107491/black-ops-6-reveal-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision Blizzard</a> on June 9, for the Black Ops 6 Campaign reveal, ‚ÄúDevelopment on the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;Campaign is led by Raven Software.‚Äù</p>



<p>It might surprise you to know this was also the case for Black Ops Cold War. Raven handled the Campaign, whereas Treyarch focused its efforts on the Zombies and seasonal multiplayer content. The companies decided if it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. Everything you feel and experience in Black Ops 6‚Äôs Campaign is the direct result of Raven Software‚Äôs tireless efforts and creativity‚Äîand I‚Äôm not complaining as we got the unbelievable Emergence mission!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-zombies">Who Made Black Ops 6 Zombies?</h2>



<p><strong>Black Ops 6 Zombies is being handled by Treyarch</strong>‚Äîand this includes the two current maps, as well as subsequent maps arriving in the future.</p>



<p>Treyarch‚Äôs Zombies portion of Vanguard was notoriously shallow, but this is only because of a stunted development time which forced the company to strip back the popular game mode. Now, in Black Ops 6, proper round-based Zombies is back. Powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>‚Äîincluding the monstrously powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-ray-gun-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ray Gun</a>‚Äîand fun <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a> all feature prominently.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-made-black-ops-6-multiplayer">Who Made Black Ops 6 Multiplayer?</h2>



<p><strong>Treyarch is also handling the Black Ops 6 online multiplayer component</strong>, meaning they handle everything from gameplay balancing to new content to the maintenance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/are-black-ops-6-servers-down-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers</a>.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a double-barrel effort from Treyarch, but as 20-plus-year veterans, it should have no problem balancing Zombies and multiplayer. It had no problem doing this with Black Ops Cold War, so we should have a bright year ahead of us.</p>

With a positive critical response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> now safely tucked under its belt, BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> project director Michael Gamble has reflected on some of the differences between the studio's two upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which hits shops later this week, Mass Effect 5 will not seek to tweak the sci-fi franchise's established visual style, he said.
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," Gamble wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193">post</a> on X. 
</p>
<p>
"Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a sci-fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs," he continued, "and has to have different kinds of love."

<p>
Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese praised The Veilguard's divisive new graphical style in our review of the game, noting how BioWare seemed to be "aiming for something closer to an animated film in appearance". 
</p>
<p>
"It really works," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, noting how in particular it enhances facial gestures and helps draw out "the inherent fantasy and emotion in scenes and environments".

As for Mass Effect 5's tone, Gamble wrote it would "maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy. This is all I'm going to say for now."
</p>
<p>
The obvious point of comparison here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, the franchise's fourth main entry that was primarily developed by BioWare's now-shuttered Montreal team. This entry took a chattier, more youthful and adventurous tone than the sci-fi series' first three games - perhaps to be expected, considering the increasingly dire stakes and wartorn backdrop there. Still, the change was not well received.
</p><p>
But word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">Mass Effect 5, or whatever it ends up being called</a>, will feel closer to the original trilogy of games is not a surprise. We know from years of teases that BioWare's return to the franchise will pick up the story of the original trilogy's Milky Way galaxy many centuries later, and see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">the return of at least one familiar face</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for when Mass Effect 5 might arrive, BioWare has not yet said. Perhaps we might hear more on 7th November, the series' annual N7 Day fan celebration, when BioWare typically drops new information.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> brings back the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traditional Call of Duty Prestige system</a>, which sees players progress through the ranks without a seasonal level restriction, unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/">new weapons</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equipment</a> as they edge towards rank 55.

            <p>Two N64  games have now been added to the Mature app of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-2-seeds-of-evil">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> and Shadow Man are both available right now for subscribers with the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Both games were known for their blood and gore - unusual on Nintendo's system - hence their inclusion in the Mature app, alongside shooters Perfect Dark and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Mature app is a separate download away from the main N64 app.</p>
<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was, of course, the follow-up to the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> game, in which players shoot dinosaurs with a variety of outlandishly gruesome weapons.</p>
<p>Shadow Man, meanwhile, was based on the comic book series of the same name, following a voodoo warrior with the ability to visit the land of the dead.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia.1021752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Spider dislikers, your concerns have been noted. At least by Capcom, anyway. The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> are including an option in the upcoming beast-skinning action RPG that will turn all arachnid style monsters into something much less creepy and/or crawly. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The spider-free option was spotted by players of the PlayStation Plus beta test (as noticed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-features-an-accessibility-mode-for-players-who-fear-spiders-and-insects/">by Automaton</a>). It's called "Arachnophobia assistance" in the accessibility options, and reads: "Adjusts the appearance of multi-legged creatures such as arachnids, insect-like small monsters, and endemic life." The description also notes that it won't alter the difficulty or "creature movements". </p>
<p>So how does it deal with eight-legged monsters? They <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029-39053-001.jpg">become slimes</a>, of course. As Automaton note, so far only small monsters appear to be accounted for. It's not clear how larger monsters with spider-like legs will be altered, if at all. What even counts as "spider-like" anyway? When your game is full of hybrid creatures that take inspiration from all sorts of wildlife, that line where a phobia kicks in may be hard to define. </p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is not the first game to do this sort of thing. Even this week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> came out with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">an arachnophobia mode in its zombies campaign</a>. Meanwhile, shrunken survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a> has an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-groundeds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-creepy-spiders-into-cute-blobs">extensive arachnophobia mode</a> that lets you disable or enable every individual element of what makes a spider scary. You can get rid of the legs but keep the fangs, for example. Or just turn it into a harmless pair of spheres. </p><p>The PC beta for Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-beta-launches-this-month-with-a-character-editor-and-co-op-multiplayer">isn't arriving on Steam until October 31st</a>, so we won't be able to investigate the monstrous wilderness ourselves just yet. But if you do play, you'll be able to import your character when the full game releases on February 28th next year (actual progression through the game's opening chapter will not be saved though, say Capcom).  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> has had its early access release date pushed back until December.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear Games' take on Diablo was expected to release this November. However, due to some "server-side infrastructure work" that still needs sorting out, Path of Exile 2 will now be released in December.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off and things like that around our launches, but we just have to do it," Path of Exile 2 game director Jonathan Rogers said in a video announcing the delay.</p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 itself is in good shape, the director stated, though to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mercenary-class-unveiled-for-path-of-exile-2-and-it-plays-like-shooter">microtransactions work seamlessly across both Path of Exile and the sequel</a>, a little more time is needed.</p>
<p>"We have to integrate the account systems for not only <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile">Path of Exile</a> 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well," Rogers explained. "This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well."</p><p>The Path of Exile 2 team wants to ensure everything is "perfect" on the game's early access launch, Rogers continued, so "nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken". This means "a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn't fall over" on Path of Exile 2's debut, he added, as Grinding Gear is expecting a "huge number" of players.</p>
<p>Rogers admitted things had been left too late to get everything up to snuff for Path of Exile 2's November release date. "I'm really sorry," he apologised again, "this one really hurts".</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will now be released in early access on 6th December. Ahead of this, the developer plans to host a live stream in roughly four weeks time, with an exact date still to be confirmed. Rogers promised the team will share more on what kind of content players can expect on Path of Exile 2's launch during this stream.</p>
<p>"Until then, thank you very much for your support," Rogers concluded.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced changes to its big new Gigantamax battles feature, in response to this weekend's initial launch.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-launches-gigantamax-raids-to-mixed-response-as-developer-bans-countless-players-by-accident">Fan feedback to Gigantamax has been decidedly mixed</a>, as Eurogamer reported yesterday, with concerns over the difficulty level of being able to beat the skyscraper-high monsters, and the ease of then actually catching one afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Niantic has responded swiftly, and in a statement to Eurogamer last night a company spokesperson detailed a number of changes for the game's next set of Gigantamax raids this weekend, against Gigantamax Gengar. 
</p>
<p>
Most notably, the difficulty of Gigantamax Gengar will be lowered "slightly", to make the battle easier when compared to other Gigantamax battles. 
</p>
<p>
"While we want Gigantamax to be the new high bar for a meaningful challenge in Pok√©mon Go, we want to make sure that players have a reasonable chance to defeat Gengar," a Niantic spokesperson told Eurogamer. "You'll still need to strategise and coordinate with your group and go in powered up to a degree, but we think this tuning will make things slightly easier to help a range of Trainers jump into Gigantamax."
</p><p>
Here, Niantic seems to agree with a common complaint I heard this past weekend - that the feature could have benefited from giving players more of a leg-up to get started. Once you have your first Gigantamax Pok√©mon (and after a battle or two to learn the ropes), the whole thing becomes easier. 
</p>
<p>
Other changes to Gigantamax Gengar include a bonus 25k Stardust reward for beating the boss, and an improved capture rate for snagging it afterwards.
</p>
<p>
"We want players to feel rewarded for accomplishing such a huge feat, and right now the catch rate didn't match the experience we wanted," a Niantic spokesperson said. "We'll be increasing this for Gengar and will continue to monitor other Gigantamax encounters."
</p>
<p>
There's no changes to the game's Max Particle limit, which effectively caps the amount of Gigantamax raids you can complete at two without purchasing more of the currency from Pok√©mon Go's shop. And there's certainly no suggestion you will be able to complete Gigantamax Gengar battles without still forming a large group of players.
</p><p>
Also, it's worth highlighting that these changes are specifically for Gigantamax Gengar this weekend, in a manner that suggests Niantic realises it needs to throw the game's community something of a bone to encourage participation in the feature once again. 
</p>
<p>
Could these changes stick? "Other Gmax encounters are unaffected for now," a Niantic spokesperson said, "but we MAY make changes to them in the future."

			<p>It‚Äôs time to pop on your Phrygian caps and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GYtgFdXCGE">blue yourself</a> for a new Smurfs adventure. The Smurfs ‚Äì Dreams takes the top-down 3D platformer and runs with it in ways that show that Ocellus Studio (previously responsible for the excellent Marsupilami tie-in game) have totally understood the assignment. Dreams is not quite at the level of the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> or Nintendo‚Äôs best, but it is a great alternative if you‚Äôve played those already.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Smurfs ‚Äì Dreams ‚Äì Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Dtl9DiYc4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a generic Smurf, though in contrast to my youth, you do get to choose between a boy and a girl character. Compared to when there was only ever Smurfette to represent an entire gender, it seems there are more female Smurfs nowadays and you do get to rescue a fairly equal number of each throughout your somnolent adventure. There are a number of costumes available to lock with some exclusively present as DLC for the diehard Smurf fans. Many of these surprisingly give you the chance to change the iconic blue skin to other shades, which just feels wrong to me.</p>


<p>As you begin the game the sneaky Gargamel has found a way to poison the Smurfs‚Äô favourite berries with a sleeping potion, leaving the entire village helpless against him. What follows is a race against time as you must venture into their dreams and awaken them before Gargamel finds the hidden village and captures everybody. This mechanic enables a range of different platforming environments and mechanics to roughly match the character of each sleeping Smurf.</p>


<p>Most of your time in Dreams will be spent jumping and collecting items whilst avoiding or defeating enemies. The perspective and platforming approaches are very reminiscent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/10/super-mario-3d-world-switch-review-bowsers-fury/">Super Mario 3D World</a> and some levels do reach for the heights of that game. As a whole, however, Smurfs Dreams lacks the variety and magic spark of Mario‚Äôs adventure, though it does have some tricks of its own. Across your playtime you‚Äôll be tasked with using hammers, magical lanterns and a strange gunge firing gun to successfully rescue your pals.</p>
<p>Early levels here are pretty simple affairs and you‚Äôd be forgiven for thinking that you were playing a very easy kid‚Äôs game. Don‚Äôt be lulled into this sense of security, though, as The Smurfs ‚Äì Dreams does throw a lot of strong design decisions and even some surprisingly challenging platforming sections towards the end. The highlight here is a level <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/the-smurfs-dreams-preview-the-3d-platformer-to-drive-away-your-blues/">featured in the demo</a> which makes innovative use of mirrors to confuse and disorientate you and offers some genuinely original and innovative moments. Equally, trying to locate all of the collectables will offer up a decent challenge, albeit not on the scale of something like Astro Bot.</p>

<p>Every main level is separated into individual chapters, a welcome move when it comes to replaying parts to track down missing collectables. There are yarn bobbins unlocked by finding cunningly camouflaged Smurfs, blue mushrooms that are generally in obscure or hidden areas, and lots of berries used to unlock costumes. You‚Äôll find enough of the latter so that you won‚Äôt ever need to grind, even if you make your way through finding most rarer collectables. The game as a whole does respect your time and doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		The Smurfs ‚Äì Dreams is a welcome throwback to classic 3D platformers and makes for a good snackable game if you‚Äôve already played the likes of Astro Bot or the Mario games (or don‚Äôt have the relevant consoles for them). It‚Äôll keep you well entertained for the 7 or 8 hours it lasts and there are plenty of hidden secret collectables to hunt out. Whether you have any nostalgia for the Smurfs or are new to them you could do a lot worse than to have a snooze with the blues.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-will-keep-a-stable-frame-rate-at-all-times-promises-developer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We're now less than a month away from the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2</a>, which in itself seems impossible to process. The game has had so many delays (some forced on the developers by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, for example) that even the most attached fans were skeptical at some point.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 is almost here, though. GSC Game World recently hosted a final press event in Prague where they shared a few extra details about their game. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1msvzkT1d8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by Radio Times Gaming, for example, Technical Producer Yevhenii Kulyk talked about optimization after the interviewer mentioned the many recent Unreal Engine games suffering from stuttering issues on PC.</p>
<p><em>To meet our expectations for optimization on Xbox and PCs, we made a lot of changes to render threads, some CPU optimizations, and a lot of RAM optimizations. Now we are pretty much close to finishing the whole polishing process. Our aim is to provide a game that is running constantly in stable FPS and with stable performance all the time.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the Unreal Engine 5 version they've been using, Kulyk said:</p>
<p><em>Our engine is based on Unreal Engine 5.1, but we internally call it 5.1.GSC because to make a world this big, we had to adopt and, let's say, maybe rewrite and upgrade some tools that were provided by the basic Unreal Engine to fit our needs to create the world of STALKER 2.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-dev-says-ue5s-nanite-and-lumen-were-the-right-bricks-to-properly-finish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> on the news of upgrading from UE4 to UE5, stating that Lumen and Nanite were the 'right bricks' to finish the game. However, Epic introduced several performance and quality improvements to both technologies in the more recent UE5 versions; let's hope staying on an older, albeit custom, build won't jeopardize the performance. After all, the team seems confident in their promise of a smooth frame rate.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kulyk reiterated what we already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> in our exclusive Gamescom interview: mods are coming, to both PC and consoles.</p>
<p><em>We are aware that our player base, especially the old fans, is waiting for our game to support mods. We will bring in the mods to consoles, so they will be available on the Xbox as well as the PC We are preparing a very big toolkit that will provide the mod makers with all the necessary tools to create mods, from the smallest one to big total conversions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>STALKER 2 is out on November 20 on PC and Xbox Series S|X, available from day one on Game Pass. A PlayStation 5 release hasn't been publicly talked about yet, but we know from a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-a-3-month-console-exclusive-microsoft-will-increase-revenue-share-for-xbox-games-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a three-month exclusivity window in place, so the game could launch on Sony's console in early 2025.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>'s early access release has been shoved back three weeks from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/path-of-exile-2-will-release-in-early-access-november-15th">15th November</a> to 6th December 2024, game director Jonathan Rogers has announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s">a brief Youtube video</a>. The action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> itself will seemingly be ready in time for the original launch date, but there's a load of "server-side infrastructure work" that needs doing.</p> <!--more-->
<p>"One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2," Rogers said in the video, as passed on by charming RPS doppelganger <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/this-really-hurts-path-of-exile-2-early-access-has-been-delayed-by-three-weeks/">PCGamer</a>. "In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2, but also for the console realms as well.</p>
<p>"This meant changing a lot of things: not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that all the old data is backwards compatible with them as well. And when you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons."</p>
<p>Old certainly means <em>old</em>, when it comes to Path Of Exile. The original game launched in 2013.</p>
<p>Rogers detailed a few of the aforesaid "strange demons" - accounts sharing the same email address and steam IDs, and accounts that consist of "random gibberish". Purging them will go hand in hand with additional load-testing to ensure the backend code changes don't screw the game up at launch.</p><p>"I actually believe that we possibly could have made the original launch date, but I'm no longer confident that we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of games we just can't let happen," Rogers continued. "So with that in mind, we've decided to delay. Now this one's totally on me. I just didn't leave enough time to make sure we could get it done."</p>
<p>This is as fine a time as any to say that I played a bit of Path Of Exile 2 at Summer Games Fest and - speaking as an extremely greenhorn POE player, so green that I still giggle like a schoolboy when people call it "peeowee" - found it to be quite fun. I was some kind of necromancer, I think. I basically spent my 30 minutes resurrecting enemy corpses while backpedalling furiously. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-to-expect-from-the-path-of-exile-2-beta-and-how-grinding-gears-are-breaking-their-own-rules">a crossbow-wielding class in POE2</a> which looks like it'll be catnip for the twin-stick shmuppers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has announced a slight delay to the early access date of Path of Exile 2. The sequel to the highly popular free-to-play hack 'n' slash action RPG will now debut on December 6 instead of November 15 as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-on-november-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>Game Director Jonathan Rogers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2zus8ux73s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the news in a brief video message and explained that it was caused by server-side shortcomings:</p>
<p><em>I'm really sorry about this one. People plan time off around our launches, but we just have to do it. So what happened? Well, it turns out it isn't really the game itself that we're behind on. It's a bunch of server side infrastructure work that has taken us a lot longer than we expected.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the key promises we made is that all your microtransactions will work across both Path of Exile 1 and 2. In order to do that, we have to integrate the account systems for not only Path of Exile 1 and 2 but also for the console realms as well. This meant changing a lot of things. Not only do we have to create a bunch of new systems, we have to make sure that only old data is backwards compatible with them as well.</em></p>
<p><em>When you start migrating databases that are this old and with this much data, you find all sorts of strange demons in there. How do multiple accounts get the same name? How do multiple accounts get the same email address? How do multiple accounts have the same steam IDs? Why is this person‚Äôs account name just random gibberish that doesn't even decode? We have to get everything perfect so that nobody loses anything they paid for and nobody has their account broken.</em></p>
<p><em>At the same time, because we're changing all this back-end code, we have to do a lot of load testing to make sure the whole thing doesn‚Äôt fall over when they could get the huge number of players that we're expecting at the Path of Exile 2 early access launch. I actually believe that we could possibly have made the original date, but I'm no longer confident we could do it without making mistakes, and these are the kind of mistakes we just can't let happen. With that in mind, we've decided to delay.</em></p>
<p>Rogers ended the message with news of an upcoming live stream that will delve deeply into everything that's going to be in the early access launch. The Game Director said it's going to be like the biggest League announcement they have ever done, and he added he's looking forward to sharing information on the endgame content players will find in Path of Exile 2.</p>

<p>One PlayStation player has spent $2000 on 24 years of PS Plus to avoid future price hikes.</p>



<p>Reddit user /u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1gbag2i/lads_i_did_it_subscribed_to_ps_plus_until_2048/?embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fplaystation-plus-user-subscription-24-years-2048%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On_Reddit_In_Class</a>&nbsp;took to the website to say they they made the plunge to avoid ‚Äúthe absurd price increases the past few years,‚Äù which promoted the user to buy PS Plus until 2048. </p>



<p>Users reacted with mixed emotions in the Reddit thread, with some calling it a genius move, but only if the services last for that amount of time. Others morbidly said that it‚Äôs only good if he ‚Äúlast that long.‚Äù </p>



<p>Sony last raised its prices for PS Plus in September 2023 from $59.99 to $79.99, so who knows how much the service could be in the next two decades. The past two decades has seen the industry change various times, too, but whatever the case may be, it‚Äôll probably work out at being good value for money. After all, if the service is cancelled, he‚Äôs almost certainly going to get some kind of refund‚Ä¶ Right?</p>



<p>What do you think about buying 24 years worth of PS Plus? Do you think it‚Äôs a wise investment or a stupid move?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/blade-and-sorcery-nomad-full-release-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad never felt as fleshed out or high-tier as the PCVR version of the game, but yesterday, that changed. The developer, WarpFrog, has pushed out ‚ÄòThe End Update‚Äô, the full release of Nomad that brings it up to spec and makes it feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs not without issues, but this change boosts the game‚Äôs graphics, frame rate, performance, and sound effects. It also adds the core progression mode, which gives you something to aim for when you play.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs like Cyberpunk 2077‚Äôs ‚Äò2.0‚Äô update. It has made Nomad feel like an entirely new game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-overhauled">Overhauled</h2>



<p>Let‚Äôs get the downsides out of the way before we talk about Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad‚Äôs full release.</p>



<p>When you install The End Update, you‚Äôll lose all your mods as they‚Äôll be incompatible. It‚Äôs advised that you hit ‚ÄòUninstall All‚Äô on your mod list before you proceed, as even having them installed could cause issues with your update. That‚Äôs a massive hit for anyone like me who previously had dozens of mods installed.</p>



<p>Another issue I have is with the combat ‚Äì decapitation seems to be bizarrely easy, and simply tapping an enemy with a sword results in their head popping off. I‚Äôm not sure why, but it‚Äôs irritating.</p>



<p>That‚Äôs about it when it comes to issues.</p>



<p>The biggest talking point about The End Update is the addition of Crystal Hunt, which is Blade &amp; Sorcery‚Äôs core progression mode. With this mode, you‚Äôll get to pick a path and follow it with a new character, exploring an all-new world, never-before-seen (for Nomad) races and factions, and a gameplay loop that gives the game more of a <strong>point</strong>.</p>



<p>Here‚Äôs what WarpFrog had to say about the introduction of Crystal Hunt:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The addition of Crystal Hunt was sheer madness for us because it was like dropping a new game on top of the established Blade &amp; Sorcery game that you already know. Then trying to make that work for the standalone headset‚Ä¶ it was insanity fuel. However, here we are.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There‚Äôs a skill tree to work through, a trading system, immense new enemies, and a stack of lore and puzzles to unfold and uncover. The graphical improvements are nothing short of stunning, and as someone who poured hours upon hours into Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad before the update, the changes are <strong>night and day</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Everything from the ambient sounds to the effects of spells, and from the detail on weapons to the way enemies behave mid-fight has been changed for the better. </p>



<p>It took me a good few minutes to get to grips with the changes, including the new inventory menu and journal system, but it was worth sticking to it. I cannot stress how impressive The End Update is. Let‚Äôs rattle through some more bonuses:</p>



<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs a new stash system and the ‚Äòhome‚Äô is persistent when it comes to adding and moving things around</li>



<li>Modders can now take full control of the SDK</li>



<li>Enemy mages are now wild and have immense powers</li>



<li>Enemy AI is much more realistic, particularly in combat</li>



<li>The existing Arena maps have been overhauled</li>



<li>The new armour sets and weapons feel and look superb</li>



<li>For the first time, there‚Äôs a voiced and animated NPC shopkeeper</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this monumental change has brought about a sharp price increase. Before, Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad would have run you up a bill of just $19.99, but that has been increased to $29.99 to account for the overhaul update.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>The End Update makes one of the best games on VR even better. I didn‚Äôt know it was coming, so it was a <strong>very </strong>welcome surprise, but if you‚Äôve been holding out waiting for the full release of Blade and Sorcery: Nomad, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. This feels like WarpFrog has given us an entirely new game, and it‚Äôs worth every second you spend exploring it.</p>

Since Spider-Man is a very popular Halloween costume, we suppose it fits the theme--and both games are nearly 50% off, so they are awesome deals regardless. Most of the games in the sale are Steam keys that can be redeemed instantly.</p><p>The standalone discounts are complemented by the new <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-frightmare-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhorror-game-sale-features-scary-good-deals-on-silent-hill-2-cult-of-the-lamb-and-more%2F1100-6527424%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">build-your-own Frightmare Bundle</a></strong> with 19 games to choose from, including Doom (2016), The Evil Within 1 and 2, and Dead Island Definitive Collection, which actually comes with three games.

The remake features radically improved gameplay and modernized graphics with support for advanced tech like ray tracing, so it's a great match for high-end gaming rigs. It also benefits from a new over-the-shoulder perspective. This deal disappears after Halloween, however, so you don‚Äôt have much time left to cash in on the offer.
